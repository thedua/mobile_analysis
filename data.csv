13	Picture quality is superb,  battery life is fine & durability is amazing	5
14	The phone design and model looks good. But the charging it took is like more than 3 hours at times. Don't buy who concern for battery durability. Seriously this is not worth for it. Of course it can standby for a whole day for that you have to charge like more than 3 hours. Overall not suitable for heavy amount of usage.	2

18	Good mobile ........All are good, battery really lasts upto two days with single charge, no hang issues, camera out door and indoor with adequate lighthing is really good, but low light case it is average only also it takes more time to shutter at night time photography which can be overcome with thirdparty camera apps, audio is little bit low, image has more  noise with zoom, signal strengths are good.,.........READ MORE	5

21	Amazing camera ...	5
22	Just got my p20 lite after using honor v10, I bought it as a secondary driver and I must say Huawei’s P20 Lite is a good mid range badboy. like how lightweight and elegant it is, and has a very similar premium design to its more expensive P20 siblings. I recommend to those who want elegant look plus lag free performance.	5

46	After usage of one month, Iam giving this review honesty.Thanks to amazon for next day delivery. As soon as I received my mobile, it has a battery problem. whole battery was draining in 2 hours. Amazon replaced my mobile the next day after replacement request. Now Iam giving the review of replaced mobile.Pros:4GB RAM is very good, still 2.5gb is free even after installing heavy games.looks are very good.Back camera is good capturing nice pictures.Front is not like 24mp, its like 16mpDisplay is HD, But beware of the glass, my mobile screen broken as it was felldown from knee height. So better use the tampered glass.Cons:speaker is not upto the markEarphones provided are not of noise cancellation.Front cam they said its 24mp but it works like 16mpEven on full brightness, you cannot see the display in the mobile.Battery is not sufficient for 4gb ramPoor display glass quality, mobile screen damaged as it felt down just from my knee height.Strucks a lot while surfing internet even 2.5gb ram is free	3

131	Pros:+ Dual SIM Slot with Dedicated micro SD Slot.+ Crystal clear 5.5 1080p full HD + Full Vision Display.+ The frame is Made of 7000-grade Aluminium.+ Face recognition/ KnockCode for Unlocking the phone.+ OTG Cable is supported.+ NFC is supported by the device.+ Built on Military standard 810G certification.Cons:- The under-powered processor for multitasking or heavy Gaming.- No Type-C USB Slot.- The battery is non-removable.- The Camera especially Secondary is not up to the mark.- Speaker located at the back with mediocre sound.- It is disappointing to see the mid-range phone without fingerprint scanner.Final words:LG Q6 in the market with FullVision 5.5 inches FHD display which looks incredible while holding in hands or putting them on the table. The CPU is not as expected but definitely, delivers a decent performance for day to day use.	3

206	Good phone but considering the feature it provides , the price i feel is  high. Although it says it says 5.5 inch phone but very small in size. Also no cast screen feature. But Camera is very good. If you are looking for a compact Iphone type mobile then this looks similar.	3

208	Picture quality is good but still needs to be improved. Performance is far better than other mid budget phones. We can say it's very smooth and awesome.  Battery life is decent. Will last for a day with normal usage. Little bit disappointed with camera performance but still worth of money.	4

219	You must Read This Review before spending your hard earned 16k rupees, it's really great amount.Honest, unbiased  and in-depth review of Lg q6Read carefully.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Display and Design----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------First and foremost I must address the display on this device. I believe most of you would agree with me that the LG Q6 is a looker. Kudos to LG for bringing their flagship tech to the budget segment, reaching a wider audience range than flagships do. As you must have heard, LG calls this a Full Vision display. Essentially, the display is a little taller than the standard 1080p resolution. It rocks a 2160 x 1080p resolution, which takes the aspect ratio from the standard 16:9 to 18:9. In tandem, the top and bottom bezels have been drastically minimised, which adds to the phone’s unique look. Moreover, the Full Vision display not only makes the phone look good, but makes the whole footprint smaller. This means, the LG Q6 with its 5.5-inch display, is just a hair bigger than the 5-inch Lenovo Z2 Plus.As for the display quality, it is a top notch panel and can easily be regarded as one of the best in the category. Viewing angles are very good and the colour saturation, though a bit warm, is favourable for viewing all kinds of content. It is easily viewable outdoors and under direct sunlight, and with luminance readings of 605 lux, offers ample brightness as well. The display has Gorilla Glass 3 protection on top for scratch protection and the touch response is quite good.What I did find a little disappointing is the fact that not a lot of apps can make use of the extra screen space made available on this phone. However, LG is a still an early adopter of the screen resolution and as more phones join the bunch, developers will also start implementing the screen resolution in their respective apps.Complementing the display is the overall design of the device, which makes the Q6 look like a miniaturised version of the G6. the metal side rails, along with the glossy plastic back give the phone an upmarket look. It is well weighted and quite ergonomic for the screen size it offers.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Build quality----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------While the display makes the phone enticing, it also adds a sense of fragility. LG claims that its H-beam chassis is more than capable of handling those occasional bumps and drops. The frame itself is made out of 7000 series aluminium, which marketing jargon will tell you is an aerospace grade material. Although, to put it relatively, that has been used in smartphones for ages. I have been using the phone for a few days now and it does feel quite sturdy in hand. The edges are metallic and rounded, which makes the phone easier to grip. While Gorilla Glass 3 protects the display from scratches, the plastic back gets scratched quite easily. The Gorilla Glass 3 display is also flat and not curved.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UI and features----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------LG hasn't changed its UI significantly in terms of design and functionality since the LG G6. So, you still get a very colourful interface with no app drawer. LG tries to ease the user into the UI from the very beginning, with tutorials and pop-cards for almost all aspects and functions of the device. It will give you pop-ups to explain what you should do if your phone becomes unresponsive by chance or how you can add a fourth shortcut in the navigation panel at the bottom.LG has duplicate apps for almost all Google apps, which seems unnecessary. These apps not only take up space, but will slow down the update process in the long run. This is due to the fact that like any other company, LG will bring Android O to its flagships first and then to other phones.Coming back to the phone at hand, I am disappointed to see that the device does not feature a fingerprint scanner. However, the Q6 comes with a “face unlock” feature, that works, but is a little slow for my liking.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Performance----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------While the face unlock is slow, the performance of the phone itself is slower. Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 SoC and 3GB of RAM, the LG Q6 can barely keep up with the competition on synthetic benchmarks. That being said, if you are not into heavy gaming or don’t use processor intensive tasks, such as video editing apps, then you would find the overall experience of the phone good enough. You can have multiple (more than 20) apps in the task manager, download videos on Amazon Prime in the background and watch or stream YouTube videos at the same time, without the phone stutteringThe only time I had issues with the performance was when I played games like Injustice 2 and Vainglory on it. The phone kept stuttering and one could see noticeable frame drops throughout the gameplay. At the same time, you can try games like Daddy Long Legs and Card Thief, which just about work fine.4G connectivity is also good and the Q6 supports dual VoLTE SIM cards slots. It also features a dedicated external memory card slot in extension to the 32GB internal storage. The speaker on the back side could have been louder, but I do find the audio quality via headphones decent.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Battery life----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The LG Q6 brings a 3000mAh battery to the table, which is good enough for normal users. Using the phone as a daily driver I found that its battery is highly efficient and maintains its battery life quite well, even if you indulge in watching YouTube videos a lot. There is even a “game battery saver” mode, which adjusts the battery consumption and extend battery life. Although, that is something you won't need, as you can’t really game on the phone. The device scored 5 hours and 1 minutes on the PCMark benchmark, which isn't exceptional, but still workable, as the phone lasts a day easily even if you’re a heavy user.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Camera----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like the battery life, the rear 13MP camera on the LG Q6 is also just about good enough. Images taken in all lighting conditions look rather subdued, but have ample details and sharpness. Images do tend to be grainy, as you move to low light settings, but most images do look usable. I believe the camera could have achieved more with a manual mode, but LG has kept the camera app very lackluster. Apart from panorama and food mode, the phone doesn't really let you tweak settings further.There are the usual filters and you can switch between auto mode or LG’s own square mode, which it introduced with the G6. The front facing 5MP camera also has the wide angle and normal selfie camera modes, taken from the G6. The image quality here is again just good enough, with softer focus, cleaning blemishes and dark spots. There is a skin tone slider as well, but unless you are outside in ample light conditions, the camera won’t do justice to your face or skin tone in selfies. Needless to say, selfies in low light or even under incandescent light are just not good enough.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Final Opinion----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This brings us to the conclusion of the LG Q6 review, which makes me both happy and sad. I am happy that LG finally took it upon itself to change how budget segment smartphones should look. The Q6 now sets the precedent for how a sub-15K smartphone or anything around this price should be designed. At the same time, I am somewhat disappointed that the performance of the Q6 is somewhat disappointing and sub-par compared to our recommended choices. The phones especially lacks the gaming prowess we have now accustomed ourselves to in the sub-15K smartphone category.As to answer the burning question, yes, the LG Q6 is recommendable phone if and only if you are not a very heavy user. The phone offers a brilliant display, a usable camera, is well built and has decent battery life as well.ThankYouIf you really liked the review or it helped you in any way please press YES button belowYou can ask question in comments below.	4

304	"I purchased this for my wife and got it delivered with 24 hours.  It's net cost to me was 10,799/- by exchanging my wife's 4 year old S4 (which was end of life with slow response and half-day battery life). I also took the 9 month no cost EMI option.We are very happy with phone. My wife uses it mainly for phone calls, WhatsApp and Facebook. All these are functioning very well. Phone is fast. Obviously we do not intend to have any heavy games installed.Battery life is very good. I opened the phone last night at 9 pm and battery was at 90% of of the box. I didn't charge it. Set it up with the Google account, necessary apps and settings. Have been using it on 4g all along. As of 2 pm today, battery was at 28% and this was after lot of phone calls and 4g data being on full time. No WiFi. Have kept the auto-brightness on and screen brightness at 50%.Fyi-It has 2 sim card slots and a dedicated memory card slot. NO hybrid sim slot luckily.It doesn't have a fingerprint scanner but it has the double - tap to wake/sleep feature as well as face recognition, which are both very very useful features and help in using phone with one hand. The face recognition works very well for me. Face recognition has 2 modes, one where you wake up the screen first and then look at the phone to unlock it and another mode where you just look at the phone (while the screen is off), and it recognises your face, turns on the screen and unlocks by itself. I found this second mode the best as I need not even move any fingers to press power button or double-tap. I just pick up the phone in my hand and look at it to start using it.The screen is gorgeous and excellent. Build quality is also very very good as body is aluminium. The phone is also very easy to hold and use with one hand, especially considering its 5.5"" screen.Call quality is good as we have been able to make and receive calls easily from areas in our house that generally have poor mobile network signal.I am fully satisfied with this phone."	5
305	Battery is not good	3
306	Not sure if my device is defective. Whenever I switch on the phone my device gets heated on the rear part of volume rocker. When it's on power saver mode it is fine.Overall the handset works fine in other aspects. I hope LG may resolve it with an update in the future.20-Sep-2017After recent updates, this phone doesn't heat up as previously. Battery backup is also good. Overall good, but little overpriced per the current market standard	3

319	On 16th day after purchase I suddenly found Q6's display as blacked out, I don't know how & why. I couldn't ask for return or replacement from Amazon, as the purchase has just crossed 15 days after delivery. The only option I had was to hand over to my faulty Q6 to one of the service station in Kolkata. And, I was informed from the service center that it would take min of 7-10 days for getting the display replaced as Q6 is recently launched and they donot have any parts readily available. I tried to get help from LG Helpline & its Areas Service Manager in Kolkata if they could fasten the process. And to my surprise I received a call from the Service Center today that it will take at least 7 days according to their system and I have to follow it. Thanks LG !!!	2

335	More than pathetic...  Don't waste money on this product.. Even trying ro return this product but amazon not ready to accept...	1
336	Good phone go ahead a little but heavy and thick not sleek at all. If you want a super thin phone don't go for it. Processor is good and display is good too. Picture quality is above average and Redmi is not famous for its camera. Overall a good product you will not regret buying it. Also PUBG works flawlessly in this phone no lag at all.	5
337	This is my first Xiaomi phone. I am lucky to have in cart during first flash sale. This is the best budget phone. You'll find many YouTube reviews criticizing this beast but I didn't care about those reviews so I ordered it. It is facing criticism over no 3.5 mm jack and no expandable memory but I've no problem with since my previous phone was Leeco le2 which also doesn't come up with a 3.5 mm jack and no expendable memory, 64 gb is enough storage for any type of user. And no one uses earphones while phone on charge, also I use wireless earphones so I don't care whether it has 3.5 mm jack or not. Cameras are awesome as you can expect out of Mi phones. Low light photos are incredibly awesome even from front facing camera. One thing that I didn't know about this phone before buying is it has front camera flash. On the inside Snapdragon 660 AI processor gives this phone the best memory management better than Honor Play (you can do the side by side test) Honor play will open the apps faster (no more than 1 seconds) but it doesn't keeps the apps in the memory, but Mi A2 does. I don't have to say anything about the cameras since everyone knows it has best cameras. One thing that I didn't like about this phone is it's camera bump which is too much. But I don't care about it as well. It's cases have camera bump protection. I would prefer Amzer. You'll get your first designer case absolutely free.	5
338	Good phone with gorgeous screen , compact for easy one hand use.	5
339	A redmi 6 pro is the numbre one phone in the whole market that looks gracious, perfect, and the dimensions are accurate according to layout and styles that is perfect. There is no one to chhaleng redmi 6 pro	5

342	REVIEW AFTER 30 DAYS OF USAGE. 😍😍🤨🤨🙄It's great device under this price segment. If you need a great look & in hand feel and design go for it . Some Cons of this phone after using 30 days.1.

404	May 2018 : Final Verdict- This phone don't stand a chance in the market even at 10K. If you are planning to buy dont spend more than 7K. Now About the phone:1. OS: Android 7.1.1 1st April security patch  Till now update has came once in 2-3months though  its a small security patch update.  Android O : Don't know and also dont expect from LG2. Battrey: Running full day ,being used at home and also dont forget to Plug it at night bcoz this would take 2hr+3. Camera: Front is pathetic , rear is also not upto the mark but its Okayyy4. Resale value : LG has minimum resale value so if you are thinking of using for 3months and sell then it should cost you 50% of phone cost_____________________________________________________After 2Months :1. apply a bckcover just after unboxing it back is scratch magnet not Aluminium just plastic only side frame aluminium.2. No updates Android 7.1.1 on SEPT 2017 patch Dont know about Android O and P3. Screen- best part of this phone. Bright good contrast  levels good color saturation. I use AmoLED devices but the LCD panel on this phone impressed me. Also no Over-Saturation as seen on AmoLEDs.better than MI / Lenovo displays4. 18:9 Fullvision: Yes if you are lot on to WhatsApp/FB/INSTA...and social apps. Good for surfing web.No if you watch Movies/Videos or casual gamming (High end not possible) like CoC and CR and all. Discuss in detail about gamming.5. Software: I purchased LG G2 in 2013 and it was the best mob at that time(actually my brother 😂).UX has changed a bit like Default launcher MIUI type (can be switched back to UX 4 style) and some changes CAN BE OR CANNOT BE GOOD FOR People. LG killed Custom icon support in Default launcher, BAD.Overall its not tooo good skin6. Camera: Not comparing with G2 but Its just Okayyy. Front is not upto the mark. Also no dual tone flash At same price point There are better options avaibale with MORE POWER and Decent Camera7. Performace and Gaming : NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL! for gamming. Same price phones have 5X more power. Go for at least SD 625 for gamming and Multitasking. Fullvision creats problem for some games. Also games small games like Clash Royale lags in animation. General usage no problemAlso this has NO NFC as many sites show8. Music and Audio : Speaker placement is bad, no problem for Notifications.Headphone Jack (Test using : Sennheiser CX213 , SONY EAX14P , Apple Earpods , Samsung Galaxy S7E Headset) sound is good but nothing special ,only the placement of headphone jack which i like. Also NO DEFAULT EQ (MusixFX) so install apps like Powerapps which has powerfull EQ to get the most.9. Battrey : Do whatver experiment but no Quick charging , wait till 2Hr used Motorola Turbo Charger but not a much difference. Battrey life Decent. Also depends on your usage and running appsb,app wake-ups and all so no review about it.10. Further Support : LG is bad in terms of Software updates. Also dont know about Android Oreo on top of that ITS A NON-UNLOCKABLE DEVICE so forget about Cool Custom roms and allFinal verdict : for a phone around 12-13K fo for MI A1 or Other and if getting this in 10K then should definitely buy. Android O is comming with TONNES OF ENHANCEMENTS AND FEATURS so buying a Nougat OOB phone is not recommended , better wait for Android O devices hit the market as they will contain features that will not be avaible thorough OTA UPDATES to Android O like Project TrebleThank you!!	2

436	This is an update to the review after a month of heavy use. This is a very smooth phone. The OS is so well done using Android 7 as the base OS. Camera is more than good. Holding and using the phone is excellent. Overall quite an addictive phone.For the monies paid, I give it 5 stars and here is why:- Smallest/lightest possible 5.5 inch phone (feels like holding a iphone)- Works very fast (i don't play games)- Screen and touch are too good- LGs version/modifications of android 7 are smooth. So far no problems on software side as well- Auto brightness works well- Both cameras are good- None of the junk Chinese bloatware/softwares on this phoneOnly negative is bit of heating and that too of it being used continuously.	5

447	I went through many youtube videos and sites where they provide comparison of different companies phone and reviews about the same and then made the decision to purchase this one and after using honor 8x I can say , My decision of purchasing this phone was totally correct. It has much more than you need, everything at its best. No regrets. As of now and as per my decision this phone beats All other competitors like Xioami, Oppi, Vivo, Nokia, Moto , and so on selling phones in this range..and Service of Amazon was also good.	5
448	Display is good but it hanged on 3rd day of purchase	3
449	1.) Slow motion camera is very pathetic.2.) front camera is not up to the mark even honor 9 lite has far better front camera than honor 8x.3.) excellent battery life.4.)Stunning design.5.) Best rear camera in this price segment.6.)Takes nearly 3 hour for full charging lacks fast charging.	4

What an experience look at the video.Phone Is Superb By All Means Just One Thing The Camera Output Is Of Mixed Type. Some Times Gives Awesome Results Where As Some Times OK Ok But Options With Camera Are Too Good To Use.In Short Killer Look's, Awesome Design, Superb Display, Premium Build, OK Camera.	5

479	"I thought screen will be bigger as its 5""5 but it is smaller than my old 5 inch mobile! So something called aspect ratio (18:9 and not the usual 16:9) is the cause which I didn't realise earlier.Do not imagine a traditional 5""5 inch phone as that will disappoint you. This phone is small.I have used for more than a week and not faced any heating problem as yet. In fact the phone hardly heats up despite solid use.Liked the phone except the size which is too small for my liking. Cut 1 star only for that."	4

490	This is a great phone. With all Pros there is this one major ConAs the phone is missing the 3.5mm audio jack, you cannot charge the phone while watching a movie. This is really pathetic. Why do phone companies do such unnecessary innovations. Do give this a thought before buying itPros:Looks are awesomewith 6GB RAM the phone is fastScreen crystal clearAudio greatFast chargeBattery lasts good (i dont play games though)and yes the Camera - Best.. Portrait mode rocks \m/	5

493	King of budget segament with some brilliant features.	5
494	Phone is very good. But battery backup in poor. 3000mah battery is not enough for this phone.	5
495	Its the best choice.. i got it for 15k, apps need to be improved...	5
496	good	4
497	Have been using this mobile from past 1 week and honestly speaking I had too much confusion in my mind regarding this handset as most of the handset comparisons I read or watched said that the camera of the mobile is not up to the mark. I was totally confused between realme 2 pro and this one. But eventually I made my decision to go with this handset and it turned out to be a  right decision .Everything is so perfect in this handset plus looks of this handset is totally awesome. This is my second honor phone. First one was honor 9 lite.... and both of them are super.Happy purchasing :)PS: All those who are complaining about a camera are probably looking for a quality of 50k handset in 15k. Also camera should not be the only deciding factor when looking for a suitable handset. Performance of the device in other areas should also be valued and Honor NEVER dissapoints .	5
498	Very nice phone	5

594	It's a worthful item	5
595	Everything is awesome except front camera.	4
596	I am using this phone from last few days. As per my personal review this is not a good phone. It's cost should be around Rs. 5000 to 6000 as per quality.. Camera quality is average.I am very disappointed with Battery performance.Purchasing this phone is totally waistage of money.The most important think which i want to highlite that, there is heating problem in this phone.	1
597	Everything is cost effect	5
598	Best under 15k..better than mi phones	5
599	i love mi phones, its really good, camera quality are best, sound system also good, & its looks amazing...	5
600	The phone is amazing and worth buying, but the picture quality of the front camera is very bad. The phone is so smooth, cool and good looking. It's fingerprint and face unlock is very fast and efficient, the battery is really very good but only the front camera sucks. Games work smoothly on this phone without any lagging or hanging. The screen is 1080p HD supported and looks amazing. Overall I would rate this phone as 9/10.It would be 10/10 if the camera would be good. But I recommend everyone to buy this phone. Not recommended for the photography lovers.	5
601	The notch up display is hampering with some of the apps and making them crash. The picture quality and battery is amazing in this price range. Sound is also amazing. This is the best phone to buy in the price range	5
602	Picture quality of the phone is very dull during night,its good during dayBattery life is just perfect . Mobile can work 1 and a half day with a fair usage and approx. 22 hrs with a heavy usage	5
603	Products good at this price but the 12 + 5 mp rear camera does not give you the quality as expected	3
604	Superb display ! Gd battery life!But average camera!weight on the heavier side!	4

619	Overall good quality	5
620	Bought it for Rs 10000.Starting with the looks : its fine. Actually, good. Looks slim. The notch is refreshing.Camera : Front camera is just fine. Just does the job. Nothing extraordinary.Back camera is dual setup. Blurring or portrait mode doesn't work in low light and if the subject is large or far/close.Pictures are fine in day light.Battery : Lasts easily for a day with moderate use with even some juice left.Sound : Is low. Not a very good speaker. In fact it's disappointing.	4
621	Sound quality is good.	5
622	Best of Honor in this budget.	5

630	Battery backup is good	5
631	Should have better sound	4
632	I must say about this phone and guys seriously I'll give you a genuine feedback.Screen quality is little bit good and touch quality is also okayGlossy finishingI bought this phone is 11kSo didn't expect more from this. For normal is this phone is a best option under 20k phone.And camera quality is also good if I compare with others brand like vivo and oppo and MI too.But this phn has some heat problems not so heated but when we use normally this phn is heated and also hand for a sec also.Over all phone is good	5
633	I got this phone at 13499 .And I got a cash back of 1000 alsoSo I got it at 12500The phone is very good,very stylishCamera is awesomeBetter then mia1 as my previous phone was a1 so I also know the camera of a1Battery life is also good.I charged it 100 % this morning and at 7 pm ,it was 30,40 ....and I used the phone whole dayThe only thing I dislike is that back camera is a little bit outside.....so u need a 360 degree protection for ur camera .	5
634	Worth priced and all the features mind blowing	5
635	Pictures taken are awesome, speech quality is good,  only concern not 3.5 jack for headphone,  no memory card slot.  These are nothing compared to features offering for 14999	5
636	VALUE FOR MONEY	4
637	Phone is very attractive in look.After using it for almost 3 month after i felt battery backup can be a issue for you if you keep wifi, location, data on all the time.Display is very good and phone is very sleek and handy.I feel speaker voulme is bit low. Call volume is preety good.	3
638	Decent phone for this price segment.	4

667	Overall LG Q6 Full Vision is very light and compact handy cell phone. Specifications wise is very good, I feel the battery capacity of this phone should be more 4000 mAh. Rest you will like it once you up the cell. Display wise it's really good beat the other cell phone which is recently launched in Market.	4
668	Evey things good except sound adjustment	4

672	Camera quality good but not as per expectation.	4
673	Good product.  Value for money.	4
674	I am using it since last 6 months and I am facing a lot of problems sharing some of them1 - battery back up is worst, lasts for only 3 hour's when 100 charged2 - most of the times it doesn't shows on which technology, 2g 3g 4g, I am latched on3 - front camera is very poor and blur4 - Slow charging is like in night at 11 I put it on charging and in the morning at 6 it shows 95% charged5- it hangs very frequently6- on video call no matters you have put it on charging or not the battery level will go down7- attached a snap of charging of last night I'm which you can clearly see that for 20 to 80% it took 6 hours and for next 17 percent it needs 53 mints	1
675	The phone is awesome looking and performs well enough, feels 40k mobile in hand, battery life awful	5
676	Great device	5
677	18:9 full vision display . Very very good . Always lg is good product provide...	5
678	Battery is good & overall performance is also good but screen is bit small	5
679	Start hanging	4
680	I bought this phone on the launch day and got a great discount of 6700 on my Redmi 3s Prime effectively bringing down the price to 8300. I have used the phone for a week now and I can say that the display is the main highlight of this phone. Its amazing for watching videos and also helps while clicking pictures because of the large viewfinder. The phone itself is good for medium users. The phone doesn't lag with loads of apps and about 15 chrome tabs open & the battery backup is also good. Lasts me a day with a few hours of calls, clicking pics, net browsing, lots of whatsapp and a couple of hours of Youtube. The fingerprint scanner is sorely missed. Would have been great if they launched it at around 18000 with the fingerprint scanner, led notification light and SD 626/626. Would have been a world beater then.Overall a good phone for the price I paid along with no cost EMI.	5
681	I like u handset but battery is 3000mha not good..	5
682	They should have kept the memory card option and also the battery capacity	3
683	Excellent phone by lg,good for regular use and easy to handle.	4
684	This mobile is having the following problems.1. Bluetooth Headset not connecting.2. Volume is fluctuating.Shall I replace or any solution for this.	3
685	Not that good as expected	4
686	Worst performance and battery  drains very fast and network issues  and amazon is not accepting return .application lags to open and network goes off automatically.	1
687	I always believe in Mi .....Excellent phone...✌	5
688	Picture quality is good.Nokia is nokia .It is the valuable brand..	5
689	Ive been using this for the last 3 weeks. I decided to write the review on this. The battery and the performance of the phone is extremely awesome. Till this day ive recharged this phone only 4 times. This is what caught my attention first. The camera is not bad, its fine for a price range like this(rear cams). The front cam will take pretty good pictures only at good lighting condition. The low light photography on 5MP front camera is not that appreciable.	4
690	Excellent our purchase.	4
691	I ordered the phone on 26th and was delivered on 27th by Amazon even though it was heavily raining in my city. Full marks for the punctuality and service. I exchanged my year old oneplus X and the phone cost me just 8300/- rupees which is a bargain for this phone.Coming to the phone, the highlight has to be that brilliant display and the form factor in which LG has managed to incorporate it. The phone can easily be operated by only one hand and there are no stutters or screen freeze in normal day to day usage. I am not a heavy user and use it for social networking and media playback and the phone works just fine for my usage. I haven't tried any game but given the processor provided, I think it can handle casual games without breaking a sweat but don't expect to play Asphalt 8 smoothly on this phone though LG has provided a feature where it will tone down the settings of the game to get better frame rates. Rear camera is brilliant in daylight but selfie camera is just about average but has a wide angle mode to incorporate more people into the frame. Also, phone heats up a bit near volume rockers even in general usage but the biggest disappointment has to be the battery life which is just about average for a phone with 3000mAh battery partly due to the screen. It lasts me for almost full day but i have to replug it at the end to maintain some juice in the battery. My oneplus had a smaller capacity battery but was equiped with an AMOLED display due to which battery backup was good as LED panels runs efficiently than LCD.Overall the phone is a head turner due to that display and I couldn't have asked for a better deal from amazon.PS: The built quality is brilliant unlike in the product images uploaded by Amazon. At par with Oneplus and much much better than Samsung's.	4

747	I bought this mobile for my wife.I’m really sorry to say this, Very worst mobile Never see before this kind of such worst mobile...I need to replace this one, can any one pls advise..This mobile comes with lot to of issues.01. Battery drain very fast, less than 4 hrs.02. Getting very heat when data using.03. Network issue, automatically call will cut and another few hrs can’t make any call. Only we can call SOS(emergency).04. Bad camera (both front and back).05. Worst design for ear phone, can’t use more than 30 minuets because of the shape of that. Ear are getting pain if use for long time.	1
748	Such amazing phone. Can't find any cons in this device. I've been intensively using it and honor 8x has left no loopholes in its performance. And notch design and look wise it is unbeatable and such an amazing phone in such affordable price. Go team Honor. Lots of love from your happy buyer. 💙	5

756	Awesome performance but only the thing is battery life. If you are heavy user definitely you need to charge twice in a day	5
757	There is nothing which is shining in this phone compared to its competitors. When I bought this in June 15,2018, it was just in the list of phones which was in my price range. The good phones of xiaomi were either in flash sales or were old. This was the only 19:9 screen phone.The processor is good and can handle games decently. The battery charges quick as much it discharges. The camera is OK particularly the front one. The rear camera feels like it is pasting pictures over the background specially in aperture mode. The speaker quality is OK and on call, the speaker is loud.The headset provided with this one doesn't have any bass and when you are outside noises will disrupt your music experience.	4

780	Windarfull	4
781	Camera quality is awesome both the selfie and rear cameras. Bokeh effects are perfect. Battery life good too after Oreo update.	5
782	Beautiful phone	5
783	The phone is really nice considering all features of Mi phones offering.One thing which is annoying is that they have added ads in almost all default apps(files manager etc)	4
784	Nice phone. Feels good in hand. Touch is too good. Feels a bit slow while multitasking.. camera is good. Full screen display looks awesome..  Sound in speaker is standard, not too good especially because the speaker is at the back. Double tap to wake and sleep is good.Update 1:Tried the face recognition unlock for about 2 hours under the sun, inside a room with dim light and it works like a charm. Loving it.Carrying around in my jeans pocket it does not bulge out. Sleek and comfortable..Update 2:It took me about 45 mins to charge the phone from 32 to 100 percent using my s7 charger. Battery consumption is good, staying idle it drained about 10 percent in 1 hour.. Back cover is made of plastic but does not feel plasticky at all. Sound in headphones is good provided u use your own headphones and not the ones in the box. Selfies are pretty decent.Update 3:The back of the phone is fingerprint magnet, No covers available. Call clarity is good, Reliance JIO and Airtel 4G works like a charm. Battery backup hold good for a day under moderate usage.However charging takes more time, no fast charging options.Update 4:Many people here are complaining about heating issues. Heavy usage of any mid level phone with 4g running is supposed to cause mild heating. After watching hotstar on 4g for about an hour and playing 2 games for about 20 mins i could feel a slight heat on the left side of the device below the volume rocker not something to worry about keeping in mind the fact that this is a mid level phone, conpared to its chinese brothers like MI. Please dont compare the qaulity of lg with MI. The only problem i am facing now is that charging takes almost about 1.5 hours. I listen to music on itunes using 4g on my boat buuetooth speaker from 10 at night and in the morning at 9AM it shows about 25 percent battery drop with Jio working flawlessly.	4
785	This mobile charging is best	4
786	Not so good camera and chipset. Kirin 659 is last year released chipset. Build quality is good.	4

886	After use for one month these morning it fall while taking out from my pocket.the height will be not more than 2 feet. With all screen protector, cover and everything this is happen with so called gorilla glass. Using Xiaomi products from 6 years but these is worst experience. I think they detoriate the quality of product and bit inflate their service prices. Once I reach service center they say 2599 for glass then18% GST and (till that you can understand) but they also ask for 413 rs for replacement charges. I mean for warranty piece at least you can expect that they take screen cost only. I feel that in 1-2 year Xiaomi name will start fading because loyal consumer like us have start having poor experience ( same experience I had with mi3 band). I think it's time to search for quality products rather than buzz created products.	1

895	Honor 8x is a great product with very decent specs.  Its full screen display is fantastic and look pleasant.📷 Camera quality is good. 🔊 I felt the sound to be low sometimes, but not bad.🔋 Battery is too good. You can easily go two days of usage without charging (for average user). For Heavy users it can solidly go for a complete day& more. Build quality is really great at this price. It looks premium.	5
896	Picture quality is not to the mark .. but it's depth effect is excellent, sound is good, it's very handy to use	5

898	After a day of heavy usagePros1. Awesome UI2. Back camera is good3. Handles multi tasking well4. Decent battery life5. Very stylish and premium looking handset some1 from distance might think this as Iphone six.6. No bulky preloaded apps7. Decent Ram management8. Display quality is awesomeCons1. Front camera medicore at this price point2. While using JIO sim phone heats up.3. Screen size is not big as marketing pamplets wants us to believe . The width of phone is as good as Iphone 6. Technically they are correct its 5.5 inch display.4. Needs price correction at 13k.5. Not for intensive gamers.6. Camera filters and options are less compared to peers7. Headset quality and sound OK.	4
899	Costly	4
900	Picture quality is very niceSound quality is very niceBut battery life is very bad, battery working for 11 to 12 hour without playing games.	4
901	The mobile is working awesome. I loved the red colour and it is now available in 6 GB variant which made me purchase this beautiful device. The games are operating smoothly and battery backup is around 10 hours for daily usage. Their is no laginess in the mobile bcz it work on Android one. Camera is the real plus point in this mobile. You will find some true color pictures when you will click.*Please use good quality cover for the mobile because camera bump is quite noticeable and it can bring scratches on the camera. I'm using Spigen cover, which is protecting my A2 like a perfect armour.	5
902	Don't think..the phone runs amazingly fast..also Pubg runs smoother in this phone..it has minor frame drops..but good phone..rear camera performs well but front one is ok	5
903	Best mobile from LG	5
904	When do I get the cash back as I used SBI card for purchase of lg q6 handset	5
905	Apart from little heating issue, it is the perfect phone in its class...value for the money.	5
906	Notch display is not developed well. It's just launched to competition in market for notch display. Notification icons option removed from setting because of not fits in notch display.battery percentage setting also removed.you have to scroll down the status bar to see notifications. And some apps overlaps on notch display contents. If you want to buy this for notch display please stay away. Hoping the update I'll fix it soon. Battery and performs okay. Sounds are very loud. The only drawback is Notch display.	1
907	Trust me I have not experienced even a single glitch while using the phone, it’s been 15 days and the performance of this phone is extraordinary.	5
908	Good picture quality. God mobile in 15k.like iPhone x of midrange smartphone. Good look. Awosm battery life. Vibrant display.	5
909	Front cam pic not so good back camera is ok and battery is average	4
910	Awesome mobile in such a great price nice deal given by Amazon. Thanks a. Lot for it....	5
911	Good battery backup	4
912	Phone is good my review after 2 months1) Battery is good runs for full day considering everthing is setup mails, fb, whatsapp, etc and everything2) charging is slow i have bought mi quick charger but all vain.3) camera is 3.5/5 and you can sense the lag in clicking the pic.4) heavy games will pose issues and it will slow down the mobile.Overall value for money if i eliminate the game experience.	5
913	Picture quality is good,rear cam is good ,front cam is not good in low light,battery lasts 1 to 2 days for moderate users.....overall a good budget mobile	4
914	Good phone for low price. I got exchanged my old phone for best price. Got it delivered at right time.  Thank you amazon	4
915	Missing 3.5 mm jack... battery parfomance very low... missing mamory card slot	1
916	Not a good product. Mobile gets rebooted on its own. Sometime it shows reboot failure. its has not even touched 6 months of life and i am running behind service center.	1
917	Over all this mobile is too good.But the Quality of the back side of this mobile is worst. Because ,with in 15 days of use it scratches so badly and the camera glass also scretch badly. With out back cover you can't even think for use it.Back cover cost also too high and less availability.	3

No call drop or network issues . Camera quality is great. Near stock Android experience. Android pie has been updated. Runs very smoothly. No hang issues or any heating issues till date. Cons: Back is very slippery but the cover provided by mi takes care of this issue. Not for heavy gamers. Battery lasts for 7 t...READ MORE	5
928	Stupid phone. Battery drains fast.. Please do not invest money on this stupid device. There is no option to request a replacement. SMARTCHK application is a crap app which is designed for Amazon and even though the phone temperature is high it says phone working in good condition, no heating issues found. I tried 3 times and go the same result even though the phone was heated....	1
929	After going through  many reviews and considering pros and cons I decided to go for it. I am really happy with the product. Picture quality is superb, sound quality is good. It's run really smooth. I don't mind it to recharge once in a day. Over all I am happy with the product.	5

932	Im writing this after a months use. Except the display everything else is not upto the standard of some other phones in the price bracket of LG Q6. Battery backup is very poor. No fast charging either. Face scan is not quick...fingerprint scanner would have been great. Photos are ok outside...but low light photos are poor. On the whole I would purchase may be Honor 6 or asus models	2
933	The phone i recieved was awful!!!!!!! Mobile was getting heated and picture quilaty is not upto mark 😑😑	1
934	Nice as per values	5
935	Awesome to watch movies in such a big screen. Checked You tube, Netflix and Amazon Prime in full screen and every thing works fine. Not highly comparable to other mobiles with AMOLED displays but still a very decent display at this price point.	5
936	Totally waste of money display fully glaring.back cemeraaa so bad	1
937	The Best part is it's looking is very good,But video clarity is vary bad,In description it is showing it is of 4K,but actually it is not.While playing the video/movies,the clarity of the video seems vary bad.mi A1 is far better than this phone.	3
938	Ear phone, not working without audio jack, and the audio jack I get with phone not working.	3

957	Amazing phone.. using this for one week.. powerful battery that last for 2 days with full on gaming and browsing.. excellent display and specifications with this affordable price range.	5
958	Poor Performance phone with extreme heating, hanging and also issue in making conference call. Support is poor. Nokia's Authorised service centre Noida are ill informed about the phone. According to service centre the recommended heat is 48 degrees but when checked with Nokia chat executive through inbuilt chat facility it is upto 45 degrees. Also I took my phone to Nokia's Authorised service centre Noida to share the concern about the newly purchased Nokia 6.1, after almost 5 hrs of sitting there they gave me ok report and while coming back to home I received few calls and checked the temperature of phone which turned out to be 47degrees. People at service centre are extremely rude to customers. Nokia needs to address both products and services. All the excitement about Nokia comeback went to drain. At present, same day I submitted my Nokia 6.1 2nd time at service centre and is there with them past 4 days. See the loot by Nokia.	1

972	Please dont buy this mobile. It doesn't have latest features available in android..also doesnt have finger print sensor. Face detection doesnt work everytime. Also messaging app also not good. If you buy this mobile then you will trapped and you cant even return this product , amazon will say that return policy not available for this product. Amazon is making you fool by promoting this product	1
973	I think this was perfect	5
974	I am very disappointed with this phone. Picture quality is too worst as compared to redmi note 4. Sound quality good. Phone sometimes hanging and stuckked. In this price range I am expecting more but totally disappointed me. Battery life is good. It's necessary to improve picture quality otherwise it's not a good phone those who are love selfies and pics. Xiomi need to improve camera quality and performance also.Thank you.....	2

983	Very good color. Attractive specs.But battery is kind of okay-ish.Could have put in a 4000mah batter.	5
984	I am so happy this phone	5
985	This is after three day use, Though its 4gb + 64gb but not up to mark, width is not up to mark, phone is not for enjoying videos, App takes time to open not laggs but heavy application take time to operate, Have used J7 prime previous to this for 1.6 years which I feel much smooth and fast than this phone, missing j7 prime. Battery life, music quality and call voice quality is good 25% battery remained even after whole day heavy use; still not very great phone as overall I found a slugish operation.	2
986	All three are best this phone	5
987	A very good phone with very good facility of battery life spanNokia 6+ is better in terms of screen,It has more scree to area ratio.Over all this is good phone	5

990	Overall mobile performance is good, but one thing is to have front camera  pics are not that much quality.	4
991	I brought this phone in exchange offer, and i pay only ₹7824, which is ossum, battery backup is very good, display quality is great with 423ppi, but display is thinner with compare to other phone's displays. Camera is not compatible with display quality, but gives best results in portrait mode. I think camera's quality in this segments phones are almost same. Update improves camera's quality.	4

995	Got this phone only in one day delivery, and i must say that this is an awesome phone. Interface, graphics are much better as i ecpected, and a very smooth touch screen. Very easy to handle bcoz of its compact size n the platinum colour is the best colour amongst all. Camere could have been a bit better, but this thing is covered by the full vision display which realy looks awesome and is the best thing of this phone. Got this phone in just Rs 8200 by exchanging my old lenovo phone. Its a must buy n much much better than oppo, vivo, and mi.Thank u amazon for such a great deal.	5
996	very very slow mobile third class features	1
997	11k for 32gb varient doesn't make any sense..they themselves are selling Redmi y2 with same processor and better front camera at 9k..zenefone max pro m1 with sd636 was available for 9k at flipkart's new year sale	2

1003	In this mobile there is no protection for back camera,And back pouch also not protecting back camera,Earlier I was used MI note 5 pro that has back camera protection by back pouch which is provided by MI,Same like i expected back pouch for MI A2 also but back camera protection not available in MI a2 pouch, even in mobile also...I purchased MI 2 Mobile only because of camera but there is no protection to camera it will be damaged very soon.. so my suggestion is don't buy this camera phone...	1

1023	everything is fine	5
1024	I'd really recommend one to buy this phone. But do have a look at few factors.* Camera : 4/5  There is some problem with the quality of photos taken with the front camera. It doesn't seem like 8 MP camera. But I am sure ASUS will improve it through OTA updates. Coming to rear camera it's performance is pretty good. It's on par with Redmi note 5 pro  (except during low light condition)* Performance : 5/5No words... It's just amazing. We get to see the absolute amazing performance of the...READ MORE	5

1041	The phone is good overall performance is also good but someway lack at built quality and speed ....	4
1042	Extraordinary mobileDiaplay quality is excellent	5
1043	Display: the display is amazing ,there is no problem with sharpness, contrast or colours.everything looks extremly good,sunlight readability is nice.But the on screen navigation button interrupts with feel of 18:9 screen, so i would advice you to install gmd immersive but it too has its own bugs..Performance: yes its not as fast as snapdragon 600 series phones but on day to day usage its fine you will notice lag of 1-2 sec once or twice a day , but that is managable phone does not hang on multitasking ,you can open 4-5 apps at a time.Heating issue: yes phone do heat even on moderate activities.if you are planning to buy this phone you have to live with it.Battery: yes charging is slow,without any fast charging support.battery backup is average,it can last you only for a day but dont expect anything more.Lg UI: good in some areas,but not the best.you will like it after you start using it.Camera: average . i dont click much pictures nor i am a selfie addict.(dont know much exactly)Build quality : excellant .front glass looks beautiful even if that amazing display is off. Sides are strong and stsurdy too. But back is a plastic easily scratched,go for back cover or skin.feels good in hand and do not slip too.Misc:Fingerprint sensor:absentFace recognition: good for show off ,not practicle .works good in good lighting condition.Not meant for dark or low lighting conditionSpeaker : not goodHeadphone jack : niceDedicated sd card slot will come handy in futureHave all the sensorHope you will love the review	4
1044	Writing this review after 5months of use.Camera - awesome best in this rangephone doesn't hang and is smoothly functioning.Only drawback of this phone is a very bad battery system, I mean phone discharge on its own even if u don't do anything.Average battery lasts less than 10 hrs including few hrs of non functioning too.Huawei should work on battery backup rather than boasting about their camera.	3
1045	awesome phone .....nyc	4

1048	Awesome.. Perfect for the mid range price.. Loved it..	5
1049	Best camera for the priceGood perfomanceEven though battery is not that big it manages wellNot so heatingIt's comfy in handOverall happy with the phone	5
1050	Awesome mobile. But very poor screen built quality, screen shattered even with a1 foot fall. Everything else is superb on the phone	4
1051	Quality of Xiaomi has deteriorated with increase in fame...with updates it gets sluggish..	2
1052	Awesome phone,  good battery backup,  no performance lag,  best in class looks,  camera also very good	5
1053	Sound quality didn't meet the expectation's height	5
1054	Considering its price, it's not a very good buy I would say.. inspite of boasting of good cameras, picture quality doesn't come up as exceptional.. scrolling down the gallery is quite troublesome as photos take time to appear.. and if all these seem not quite a big issue then the biggest hindrance is here for you. It has got a charger not with the usual pin like the one most phones have and so either you carry your own charger wherever you go (as you can't borrow anyone's and get your phone charged) or let your phone be switched off in no time.This is my 3rd Motorola phone and it is this time that I am the most dissatisfied.Won't recommend it to anyone as such.	2

1070	"""MI"" ruled always but this time its with a 'PERFECT SIZE' & all the as on date needs (Notch, dual camera, big battery, face unlock & many more...) and all this in just 11k"	5
1071	I have bought this mobile for my daughter on 15.09.2018.  The mobile problem ( hang up) started from 7th of October 2018 itself.  When you want to take a PIC (camara) mobile hangs up .... processsing... which never comes.  We have restarted the mobile several times but the problem persist.  The replacement warranty is there for 10 days only which is the worst. I had bout Lenovo K 3 note which had problem and they replaced the new one even after four months.  But NOKIA is looting the money from customers. We advise that don't purchase NOKIA mobiles.  It is waste of money.....	1

1105	Overall Excellent piece from Mi.. but my personal dislikes are like the camera quality must be improved .. it says 20 mp but if you comparing with samsung then you need to raise the quality of such stuffs. sound quality is ok ok ... battery life is good .. .rest all is good other than these three points.	4

1117	"Amazon and Mi. How did you guys allow a faulty phone get into the market and then put it under replacement warranty for only ""7 days""??!! Its ridiculous. The phone started hanging within one and half months, with the constant need for reboot. After trying everything (soft reset, hard reset, factory reset, repair service centre) it still having the same problem. Was this some horrible plan to ensure your customers start hating the brand. I am not a heavy data or app user. And it still reboots! The time that it worked, there was still a lag but manageable. But after the freezing screen and inability of service center to fix it, Mi- you have disappointed me. Amazon you should relook at the time the phone should be allowed an exchange."	2

1131	Do not buy this phone. It's camera is terribly bad, there are system lags (read the phone hangs) and the battery absolutely does not last a day. Also you know why you should not buy this phone?

1158	Over heating & 0% picture quality.	1
1159	The overall product is good and worth for spending money but the battery life is bad. The 3.5 audio jack is missing though earphones in type c port works pretty well. It noticable that Mi has provided the sound and headphone adjustment. Camera is very amazing. Stock Android you are getting so bloatwares are not there. Lag free performance.	4
1160	loved the product love the brand .. i m using Xiaomi product from the past 6 years so no doubt they r giving u the best in affordable price i think they should work on display  and should refurbish their design  my overall experience to this phone is just awesome	5
1161	very good phone, with exchange my old phone in just 7699 only. thanks Amazon	5
1162	Damaged product	1
1163	Good budget phone with all facilities	4
1164	The Notch...not suitable	5
1165	Picture quality is good,  sound also good	5
1166	Battery life is to short	5
1167	This is a beast of a phone. I was skeptical about buying it because lot of reviewers were saying not to take it and take the redmi note 5 pro instead. But, I went for it because of the positive camera reviews.Pros:-1) Camera. The camera reminded me of my old nokia lumia 525 which had excellent one. Edge detection is teriffic didnt expect this from xiaomi. You can go through some youtube tutorials to use the manual mode and make best use of it.2) stock android is super fluid. I dont like MIUI. No major customisations you get but with android Pie we will get gesture support.3) design is premium. Its got good curves at the edges and feels like holding a oneplus5. Its much better than rn5 pro in terms of design which didnt look premium. It Both devices looks similar from a distance but you will feel the difference once you hold it.4) Speaker Unlike other xiaomi phones its not too loud but it has got a bass which others lack. Good depth sound.5) audio via headphone type C us just mindblowing.7) best processor of SD 600 series lineup8) ram management is superb. OPened 20 apps and none of them reloaded.Cons-1) limited storage might be a concern in future. though google photos have unlimited storage for pics and videos2) there is a bit delay when the phone unlocks after it recognises the finger.3) gets a bit warm after extended gaming4) face unlock doesnt take u to home screen directly.PS-1) dint face any issue regarding proximity sensor during call2) auto brightness sensor is good. I didnt face any issue even its better that redmi note 4 or redmi y1 which i had used earlier where the screen goes very dim in low light making it illegible2) battery is better than what reviewers had said. I get 5hrs of screen on time on moderate usage like playing asphalt 9 for 1 hr, always connected vodafone 4G net. 1 hr of voice calling. navigation through google maps. 2hrs of music and yputube, insta, fb whatsapp etc.3) dont buy a fast charger. With the given charger in box, it charges form 0 to 100 in 1.5hrs.Overall don't go with the reviewers always. its a good phone with great specs which will make performance better in future.	5
1168	Good Product with great features and value for mobey. Good sound and picture quality	4
1169	Good Phone	5
1170	Waste of buying	1

1180	There is a  dark yellowish mark...because of the heating issue. i felt like my mobile is about to explode. Please look for better options.. also this mobile is not acceptable for exchange offers .. please check amazon itself..I don't have any nearby service centers.	1
1181	Grt mobile	5
1182	My honest review: problem with this phone is its processing did not meet up to the mark. Else it's a wonderful product. Has 80000 antutu bench marks. Fcucking  slow phone.I also cannot accept its camera quality back n front both at this price bracket. Few components used in this phone are out dated. And slow. Like camera, processor and micro USB port. No fast charging. Guys pay a little more and get something better. But not thsi.	1
1183	That's good smartphone this bujet	5
1184	Awesome phone.....picture quality Is vary good...everything is just bang . but battery life is just OK .	5
1185	Do not purchase redmi 6 pro not upto the mark . Camera is not good when we zoom the picture it get blurr. instead purchase vivo oppo mobile within same range they will provide good quality with all the feature same and hardware same. I will recommend not to purchase the mobile waste of money.	2

1198	Its good phone in this budger among all the phonws.its has great camera quality and also stock Android is awesome got Android pie update. If they provide more battery then it will be great.	5
1199	I sold the phone worst camera	1
1200	I ordered two phones one is working perfectly but whenever I'm switching off my device it is automatically turning on. So please look to my problem and consider that.	4
1201	I got a phone early, I have ordered Red colour but I have received gold one	4
1202	All function work properly. Low budget good phone	5
1203	After 5 month I found that large application can't function properly.. like WhatsApp , Facebook , massager , camara , YouTube , hot star..  plz hlp out of it..	4
1204	Handy	5
1205	The best of its.kind, best camera	5
1206	1.Awesome display2.Strong build except the plastic back which is sticky and get scratches easily3.People complaints about face recognition i didn't find it that inaccurate.works fine4.Old chip set but still rocks5.Decent camera both front and rear6.One star less just because it lacks fingerprint sensor and notification led	4
1207	Display is amazing ....poor front and back camera ....no notification led ....	2
1208	I ordered red colour and it's beautiful. Picture quality is also good. Front camera also takes decent pics. Fits in my palm. Plastic back cover is also given.	5
1209	Using Mi A2 since last two weeksCamera dual is awesome don't compare with any other phone it's camera is really mind blowing.Front camera also good.Performance also good .Look design also good.Battery life is normal with 3000 mh you will not find any issue if you are not a heavy gamer. Also this phone is with quick charging it will take around 55 minutes from 0 to 100 % battery.I could have given 5 star if phone comes with quick charger. Over all good phone with stock android	4
1210	After using 2 day i found honor done a great work with their honor 8x phone.When you hold the phone it feel like premium phone in 15k price point.Everyone told about  it's  sound problem, but i want told them that you guys use phone like home theater? Guys believe  me honor 8x have good earphones  as well as main speaker. Guys believe go for this device.	5
1211	It is good but camera should be better	4
1212	Build quality is fantastically heavy. Sound is also loud and can hear every single bass sound tracks. Only problem is while watching videos in YouTube the video does not support full resolutions. It can only zoom to certain extent.which is not satisfying. Camera quality is not that good but still can take some decent photos. The Xiaomi UI really sucks and the MI apps keeps troubling a lot.	5
1213	I like it.	5
1214	This is awesome mobile . Sound quality and camera quality and big screen display	4
1215	Very smooth	4
1216	Writing review after using a month.Picture quality- 3.5/5 (Mi A1 was having great picture quality despite of 12+12 camera)Battery life- 3/5Performance- 4.5/5Display- 5/5Design- 4.5/5Overall a great experience having mi A2	4

1234	1. Camera : Quality is good in all conditions2. Memory : Having a 64 GB of internal storage and speed of opening and closing the app is good3. Feature : Having all latest feature with the finger print scanner4. Lots of inbuilt app5. Battery life: by using the wifi, internet and app the battery life is around 48 hrs last long	5
1235	WASTE total waste buy any other smart phone at this cost	3
1236	redmi 6 pro looking so beautifull and i like this android version	5
1237	I was surprised by the packing and got confused if this is new or refurbished,Then checked it on the youtube they all are getting the same packing. It is sealed pack with one sticker not packed with the polythene.And the phone inside was also in a thing which I did not expected.So do not get confused by the packing.Performance is something I cannot say a word about.It is that good.Looks is decent.Go with the black one as blue one is looking odd as it is black from front.Display is good enoughCamera does not have any image stabelization so for clicking best pic from it you need to be steady well.Other wise camera is good enoughNight mode is not that good.Did not try the slow motion.Battery is good enough but charges slow.Expected a lot by the reviews but got disappointed.SO DO NOT EXPECT MORE	3
1238	Good mobile ,(good looking,good Picture quality,and battery life is too good)	5
1239	My honor 8x display is blurring and I surprise to see the video quality is like 8k to 10k rs cost mobile. I am very disappointed. I am currently using Honor 7x and it's a perfect phone. I expected the Honor 8x will keep the quality as Honor 7x. I think I received a defected phone. Anyway i have requested to replace the phone, and it's processing(after 4 days, nobody came to pickup the phone). I hope that I will get the perfect phone when it's replacing.	1

1290	The Redmi 6 pro is among the best mobiles you can buy at this price range. Let me put down some of the pro's and con's of this mobile.Pros1. Value for money.2. Good design and build quality. Size is perfect.3. Rear camera is good, its the same setup as in Redmi note 5 pro.4. FHD screen with notch display5. Good battery life and no heating issues.6. Face recognition + fingerprint login7. Dedicated micro SD card slot. You can have 2 micro sims and an SD card.Cons.1. The front camera is just average and its bad in low light conditions .2. Snapdragon 625 is a bit old now, it's been around a while.3. Nothing much new apart from the notch display in this phone. So if you're not a fan of notch display, then you can ignore it.4. Not meant for high intensity graphic games. I don't play games but I tested PUBG and it was below average.5. I'm not fan of MIUI. Too many advertisements and its another revenue model for Xiaomi. The company has admitted  its one way to reduce the cost of Mi phones.6. Same old micro USB port, no type C. Its fine since you don't see type C port at this price range.7. Face unlock is average, it works only with good lightingOverall I found Redmi 6 pro a very good phone. As I've mentioned earlier there is nothing much new apart from the notch display when compared to other Mi phones.	5
1291	Best design , best camera ,best battery , best performance , outstanding mobile by redmi 6 pro . only earphones quality are normal	5
1292	Everything about this phone is upto the mark, only thing i see as downside is the SoC.	5
1293	It is a very nice product...	4
1294	Super mobile	4
1295	Not a value for money , moto is looting the money in broad day light , design is good , music player crashes every time when u go back ground .. an average phone it is , but not at the cost of 17 k & all.. bad experience with it .. go for MI phones.. they are just very good compared to it & value for money also ..feed back & support are worst .. one of the worst phone by Moto	3
1296	screen mirroring or cast screen not available,auto focus poor, and no led indicator light,no fingerprint given otherwise excellent phone	3
1297	low cost and so many features	5
1298	PERFECT	5
1299	Type c Charger only failed,,and all thing is very good norting to talk other features	4
1300	Edit on Nov 28,2017: Well, while the phone is good, software is buggy. My phone got bricked twice for no reason. I would ask people to skip phones from LG and choose from Xiaomi or Honor.I've got this phone for INR 8500+ after exchange and Cash Back deals, which is super great deal (Thank you Amazon). I've been a user of Honor and Xiaomi, two brands I am loyal to. But loved LG G6 when I checked at a showroom. When LG announced that it would bring FullVision Display to the masses, I was waiting to buy this one and ordered immediately when became available. Been a Xiaomi/Honor fan, was I impressed? Kind of!Physique: This phone looks pretty in hand and very well built. The tall display design is the future all Brands will copy it. Samsung and LG are pioneers in this design. Full marks to  LG for making a standalone design.Internals : Some may concerns about low end processor but in my opinion, it doesn't matter for a usual consumer whats inside; It's all about user experience. LG really did a god job here.Camera : I have  not taken much pics.. I will know in a few days. [ Edit on Aug 15, 2017 ]: Rear camera is actually good but the camera app lacks features (I'm comparing Xiaomi phones here). Front cam is bit disappointing, in my opinion.Battery and heating : Not sure yet.. But looks like it's not that stellar.. [ Edit on Aug 15, 2017 ]:  Battery is not that great. This phone holds full charge just for  12- 15 hours.. I had to customize a lot to reduce battery consumption. Comparing to Honor phones, it doesn't do a good job in battery optimizationCons : No finger print reader could be a biggest miss for some. I will test for some time and update if I find anything else.	1

Amazon people was very cooperative to replace the handset even after the expiry of return period. But the replaced one also has the same problem.Got fed up and didn't refer it back to Amazon.Its surprising how a brand like Moto can produce such crap.	2

1421	Decent smartphone with decent speed,camera	5
1422	It's been 2 and half months I have bought this phone.I will tell you what all are the difficulties I am facing.First of all the back panel is so prone to scratch that even from the first day it will start getting scratched.As of now mine back panel looks like one year old phone.And the most important heating issue,As soon as you open the camera the heating increases abnormally such extent that you won't be able to hold the phone in your hand comfortably.No fingerprint scanner and the face recognition doesn't work at all.	1

1448	Bought it on launch dat i.e. 10th August. Enjoy every bit of this complete package.Pros:1. Killer looks2. Build quality3. Ease of handling due to narrow bezels4. UI is nothing less than best brands5. Battery backup to my surprize is whole day  even with moderate use.Cons:1. Processor could have been SD 600 series.  Though I haven't faced any issue bcoz I never  play games.2. LED notifications should have been provided.3. Fast charging option not there. It takes about  2 hours to charge from nil to 100%.4. Camera is nothing extra- ordinary. In day light  it does the job fairly.If you are not a heavy gamer and handling, look n solid feel is your priority then you have just seen the right review. Go grab your color choice in light on pocket price, specially during sale season.	5
1449	Headset is of poor quality. Very noisy.	4

1455	battery life is superb....picture quality is poor... sound qualit is below avg.....	3
1456	Nice mobile very comfortable.	5
1457	Superb phoneCamera is very good 4.5/5 SLR qualityDisplay very good (beautiful notch) 5/5Battery life is very (1.5 half day long time battery internet on) internet off battery time 3 days more	5
1458	Amazing product truely value for money compare to iPhone varients., slightly getting heat when your use through  video call	5
1459	It is an excellent phone, providing or delivering extra with everything thing you would want in a under 15k price category. However, to my utter disappointment one of the basic stuff of fast charging is not working with my Turbocharger and it takes ages to reach 100 %. As usual nobody bothers to listen to pleas to replace accessories at service centres. Do not know what to do? It still not 2 months old yet	4
1460	Camera quality is very bad.....	3
1461	Great mobile. Great camera quality great sound quality great futchers	5
1462	Good Buy	4
1463	I love this mobile very very very very nice good and selfie modes are better than oppo and vivo.Buy only	5
1464	The phone is nice. Was disappointed that it still comes with the july security patch.	4
1465	Camera has stopped working automatically, Even Amazon not helping, saying a word 'contact with manufacturer'. Why always customer struggle.	1
1466	All are good in this phone but the problm is battery drains very fst	1
1467	Battery life is decent , easily lasts for one day	3
1468	All is well	5
1469	I enjoy using it. Versatile and user friendly. Gives good performance.	5
1470	There are so many their own apps which are not even required. They are forcing us to use their apps only instead of standard google apps. We cannot even remove them and disable them. It will eat up your mobile battery. Why do they provide their own apps if there are apps available from google? Do they think they can developed better apps than google? A big joke!!! I'll never buy any Xiomi phone again in my life.	1
1471	Worth for money..	5
1472	Phone is not working properly.. sound quality is worst. Cannot hear anythng. Disappointed	1
1473	Guys It's Really an Awesome PHONE......Love it.....It's Android, screen,even I use It's camera to make my you tube videos...it's really up yo the marks....though it have some issues on its selfie camera..But i just like it.	5
1474	I bought the Redmi 6 pro 3/32gb variant (Blue color) for Rs 6902/- (After exchange of my 2.5 yr old letv le 1s for ₹3330/- (additional 1000 off on exchange) + 10% instant discount on debit card) & following are my observations.In the box:- Handset with built in battery.- Power brick. (5v, 2A)- USB to micro USB cable. (0.8 m)- Information leaflets.- TPU protective case. (Clear transparent for this colour)- Sim tray ejector pin.~~~~~~~DISPLAY~~~~~~~It comes with a full HD+ IPS LCD resolution display (2280x1080) with a pixel density of 432 ppi and is bright enough to look under direct sunlight. The viewing angles could have been a little bit better.Comes with a notch display with a 19:9 aspect ratio & it completely hides the notch while viewing videos though the bottom has rounded corners and the top has square once so it is a bit asymmetrical to view while watching videos (case with most phones with a notch but can be easily fixed with a software update).Also when using apps like Netflix the maximum resolution which can be streamed is SD which is a bit of a shame since the display is a full HDRATING - 4.5/5~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~BUILD QUALITY & PERFORMANCE~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~PROS:-👍 Build is good at this price. It has design like other xiaomi phones of 2018. Metal body with top and bottom made of plastic for the antennas. Yr👍 Sturdy built and no flex, prefer metal back to the more fragile and fingerprint prone glass back (Nokia 5.1 Plus, honour 9n and 9 Lite) as well as polycarbonate backs (realMe 2, infinix note 5). This is a personal opinion.👍 Fingerprint Sensor is accurate & does the job, fast enough. Placement on the back where it is easily reachable. Has Face Unlock too which works well in brightly lit conditions however in dim light conditions it's better to go with fingerprint scanner.👍 Compact form factor and easily usable with a single hand. This is a big plus for those looking for compact phones as the options are very limited with increasing screen sizes.👍 Has a dedicated microSD slot along with two slots for nano sim. Can pop in a MicroSD card upto 256 GB👍 Supports the 5Ghz WiFi band (AC) too which is good in this price segment.👍 Comes with all the imp sensors (Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass). Generally in this price segment reputed companies like Samsung have been known to emit some imp sensor to cut costs.👍 MIUI is a very customisable OS. You get features like twin apps and this UI gives a good battery Life also (more on battery life in a separate section)👍 Has IR blaster. Good that xiaomi continues to give this feature in the budget range and it's a handy little featureCONS:-👎 Has a single firing bottom speaker which is strictly average.👎 Does not support dual VoLTE meaning you cannot use two jio Sims at the same time.👎 Though one can play high end games like pubg but you won't be able to enjoy the graphics of the game. There are better options for Gamers in this price segment like Nokia 5.1 Plus or even Asus zenfone Max Pro M1.👎 Has considerable amount of chin as well as side bezels.👎 For a compact form factor it feels a bit heavy. Same weight as Asus zenfone Max Pro M1RATING - 4/5~~~~~~~BATTERY~~~~~~~Comes with a non removable 4000 mAh battery which gives a very good battery life thanks to the battery friendly Snapdragon 625 SoC and a battery friendly MIUI. Lasts 1.5-2 days under a single charge.This phone does not support quick charge and the power brick supplied has a rating of 5V, 2A which is standard for the phones in this price segment (only infinix note 5 comes with a fast charger in the box).Takes about 3 hours to charge from 0 to 100%.RATING - 5/5~~~~~~CAMERA~~~~~~Comes with a dual camera setup.12+5 MP, f/2.2 for both. The primary camera has large 1.25 Micron pixel size which on paper gets better low light performance. Camera performance is good under well lit conditions but struggles under low light. Secondary depth sensor helps in attaining good portrait shots. Rear camera setup is same as in redmi Y2 and MI Max 3. Capable of recording videos @1080p at 30 fps. Sadly 60fps is not present at the moment. Has EIS support which is a good thing.Front shooter is  5 mp and is below average in comparison to the phones available in this price segmentRATING - 4/5=======VERDICT=======CONSIDER THIS PHONE IF:You want a compact phone with a very good battery life and a good quality screen with a processor which can handle day to day tasks and light gaming.SKIP THIS PHONE IF:- You are a gamer. Nokia 5.1 plus with helio p60 is the best option in this price segment for Gamers as well as Asus zenfone Max Pro M1 is better than Redmi 6 pro with Snapdragon 636.- You are a person who clicks a lot of pictures from their smartphone. Honestly in this price segment the camera quality is average for all the phones however in the festive season sales you can go for upper mid range phones which are available for a discounted price. At the time of writing this review the Moto x4 is available for 11k which in my opinion has a better camera than all these 10-11k phonesI had considered the following phones also which you can also have a look at before finalizing your decision:- Nokia 5.1 Plus. Average battery life is the reason I didn't go for this phone otherwise it's very good. Comes under Android one program which provides faster updates, USB type C port and looks gorgeous. 720p screen is not a deal breaker for me.- Realme 1 and realme 2. Honestly after using Oppo F7 I don't like colour OS at all. I feel it is a mix between IOS and Android.- Asus zenfone Max Pro M1 (3+32). I don't feel there is any flaw in this phone for this price segment but I simply went for redmi 6 Pro as I was getting a better exchange value for my old phone. I think Asus zenfone Max Pro M1 is the best overall phone currently for this price segment of 10 to 11k.- Redmi note 5 Pro. Available for discounted price in this festive sale - 13k which is the same price as the 4GB ram variant of this phone. It has a better set of camera sensors, better processor in Snapdragon 636 and a notch less display.If you have any other doubts not covered by this review then use the comments section below and i'll get back to you	5

1498	Pls dont buy it. Horrible battery life, scary sound volume, issues with screen brightness.	1
1499	when you first look the phone it seems very pretty but performance wise i don't like this phone.1 the 5 megapixel front camera for selfies is a tiny bit unsatisfactory and leaves it for improvement.2 even though you may not find any particular heating issues, it may seem that the redmi 6 pro stutters slightly while playing heavy games.3 it does not support fast charging.4 face unlock works efficiently in low light which is a significant security concern since anyone maybe capable of unlocking your phone.5 Weight wise 178gm which is slightly heavy as compared to other phone in the same price range and of same battery size.One thing i really like and appreciate mi for notification light. i love that notification light.	2
1500	Camera is the best part of this phone. Everything is fine except battery. If you're a heavy user don't go for it.	4
1501	Screen is very sharp nd crispyOther feutures like camera etc are so so...	3
1502	Camera is not good...especially the front camera..Heating issue is there....Light user...so performance is okay i guess...Overall phone is okay...Now there are other phones available with better features within this price suggest....	3

1523	Good Product	5
1524	Although the product looks good in many ways, it is very hard to use it daily and especially for people who use roughly, it is not recommended.I'm writing only the cons which I observed after use of 5 days.Bugs are there.1. I observed bugs when I dragged and dropped an application icon to main screen. After I moved the application icon to a different place in the main screen, I could see two icons for the same application. Although the application was not opening on the one icon, this was automatically vanished after restart.2.  I could see battery was showing charging even after I unplugged from charger. This was resolved after restart.3. Very delicate back body. It is very slippery as well and can easily fall down if you don't have a firm grip.4. Once it fall down from my hand and it got broken. seems it is made of glass. Not recommended for users without a firm grip back case.5. Although i had a tempered glass, it was broken too after i was fallen from my hand.This product is NOT recommended.	2
1525	Not recommend... Not good product.. I m usibg it about 2 months.. Bt not satisfied	3
1526	I like the smoothness of phone running smoothly but the phone's whight is not good very heavy	4
1527	I received the mobile. Unpacked it to find out there is no standard battery charge available on the phone. The phone was completely dead. Charged it and started using it. The Camera was good but the battery started to drain even when phone not in use. This is unacceptable. So I am returning the phone. I have ordered another phone.	1
1528	Camera is not so good. Touch quality not impressive.	3
1529	Good battery, sound, camera. I like the latest mi version	5
1530	Overall it is Very Good phone no lags, good bettry, display, nice disign and UI.	5

1572	Honor 8x is a value for money product you can simply go for it!!	5
1573	For given proce you are getting a great camera phone capable of some great low light photography and I am guessing there is lot of space wasted inside phone as it has battery of only 3000 mah so i guess a headphone jack could easily be adjusted in this phone.Battery life is not that great if you consider the price point but it gets the work done. Sound quality is better for the given price I mean better than honor play and real me 2pro. I know that honor play has last generation flagship processor but when it comes to sound quality that it does not do the justice with the price. And it's camera is not upto the mark let's be honest honor made that phone for sole purpose that is gaming it is targeting users who play a lot of game.Thankyou	4
1574	nice mobile ..but when it is upgraded to pie ..some problems happened but now it is fixed ..cool mobile and ur service was very goodREAD MORE	4
1575	Overall good mobile	5
1576	overall mi a2 is a best phone but i am not suggested for long time users because its battery 3010 mah is not sufficient.Apart from battery,its a value for money phone in this magical range (Rs16999).I think at the time of lauch this set no one compair it, at same price.its snapdragon 660 processor works very well.i use this phone near about 1 month and did not find any lagg or disadvande except battery life..i hope my opinion is useful to clear picture about mi a2,so that you easily make decision buy or not.(and also know it memory is fixed because card slot is not there.)	4
1577	Nice performance	5
1578	Overall a good phone to use with great display, good camera, and compact design but only stupid thing in it is the plastic back of the phone.  It catches a lot of scratches even while cleaning with a soft cloth or just by putting a trnsparent jelly cover on it. Very stupid step taken by LG while making it.	4

1599	Everything is good but camera must be improve.	4
1600	Good phone with moderate camera quality.	3
1601	The first few days the phone was good and then all the issues started to crop up.  The phone stopped working in one month and the Mi service replaced the motherboard.  After changing the motherboard and re-installing the applications the battery is giving weird experience.  The top battery percentage shows 100%; whereas when I got to battery app it shows 46%.  The phone at times doesn't get charged even though the battery icon changes to charging mode.  The google maps software when in directions mode freezes when we got a call (while driving).  Xiaomi doesn't have any support to report bugs on software, the chat agent asked me to drop to the nearest service centre to re-image the phone.  The only good feature of the phone is its camera other than that I don't recommend this phone.	1

1608	Picture quality most battery life is poor	5
1609	Battery drain high despite latest update.	2
1610	Right from the beginning the set is not functioning  properly.The issues are:1. Calls do not go through many times even when the signal strength is very good.2. Contact numbers are getting jumbled up / mixed up with other contacts3. Either the mike or speaker stop functioning / erratic. Either my voice is not heard on other side or other side could not be heard.Amazon has disowned responsibility so also Nokia.This was complained to Amazon, but of no help. I have lost confidence in both Amazon & Nokia. If the product is not replaced, legal action will be initiated	1

1637	A bit on a heavier side, feels quite big for a single hand usage..Heating issues initially which is now sorted over subsequent android security updates..Camera is amazing in day light, enough for non detailing purpose or mobile photography..Performance is quite good not as bad as seen in reviews, even the fingerprint touch is quick.Bought this for 11,600₹,13,999₹ -1,399₹ (10%) -1,000 (cashback)4gb/64gb variant is good with the performance and the metallic colour n all metal unibody!Was hesitant initially looking at the reviews but when actually put in use for few days, doesn’t feel as bad as the reviews seen!There are lots of other portals with complete reviews and videos.Everyone has their own needs and expectations, this suited mine..Notch and bezel less design, I’m afraid I would break it easily so I went for this model...	4

1655	Amazon Delivery sarvice is very very very bad but fon look great I am so happy	5
1656	Cost is high. They have modified redmi note 6 pro's camera shape and selling it in the name of Mi A2 and battery is worst. Camera alone is good. MI A2 is just worth for Rs.12k range . Moto One power and Redmi Note 6 pro are better. Even Huawei competitors are better. I bought it for Rs.16k on Jan 03,2019 and today Xiaomi is announcing its original price at Rs.14k . #MI - THE WORST CHINESE BRAND#	1
1657	I bought this phone 8 months ago.biggest reason was its display .but after few days I came to find that display is yellowish and all imagery is like oil painting.(It took few days to notice because phone was for my brother.and he had it for all the time.I was out of the town .and when I noticed,I waited for lg updates!).but I couldn't do nothing.because it can be replaceable only in 10 days.but,I have been seeing my products in order list and I thought writing review could be good for others.may be,it is just faulted one &others are good.but you have to think twice.and..Amazon&lg guys.I always appreciate your genuiness towards customers.I know,now its not ur duty to fix it bcoz limit of 10 days have gone.but still u can take this feedback positively.	2
1658	I am statisfy with this phone	5
1659	Very good performance.	5
1660	Great phone and nice display with prefect touch response. No fingerprint scanner but face recognition is there but it won't work in night time and day time also its response is very poor	5
1661	Can't describe the feeling I am going through while writing this feedback. Just one word to describe it - WOW!!	5
1662	The product is good it's picture quality is also good	5
1663	Not working smoothly	3
1664	Good looking phone	5
1665	RAM is not upto the level. Always the RAM free space is showing below 900MB. Phone itself occupied more than 3 GB. Camera quality is average in low light.	3
1666	Good Phone......But not much.....!!!!Pros1. Display Awsome2. No Hybrid Sim Slot3. Bottom Side Key, is in dispaly, So Display is 5.5Inch but you can use 5.2Inch display,4. Touch Good5. Mobile Handling Grip GoodCons1. 14 K Budget only 3GB Ram, All Mobile Manufacturer Provide 4GB Ram in this Range2. 14K Budget, 1.4 GHz processor while other manufacture provide 2.0 GHz Processor, So Little Bit Display3. Bettery Optimization not so good4. Worst Camera, Camera is Like Remi 4A, 5K phone6. Back Cover too Shiny7. LG....GUI is not so goodFor this Price Range....It's not wothful.....You can go for another option Honor 6X, MI A1....	3
1667	1.  It is a good budget phone in 11k, the main part is excellent battery life, camera is ok not so bad and good too, but the miui features are always great than stock android, built quality is also good#. MAIN POINT IS IT SUPPORT DEDICATED MICRO SD CARD SO GO FOR 11K 32 GB VARIENT IT IS VALUE FOR MONEY, DONT GO FOR 13 K 64 GB VARIENT IT IS NOT VALUE FOR MONEY INSTEAD OF THAT U CAN GOR NOTE 5 PRO FOR 15K2.  Not support fast charging, but charging speed is also good not so bad at 5 volt 2 amp. We can say its semi fast charging technolodgy and it is good.3.  some featues like full screen gestures are too good, this is miui 10 features but you can get in miui9 in redmi 6 pro.4.bottom speaker is ok not too good as well as bad but the earphone speaker is great,5. Does not supprt dual volte but that was not a big issue i use gio sim for volte so that was not a big issue for me,6. Back camera is good, in front u can get a 5 mg pixel camera but friends you get 4000 ml amp battery and miui so it was great. camera is not a big point for me i preffer features first. but i didnt said camera is bad, its ok7. Built quality is excellent, it feals so stylish in hand8. Processor is 2 years old realeased snapdragon 625 wich not bad in my opinion at this price.( I MEAN ONLY IN 11K PRICE NOT FOR 13 K)9.face unlock is also ggod fingerprint scanner is too goodOk at last i want to say it is very good phone in 11k for those who are looking for a battery and feature of miui. (Not for 13k 64gb Varient it is not value for money).	4
1668	Camera is working a bit slow after some months. Messages dont get deleted even after deleting once due to some bug.	4
1669	Overall good product... Value for money.	4
1670	Working fine given the price range	5
1671	Love the smartphone as we know xiomi provides the best they can provide and the main highlight of the set is its display and the design which gives an immense touch of satisfaction and quite happy with the camera	5
1672	WorseI don't know who fault hereAmazon or MIFirst recieved phone having display light colour problemNetwork issueAmazon even reject to replaceLeave the refundUse flipkart not this	1
1673	Camera is awesome.	5
1674	I didn't load extra apps, although often it hangs over.	1
1675	I have purchased this phone by seeing the reviews and specs. I have ordered the phone on 28th May and amazon delivered the phone on 29th May. After three days of usage on 3rd June the phone suddenly powered off in between call and even after putting charged for 1 hr it failed to power on. Poor quality and and it very delicate. I have returned the phone and thanks to amazon for returning my money.	1
1676	nice phone in this time lg 1st time in amazon	5
1677	ProsGood displayBattery backup is goodFast ChargingNegTerrible weightSelfe camera is Bad Quality.Only one color Notification for notificationNo Type-CPreviously i had Redmi 3 S prime and it's awesome so I purchased this on the first day ..Overall is not satisfactory. Expected a good product from Redmi	2
1678	Not so good .i think real me 2 is better than its in शामे price sagment	3
1679	Look is osam ..... And display is very good.... Appearance is like premium fons... But weak battery ..... Noise in speakers... Bad front camera.... Overall good.... Depends on your requirements	3
1680	Awesome... Value for bucks	5
1681	Nice work	5
1682	A note to people who buy Moto phones based on the brandDon't expect the quality that Moto had provided earlier.You will get as many complaints as you can get.The phone get switched off automatically/ or restarts automatically.(given twice to fix the issue but the service center couldn't do anything. I still have this issue)You will not get it replaced after 7 days of purchase.The sound quality is good when you play songs, but your earpiece doesn't work well when you make a call.Buy this if if can take risk.	1
1683	Hey guys this is TECHBORED! and this is unboxing and also will adding some camera shots.-----------------------IN THE BOX-----------------------1. Manuals with warranty information.2. Charging cable.3. 5V 2A power adapter.4. Transparent TPU case.5. Redmi 6 Pro.----------DESIGN----------1. The transparent case fits well and is a perfect fit. Gives nice feel in hands.2. It comes with a notch that is small and I really liked it, At least Xiaomi has tried to cut out the bezels at this budget segment.3. It sports a FULL HD + display with that 19:9 aspect ratio.4. On the top of the phone there is this infrared sensor secondary noise cancellation microphone and wow there is this 3.5mm headphone jack. Always happy to see this port.5. Now moving to the button than there is this micro USB port situated with microphone and the speaker that is loud but decent sounding speaker.6. Redmi 6 Pro body is made up of both metal and plastic. So this is only where metal is used but on the top bottom and on the sides it is plastic. Also the sim tray is made up of plastic. Buttons are made up of metal thats nice and gives very nice feedback.----------------------------DUAL 4G STANDBY----------------------------There is DUAL SIM with dual 4G standby so you can use both sims on 4G at same time. And here is agood thing that I liked about this and it is that it has dedicated Micro SD card slot.---------------------------FACE UNLOCK---------------------------There is also the finger print sensor that is fast enough to unlock and it also come with this face unlock that is pretty fast and I think it is very much secure. At least it will not be unlocked with your pictures.-----------------------CAMERA SETUP-----------------------1. The best thing that Xiaomi has put in to this Redmi 6 Pro and it is the same camera setup as on Redmi Note 5 Pro. So it has 12Mp with 5mp dual camera setup with aperture of 2.2 and the single LED flash in the middle. Just now I cannot tell in detail that how how camera performs but I have included some shots that are taken on Redmi 6 Pro and I think they are nice, decent and are almost the the same as on Redmi Note 5 Pro.2. This camera setup can record upto 1080p videos at 30fps and it supports EIS and the videos are not much shaky and EIS performs well. Where as on the front is 5MP with aperture of 2.0 camera and its decent.-------------------HARDWARE-------------------1. So it is powered with the same old Snaprdragon 625 and I think think that it is good for the budget smartphones for now and it performs well on this smartphone.2. Redmi 6 Pro is backed up with 4000mAh battery that is great.3. Running on Android 8.1 Oreo and on the top of that there is custom MIUI 9. It will soon get a stable update of MIUI10.4. So the Redmi 6 pro comes in 3GB RAM with 32GB internal mermory and 4GB RAM with 64 GB internal memory variants.	5
1684	The taken picture is good when we see without zooming...	4
1685	Very nice product	5
1686	Picture quality is good.look wise attractive.	4
1687	Product is good but please don't sell through amazon	5
1688	First the look and feel and it is awesome,very easy to grip and for notch display it looks premium.Camera:it s better than note 4 and note 5.low light photo graph is better. But there is no front flash.Sound is very premium not loud but when it is with a headset it blast its very good in that.Battery:it is carried out since note 4 it has huge battery life and last more than a day if used normally,but battery saver mode last for 3 days or more, it is a budget and yet very stylish phone.	5
1689	Have been using this for a month. Very much satisfied.	4
1690	Nice product thanks amazon....	5
1691	Phone box doesn't contain earphones	5
1692	The product was good.	5
1693	Very nice.	4
1694	This phone has a sleek unibody design made of metal for the most part. It kind of looks similar to an iPhone but feels better than an iPhone in hands (I was an iPhone user). It's really slim, and you need a case to protect the bumpy camera at the back. Though xiaomi claims it has antislip finish, it is better to use it with a case because it is really slim and it can easily slip through your hands at times.I noticed there are literally hundreds if not thousands of reviews on this phone. So in this review I will stick to common issues that many people keep complaining about in this review.Battery lifeYes, it has a 3010 mAh battery and that sounds bad on papers, but on day to day use I find it to be more than sufficient. I am not a gamer, and I do not sit in front of my mobile all day long. I mostly use the phone for WhatsApp, reading through news, and love to spend an hour or so on social media. With my usage pattern I mostly end up having more than 40% battery left at the end of the day. Obviously, this will vary from person to person.Having said that, there are ways through which you can get more juice out of this device.1. You need to switch off vibration on keystroke (it takes up a considerable charge if you text a lot)2. Switch off automatic bluetooth and WiFi detection (This means your phone is keep looking for WiFi and Bluetooth signals around even when you have switched off Bluetooth and WiFi.)3. Turn off adaptive brightness (Its easy to change your brightness manually)4. Turn off Auto-rotate (Many users noticed a considerable boost in their android devices after switching it off)5. Turn off location service. I found the phone automatically detecting my location when I first started using it. Then used Google assistant to turn off the location and found a decent boost in battery retention.6. Turn off WiFi if you use mobile data and vice versa (most people have the habit of leaving both turned on and this can drastically drain your battery)Making these four changes you will notice a considerable improvement in your battery life.Display BrightnessAnother huge complaint on this device is the display brightness and it is true that it is not the best display in terms of brightness. However, for indoor use the display brightness is more than sufficient. You will need to keep the brightness level to over 85% for outdoor use and it is not bad outdoors as well. It is pretty much usable in sunlight.Key thing is turn off the adaptive brightness and set it manually to your needs, because I find adaptive brightness in this device is not doing a good job and it leaves the brightness levels pretty low on most occasions.Gaming performanceThis is a decent gamer device, but you need to know this phone is not designed for gamers, if you are hardcore gamer and loves to play games all day long, this is not the device for you. I guess Honor play would be the best choice in this case. Having said that, its gaming performance is not that bad, in fact it plays graphically intense games pretty smoothly but that is going to come at the cost of draining your battery very rapidly.Most people who complain about battery life on this device are most likely the ones who play games lot. Let me make it clear this is not a gaming device.Camera PerformanceThis is where the phone really shines. Both the front and rear facing cameras a really good, it is on power with many of the flagship phones from other manufacturers. I compared some of its shots with iPhone 8 and I must say its picture quality is comparable to iPhone 8 or little better than iPhone 8.Video recording is decent as well and stabilization is really good in 1080p. However, stabilization takes a beating when you start to record on 4K. Video quality should suffice your normal needs.SoftwareOne of the main reasons I purchased this phone is because of its pure vanilla android software. It doesn't have a prebuilt skin or custom UI over android, and do not come with many bloatware as well. It has some pre-installed mi-apps which can be uninstalled if needed. With two years of promised Android updates, you cannot ask for more when it comes to software.If you love pure android user interface then this phone takes the cake in that department.Not to forget Xiaomi recently pushed Android Pie update for the device.DrawbacksSome of the frequently mentioned drawbacks of this device are lack of headphone jack and support for microSD card slot.In the box you will have a USB-C to audio out adapter, which you can attach to your headphones. A little compromise you need to make for having a USB-C port. I am not a headphone user, so I did not find it limiting. However, a headphone jack would still be nice.Phone comes with 64 GB of internal storage, around 13% of the storage is occupied by system files and pre-intalled softwares and apps. So you will have around 46 GB of storage space which you can use out of the box. Practically, this should suffice most of your storage needs. Not to mention you can backup unlimited photos and videos to Google and access them anytime you like and free up majority of your storage space.Again lack of microSD card slot is not a deal breaker for me.ConclusionOverall I love this phone as my daily driver and I will also recommend it to some of my friends as well. This is a great phone if you are not into games and love to capture high detailed pictures effortlessly. Camera is just awesome on this device.Hope you find the review useful. If you have any questions feel free to reply and I will answer in my free time.	5

I bought this phone with a list of expectations.The reality is,Full display * it's new experience = good but not Cristal clear like Samsung and redmiBattery* fast charging = but no whole Day back up ( I'm a normal user)Body * it's build with solid metal frame, but back cover is disturbing with easy scratches= really it's body is cute and handy with 5"" displayNetwork * avarageHeating* if you are a heay user it will distrib you with heatCamera * results recal VGA camera phonesPerformance * more than avarageSound * good clarity but for videos you have to use head phonesOverall * price not meet quality. LG should improve,"	3

1783	Pros:Writing it after 3 months of usage..Good screen ..good to hold in your hand..will not able to use full of screen because of its proposition.

Cos same cam when i used with a doc scanning app the images were of good quality.	3

1806	As you described it is dual SIM dual standby (4G+4G), but it doesn't support dual volte. More over it is priced high. With same configuration we are getting real me 2 which is dual volte support and big screen, good camera and much cheaper than this.	1

1811	Pros- The best of part Phone Display Really awesomeLooks, Battery Backup,Rear Camera Good, face unlock perfectly work but face unlock time slow i mean 4-5/Sec, Bezel less  😉Cons-0 to 100% Battery charge time 2/hour 25 mints, Front Camera quality average but not poor, And No Home Button And Touch I'd  Front/Rear	5
1812	Tried one of LG Q6 running Android 7.1.1Don't buy this mobile , its a complete waste of money even for normal users, gamers don't even think of burning your money on this device you will completely regret as its processor so under powered.Only thing good in this mobile is 18:9 screen and its best in segment.App works smoothly like all other mobiles so I can't say its unique to this mobile.Camera is just pathetic ( i use phone camera for normal purposes) and you won't believe its 13MP with the quality of the pic takes (it look more like a picture taken with 8MP camera) and with very less settings!Heating, its a major problem! : Used it for 20 minutes, 2 minutes watching YouTube (1080p quality) and other apps like Chrome, Facebook running in background.Was checking where is the casting option ? Finally downloaded a casting app.Guess what ?This phone don't have Screen Mirroring ( or Miracast Support) only WiFi Direct, WiFi direct is kind of useless.I use LG WebOS TV and its good. But this phone is bad.	2
1813	I bought this phone after checking out details on GSMarena, and boy, that's the mistake I did.No double tap to wake, no NFC, not even a case or screen protector was provided with the phone!The images shot inside house under LED tube light, makes the colour change in images. Red looks orange. Baby pink looks off white.Summary-5/5 for design2/5 for processor (it lags even while scrolling notifications!)3/5 for camera3/5 for charging (takes 2 hours)1/5 for a cheap earphone (why was it even provided!!)4/5 for pulse light notifications4/5 for speakersOverall, not a good phone to purchase when there are other phones in market available at cheaper price than this phone.I wish, I should have done a more research before purchasing.	2
1814	Its a pretty good battery life phone.. Decent photos it clicks	4
1815	Using the ph. for 2 3 weeks.Camera is not up to the mark.I have used lg g3 stylus camera 13mp same but quality in this ph. downfall.Battery falling fast as compare to 3000.Other 3000 batter ph. staying for much longer time then this.Getup of the ph. and Screen is awesome.Overall average ph..Price can be between 11k to 12k then its better.Moto ph. giving this features in around 12k	3
1816	My mobile  got heat up while charging ,does its because  of first time or it can resolve  plz tell	1
1817	Design - 9/10,Camera - 5/10Display - 8/10Sound - 8/10Interface - 8/10Battery- 7/10Mfg quality - 9/10At 15K the phone is not affordable.  I suggest not to buy this phone at this price. LG should atleast read all these reviews and rectify.	2
1818	Really awesome mobile at this price.everything working perfect,faces unlock is too fast.screen is very smooth.Value for money.Good sound quality.i'll recommend if you are looking at this price.Go ahead buy for sure.	4

1821	Thanks Amazon for 2 day delivery for a non prime user..... screen should have been bigger n wider n miui 10 should also be there.... other wise nice phone....	4
1822	Best mobile in this price range. Good 1 day backup for sensible users, low backup for others. Camera better than all MI phones in this price segment. Face unlock and knock knock display on/off better than fingerprint scanner once you/mobile gets used to it.	5
1823	There are tons of reviews that says what is best in the phone. So let me explain only the cons here.Camera : Portrait mode is pathetic.Display : Does not support 1080p or 780p in hotstar and amazon prime. Those who are using these apps do not buy this mobileSound : Very noisy	1
1824	Super handy phone	5
1825	great to use.Doesnt hangs and working smoothly	5
1826	What i liked is battery life, screen sizeWhat i desliked is audio output, the audio output is too low. Back camera is converting green color in blue. The phone weight increases drastically since phone can't be used without cover and tempered glass. I am going to contact Huawei to register complaint regarding camera and output of audio issue.	2
1827	Every thing is good but poor delivery service by Fedex	5
1828	Okok phone. Not soo good. Try any other Mi phone but not A2. Pushy apps generated by Android system .hating it. Only +point camera.	1

1850	Please don't buy this phone .It has so so so poor camera quality.MI disappointed us fully, I have full faith in MI , But it does not worth like 11000.	1
1851	Simple superb.	4
1852	After using of two weeks, i noticed phone getting to much of heat on volume button side. Camera was poor quality. No quick charge.Previous i used moto e3 that was very good mobile than LG Q6. Dont look at brands name if you buy a mobile please think how it helpful to you.	2
1853	Bargain for the price.Love the size. Just right, not too big nor small.The rounded curves make it easy to slip in and out of pocket.Decent batteryGood screen.Will give the big brands a run for their money.	5
1854	Perfect device for me comes with a giant screen, battery life, and a stunning look.	5
1855	Working good with Snapdragon 625 which is its best part. Camera is also good in this price range, camera clarity is good. Just go for it..	5
1856	Best in this price segment . Totally in love with this product. After using for about 1and half month I have written this. Just go for it blindly.	5
1857	Very worst mobile ,2 years back purchase moto g4plus  2 gb ram 16 gb internal memory woth 800 mb free space it will run very smoothly , but this mobile with 22 gb free space struck sometimes , face lock not working , touch screen not working very very worst mobile one star is also waste	1
1858	The display stopped working and turned black within 2 months and service center did asked me to pay Rs 7500 for display replacement as it does not comes under warranty... According to them the damage was due to water spillage which we people call perspiration... unbelievable...the phone is not even perspiration resistant which might be hardly few drops...	1
1859	Great mobileREAD MORE	5
1860	Got this phone at 13500/-Let me break down my review into small parts formally being a user of iPhone I was spoiled with the fast and timely os updates which was a strong reason to buy a Android One phone itself1. OS - The os is stock android as the phone is under Android One program and I must say Stock android is nothing like any android with heavy skin like miui or emui. It is far better in every way. Sure it lack app locker and the some other fancy stuff but it delivers an Experience which u can not understand without using it yourself2. Camera - After reading the reviews and seeing the reviews on YouTube I thought the camera would be amazing but it's more complicated then I thought the pictures. Taken from the camera app both front and back are above average I should say heck some pictures are straight mind-blowing but if I try to click a picture of a document it looses clarity. And I rarely use the default camera app as I am a Snapchat addict and the snap from this phone are disaster I don't know if it is an android thing or the phone itself as i come from apple family and the snaps there are amazing even from a 3 year old device and if I had to decide I would go for 6s camera anyday over a23. Battery- battery life is ok but the charger provided is quite fast and this phone supports quick charge 3 I would say a slim phone with average battery is better then a huge phone After all what are power banks for 😉😉4. Audio - speakers are great but this phone lacks headphones jack5. Built Quality - No issues in this department6. Finger print scanner - snappy is the word I would like to use here7. Face unlock - It is kinda hit and miss but helped me a lot when my fingers were wet or while driving8. Type c port - Versatile is the word that comes to mind afterall as mkbhd said usb c every thing.9. Power - This phone is a beast when it comes to processing the sd 660 is a great soc and anyday better then 636 if you were confused pubg is the only game i played and m really happy with its performanceVerdict - If u can get it at the time of sale and Snapchat Battery life and headphones jack aren't your main priority then go for this phone if you are confused with any other smartphone at this price the stock android is a reason enough to buy this phone.	5
1861	Nice product except sound and Stabilize in camera mode.	4

1938	The phone is very good but the battery backup is very bad. It doesn't last for more than 4-5 hours after a full charge.Overall the phone is average and the battery backup sucks.	3
1939	Average picture quality	3
1940	Good choice	5
1941	Picture sound could be better but bettery backup is awesome.	4

1950	Mobile is very good to look. The camera is also good	5
1951	Working fine	4
1952	Bought yesterday.. Kept charging for 2 hrs.. Software Updated to emui 2.0.. Hoped for better battery hrs with honor.. But disappointed with battery as it drains fast.. Within 30 min it drains from 100 to 80% even in standby mode..	3
1953	Phone is good.But I didn't like EMUI.It makes me feel so bad.Disappointed with emui.	4
1954	The product is really very good	5
1955	The sound quality is more than I expected, speaker and microphone are strong enough.The battery is awesome, I am a medium user and I spend 3 days with a single charge. The Li-Polymer battery is a beast.And it will be a value for money if you buy it. It is the best phone at this price, you will not be able to regret for buying this, and if you miss this you will surely regret in future.#ReviewHonor8X	5

2008	I got this phone for exchange value of 10k. Have used it for more than 2 weeks now.Pros: No heating issue, it bit warm but that cannot be called heating issue. Camera looks are awesone. Phone has fallen few times but is steardy enough to handle falls. Battery if used with battery saver n sync off drains in 1.5day. With sync n batterysaver about 15hrs and about 12hrs with sync n batterysaver off. Have run airborne runs perfectly fine. Front camers group selfie or wide angle festure is awesome. Looks are awesome. Face lock feature is awesome.Whole interface can be customised on every screen.Phone even after loadin about 150 apps with sync on does not hang at all..Cons: no music equaliser, audio output on headfones is not uptothe mark and also there so option to customise it....Not worth more than 11k	5
2009	Good look and best performance phone	5

2012	Very good phone.I have use it . it working nice.	5
2013	(Please read till end )I got lg q6 for 8500 (5000 off on exchanging moto x(2000+3000 extra) + 1500 cash back in bank)So at 8500 it is good but when you go above 10,000 its not good at allI am using lg q6 for 2-3 days and its good but NOT for 15000 ,better wait and get yourself moto g 5s, moto x4,mi 5s these devices are going to be beast .CONCLUSION: If you only want display(awesome display) (attracts people) and are basic user (calls and whatsapp ,Facebook) then it is good otherwise a BIG NO ,front camera is dissapointment ,back camera is averageFace recognition is mediocre ,not good doesn't work most of the timeAnyways at 8500 the best phone available,thanks amazon for awesome deals at independence dayUPDATE:Amazon customer service has taken its worst phase everThe phone i got had all corners depressed (recieved defective item) contacted amazon , after 2-3 calls and an email with pics attached , they agreed to send a service man, who only agrees and tell me to say to amazon that product is not damaged but defective, i agreed to it, now when i call amazon they say that service man found no damage on screen. (-_- this is stupid and unprofession ) he said that they can not replace the defective phone even when it is under replacement warranty and cancelled the call, shame on you amazon , you wasted my time and gave no solution, so i paid for a defective phone.Conclusion : once you pay , its your luck if you are getting a working phone or not.amazon dosent give a damn only reasons .The best tempered glass also had spaces at corners , till now replaced 4 different screen protectors.	2

2101	The phone was delivered on time, but it's speakers stopped working just the next day when my return window closed. Now, I am stuck with this product, and have to run behind motorola service station to resolve it. I prefer to scrap this crappy product and but a new one as time is more important than money for me. This was my precise purpose to buy online, but it is defeated now.I recommend to stay away from Moto G6.	1

2113	Phone appears to be smaller as if it is 4.7 inch.screen is good.performance average.rear camera avg.front camera below average.battery performance satisfactory. Good for this price point. Better than Chinese phones.	4
2114	Every thing is good but screen is too small as per smart phone	4
2115	Nice finishing, easy to handle, very slim, camera is great, the sound quality is superb. Only the thing is phone get heat while playing PUBG & Shadow Fight 3 games from the top side otherwise, overall phone is very good in this budget.	4

2196	I used this cell phone for almost a week amazing cell phone but not enoght camera features n less ram as well as old gen processor. The only reason to return is because I was getting more better feautres than this in approx same price. The thing which I like about Moto is it's quality of products which is amazing	4
2197	Front cam is not good in low light conditions or u can say not good at all.Rest of the things are up to the mark in this price slab.	4
2198	As my heading said. This is an average MI phone. The heating effect on charging could be seen on the first day, Picture quality is decent and works decently fine even in dim light. Being 5.84 inches it comes quite handy and fits properly even in your denims. The notch does gives a trendy look but with Note 6 pro already in the market this would definatelt take a back seat.	3

2208	Hi there,- Don't bother about the negative reviews as the phone is awesome. But know your priorities well.Camera: Hardware is excellent but software needs some improvement. Very decent and does the job nicely, if this is not your highest priority then no worries.Display: Excellent, best in the range I can say.Performance: Excellent again, no lags as such SD 636 and ram management is super. I guess there won't be any issue with heavy gaming although I haven't played any (check YouTube revi...READ MORE	5
2209	Best performanceWell this phone is beastGood performanceSuperb selfie in low light alsoOverall good package	5
2210	I have been using this phone since 25th Oct, and honestly i have mixed feelings about the device(mostly good), so i am going to divide my review in Pros and Cons and will let you decide if you can live with the cons or not.Pros:1. Phone just feels great: when you open the phone from box, it feels so premium and stylish, you will fall in love with it then and there.2. High quality Screen: the screen looks really nice and the quality is 10/10. you will get premium phones high quality Screen experience, honor has make sure of that.3. Battery: I was very Impressed with the battery performance, if you are a regular user who use the phone for usual stuff like calls, social networking and moderate gaming or video watching, then the battery can even last more than 24hrs easily.and even for moderate to advanced users, the Battery is not something to worry about for full working day.4. UI - User interface is user friendly and has something for everyone, certainly much better than my last phone - Xiaomi MI Max.5. Bigger display - whooping 6.5 inch display is simply a treat to watch, even the notch management is top notch(pun intended :-D), specially if you like to watch video in phone, then certainly this phone can give really good viewing experience.6. screen cover and backcase: kudos to Honor for their Backcase and screen guard with the box, the quality of both are good and certainly you don't need to buy these separately(if you don't have anything specific in your mind).7. Ram Management: Ram management is good with phone and you won't face any issues with Ram related performance, hence you can be assured for good gaming experience specially on moderate settings.Cons:1. Phone Hanging Issue: this was really a shocker, i never imagined that i ll face frozen screen issue within first week of phone, i have faced frozen screen issue multiple times and its really frustrating, hopefully someone from Honor check this and rectify this with software updates.2. Camera Quality: well, i am a little disappointed with camera quality specially when it has 20(back) and 16(front) Megapixel shooters. its not bad but more like hit or miss, the quality is not consistent, i am guessing honor can take this up and fix it with software updates. i ll try to put some samples pics  later sometime.3. long charging time: more than 2 to 2.5 hrs is certainly not a feel good factor for me.4. Speaker volume: what to say, it is low. Although doesn't matter much to me as i hardly use speaker for calls except Whatsapp or other video calls.5. audio playback of media even when phone is kept on silent: This is something which troubled me in office, even when my phone is in silent/vibration mode, while playing video on social media sites, the Audio playback is not silenced. this can put you in awkward situation sometimes(personal experience :P) , although i really hope Honor fix this with updates.My overall conclusion: Overall i really loved the phone and most of the issues i have seen and witnessed, can be fixed with software updates, hopefully Honor realize the same and work on it to fix the issues.having said that Phone is definitely packed with brownie points, specially crisp and bigger display, long lasting battery and premium feel of the phone, these features really makes it a great product at this price range.	4

2251	My mi 6 pro no face unlock option ?	2
2252	I bought this phone on the 11th of October and due to Amazon's timely service in received it on the 15th of October.  I love this phone. It's amazing and suits every need of mine.  The packaging was done really well and all in all the product is really good.  I am so happy with my purchase. The camera,  music,  battery,  display,  every thing is really good and worth every penny. If you're looking for a good phone within this price range, the Redmi 6 Pro is an amazing choice 😊	5
2253	Just looks so nice and slim,screen is mindblowing and overall good phone from LG.Loved it.	5

2257	Not worth the price. Should have been a SD 625 processor at this price.No quick charging as well.	3
2258	Camera is not up to mark, readme note 5 pro camera is much better then 6 pro. Overall 6 pro is perfect ❤ phone.	3
2259	Sounds are loud but not enough clarity	4
2260	Battery life is the weakest in this smartphone while it's camera's are too good in this price point	4
2261	Great display with awesome battery back-up but the fingerprint/face unlock isn't the best. After the MIUI 10 update the fingerprint unlock seems to be ok though. Been using it for a month now and is not laggy even while playing games. No quick charge is a bummer. Value for money product.	4
2262	Camera features, sound quality, charging are good and some software features are not good may be software updates are make me good condition.	4

2265	It's an amazing phone. But I would not recommend this phone for selfie lovers.	5
2266	Average. Not at all worthy for its price and quality, battery life gradually decreases after 3 mnths of use	3
2267	Excellent phone with this price range.	5
2268	Battery life ok picture quality need improvement	5
2269	Definitely happy with this phone. Wasn't expecting much at the price but really gives you a value for your money. Runs fast, no latency, amazing picture quality and sound. Love it. Writing this review from the phone!	5
2270	Good phone. Definitely not flagship features if that is what you are expecting. But works for everyday use. I got an awesome offer with exchange for my old phone (around 50% price reduction) and went for it and I don't regret my purchase. Good phone at this price point.Edit: After 2 months of use, I find that the call quality is a little low and the other side is a little muffled. But the microphone seems to be ok as the other person can hear me clearly. Otherwise this is a good phone for general use.	4
2271	Camera is not good as expected and ear phones plug is type c. Gestures features also not good as expected.	2
2272	Width is little less. Still good phone. Face unlock and finger print unlocks are awasome	5
2273	Awesome phone. The features are amazing.sound is ok ok.	5
2274	The battery is amazing.Camera quality is very good but could have been a little better as compared with the competitors like A2 and Realme2 etc.Feels a little heavy but that's cause of the amazing 5000 mAh battery	5
2275	Great battery and performance	5
2276	Very good quality	5
2277	At this price range, The best phone I have brought.. Using Moto Products right from Moto G, Moto G3 and now G6 and haven't been disappointed.. Even the packaging and delivery was great by Amazon	5
2278	Mobile is completely worth for the money . I have been using it for almost 2months now and I never felt issues . I play games a lot and haven't faced any heating issues . Don't get confused with the other comments above . I donno whether they really purchased Redmi 6 pro or not 😅.Photography is pretty good . They could have did much better in the portrait mode and it depends on the MIUI updates . So it's not that bigger issue.Like all the other Xiaomi phones even this got a good battery life .Overall I'm satisfied with the brought of this phone..and I'm sincerely genuine in reviewing it. ✌️	5
2279	No difference, equal to redmi 5a	3
2280	This phone has excellent features but fails in the audio department. Missing my exchanged Lenovo K4 Note with Dolby Atmos & stereo speakers...	5
2281	Its good to use.. Picture quality is nice..	4
2282	Everything is good compares to price tag	4
2283	Battery life is not satisfactory	4
2284	Super performance good slim lookReally loved this	5
2285	Best camera phone. Sound quality is ok because only one speaker but two speaker point. Battery life is worst. Heating mobile while charging. Some internal problem also there. Not worth for 15000 to 20000.	1
2286	"The phone is good and screen is awesome. But the size of mobile is too small. It looks like a baby mobile in front of 5.5"" mobiles.And one more thing, the low light camera sucks and there is no notification light.This mobile would have been good at price of 10k. 15 k is too much."	3
2287	I recommend.. Everything is perfect	5

2307	Phone is awesome and gorgeous look.....but my product have some straches on it.........but overall styless look	4
2308	I'm writing this review after using this phone for more than a month.Only with few days of normal usage, the gorilla glass got scratches.Back panel is slippery and easily got scratches just by putting it on table.Poor camera.Face detection is not good enough.Phone hangs a lot during game play or video playback.	1
2309	Camera is amazing , but images are little vibrant ,and sometimes over exposed.Sound quality is good and I wish they had given a dual led flash andFor a screen size this big the battery doesn't do justice , rest everything is amazing .Looking forward for more battery optimisation	3

2337	Amazing phone with extremely premium design.Bought 4gb & 64gb version for 12500 including amazon cashback and bank discountNo other phone have this much of features in this offering, so just go for it.Battery backup, unlock systems are also good.First time using honor.. Nd not disappointed.. Beyond limits...only issue is camera quality... Need to be improved as there are so many options in this price range, honour should have to notice. For a better camera one can go for redmi note 6 Pro... Other wise honour has no match in this category.	5
2338	Getting heated up with simple use and camera quality is not that good. But it is handy, lite weight and 18:9 screen vision is nice.	2
2339	Very nice mobile.. Awesome..	5
2340	Excellent phone ever I have purchasedValue for money and qualityThanks to samsung	5
2341	I've had this phone for a couple days and so far I am beyond happy with my purchase, the phone works great and is better than I could have ever imagined at this price! One of this biggest pros about this phone for me is the battery life.  I am very happy with my purchase and will definitely be checking out Xiaomi again when I am looking to buy my next phone in the future which I feel will not be anytime soon with how good.this phone is in my opinion!	4
2342	Excellent smartphone from LG.	5
2343	Initially i had a great confusion of which phone to buy for my wife, then had two options in mind One was Vivo which my family members are using for past three years, another was Redmi, but thought let ,me go for redmi this time and to be very frank this is a very best phone that anyone can afford with all latest options and features, very good phone for the price paid, people who wanted to buy a cheap and best phone please buy Redmi Phones	5
2344	Very good phone in very good price	5
2345	Everything is so good when compared with other phones with the same price range, the only disadvantage I felt is, it is few grams heavier.	4
2346	Heating too much ,battery backup is not good not supporting to sites like irctc network signals not good camara quality not good nothing i except from this phone simply westing my 15000 thousand	1
2347	Nice phone but weight is heavy....	4
2348	Value for money.. Good Purchase..	5

2350	Poor performance not value for money don't waste your money buying it	1
2351	Very nice phone, look is awesome, nice camera performance and battery is more than expected.	5
2352	i used LG products from past 4 years and i had strong brand faith, but this time i am very disappointed at your product LGQ6 i bought this smart phone 1 week back and its display is broken. this phone is horrible it heat up very quickly and its not all a durable product. I spoke in your customer support about the repair cost i was being told that i need to pay RS6668 as for screen replacement as it is not under warranty. i bought this phone in RS12000 which did not even lasted for a week and now i am being asked to pay RS 6668 for repair. as a customer i just want answer in yes or no Do you justify this price. i will never buy LG product ever again nor i will suggest any one to buy it. i am felling very cheated  right now your so called LGQ6 is worst then any local smart phone. And you lost 1 very loyal customer i know all this this are not really very important for you and i am very sure that nothing is going to change nor i will get any special treatment but i want whole wold to know this that LG is now cheating its users sorrythank you with regardstulika	1
2353	Good Camera Quality	5
2354	Obviously 3000 mah battery disappointed, but wen u find this beauty phone in your palm, u love it more and more... Overall very lovely piece P20 lite blue	4
2355	Awesome picture quality as well as sound quality along with good processor speed. But gorilla glass should be there for the screen protection. Good display with Hd video recording feature.	5
2356	Good camera and good display	4
2357	Phone with amazing camera and OS experience due to stock android... A dedicated sim slot and 3.5 mm jack would have made this phone a killer deal.. a bump in the battery capacity would make this phone complete..	5
2358	Phone is Good but Battery issue problem	3
2359	The device is really smooth and awesome.	5
2360	👌	4
2361	I'm highly dissatisfied with payment option.My No cost EMI with zero % interest is converted to 14% interest.	1
2362	At this price range. Its a really good phone to buy. You can play games like PUBG and all. Battery life is awesome. But Camera quality is below par. Both front and back camers deliver faded photos and bad performance in low light. Otherwise overall performance is good and satisfactory.	4
2363	Phone looking very small but smart	4
2364	Overall awesome product except battery, if fully charged longs for Max 10hours. Worthful for the amount.	4
2365	Every thing is fine but once I updated a new version speaker is not working fine in sometimes and I am facing hanging problem	3
2366	All OKWhy Credit card has debited me all the amount ,while as  I have purchased  the product  in 6 EMIs	4
2367	Bought this phone in the month of July and from the day 1, this phone has always amazed me.. I would say guys come out from Redmi Vivo and oppo.. this Huawei is changing the way we are using the phone.. Call it picture quality, sound quality and hardware and software quality is just amazing. It's was much much better phone when i bought it, in the market.. the brand is really good, so guys try this phone or any other product by Huawei at this range.. you will not get dissatisfied.	5
2368	this phone is lookwise great and performance is also good. overall a good deal	4

2385	I love this phone .. camera , sound is goodAnd battery is awesome.....must buy this phone...	5
2386	The phone is great. Quality build , great size , hd display, great sound when Dolby audio feature is turned on,many small features ensure easy use.Battery life is normal but turbo charger ensures you don't need to worry about it.Camera is ok but you can use manual adjusts to enhance it.Gaming graphicsis in low settings when you run PUBG.You may concider Asus max pro m1 64gb/6gb with not so good build ,lesser features and finish but better gaming and camera.PACKING FROM AMAZON - POOR - directly under the plastic seal was the Motorola box.No carton packed protection.I guess good packing and handling is only for prime members as we non-primes only pay the full price for the phone :D.	4
2387	Excellent mobile	5

2399	The most stylish phone xiaomi has ever introduced. Loved every bit of it. Front camera is the only issue. Highly recommended. Go Get One  😎	5
2400	I would like to highlight few issues which I observed compared to other mobiles although it's better for the price he is giving.1. If I click on any link, it takes through MI browser instead of chrome and I did not see option to select chrome as default browser it's a big pain. Very very difficult to uninstall MI apps by general public, he should have knowledge on how software works in order to uninstall.2. Max volume & Brightness is less when compared to other mobiles.3. Display clarity is little low even when compared with Lenevo K6 Power.4. New work reception & net speed is 20% less.5. Lot of times finger unlock is not working.6. Bluetooth signal breaks if mobile placed in back picked it has become a pain while Jogging and cycling.7. Display size is not what we imagine before buying, few notifications on top centre hidden as speaker and sensor r placed in display.	3

2417	Dear friends, over all supb phone expect front camera quality, and so disappointed in delivery....	4
2418	From the day 1 camera application not working...so much heared about the honor 8x but disappointed with the phone... already informed to Amazon and they have arranged replacement...12/11/18 now Amazon has made replacement for this device and my new device working fine. Friends don't think about 6.5inch screen. It's definitely handy with 1hand. 200% go for it.	5
2419	Picture quality is average and sound is good battery life is excellent	4
2420	Picture quality is not that good. It does give natural pics. Front camera is pathetic.	2
2421	It's picture quality is quite perfect.In this range this is an amazing phone.but battery is it's main problem otherwise this is good at all.....	4
2422	Nice mobile in 15.5 K	5
2423	Perfect camera	5
2424	For the price you pay, getting it when there are bank offers is a good deal, otherwise at the selling price, its a no go as there are other products at the same price point having better camera and sound quality	5
2425	Picure quality is quit good and display , sound and battery life is just awesome !	5

2429	A bit thick.	3
2430	Waste and warest battery Life and mobile hanging calling dail pad	2
2431	Bought this phone specifically for using with a local sim in the US. This phone was neither compatible with the AT &T sim card nor could I use the roaming facility on my Vodafone (India) sim card  . Worse, the service person at AT&T gave a disdainful look at my prized possession !  eventually I had to use dual sim on my One plus 3 and ran up excess billing  on  both networks, inadvertently making international calls on both networks.. Choosing Nokia turned out to be too costly :( I now use this as a tablet and will carry a  basic Samsung model when I travel next !	1

2439	The legendary smartphone with Android One. Out-of-the-box runs Oreo, 8.1, soon upgraded to 9, Pie. Cameras are good, not the best, dark shots are blurry. Sound quality is low, not as expected. Tears in loud sounds. Battery life is not good. 3300 mAh, lasts only a day for 7 to 8 hours screen on time. Overall performance is smooth, thanks to Qualcomm Snapdragon 660, and 4GB RAM. 64 GB version is enough for typical day to day usage and apps. Lack of headphone jack and micro SD card doesn't bother for a daily user, not any media fanatic. Great device.	5
2440	Good choise	5
2441	Redmi 6 pro is having a awesome display quality with a premium look because of the notch display	5
2442	Good mobile but this is worth of only 8000.	4

2447	Camera very poor	2
2448	The product is great with quite good features. I am great fan of xiaomi and I have been always using Xiaomi phones. But I am disappointed with mobile designing of Xiaomi as most of all the lower range and  mid range phones have same design. Xiaomi has always  given smartphones with so many features but being realme entering in market Xiaomi has to be more creative to attract more indian customers.	3
2449	Good phone ,looks good compare to Redmi note 5 pro.Worth of money	5
2450	It's a reliable model	5

2453	during Whatsapp video call mic not working or very slow from day 1st voice received at reptilian end, you have to use hand free to call, Nokia care also not aware with this new model	1
2454	Whenever I make a call, after the call ended the network got disconnected and it is taking 2 minutes to acquire it again. Also the phone gets rebooted again. So I replaced the product with a new one, where I faced the same issue again.	1
2455	Phone is awesome as I saw and hear review from other users .There is some leaving issue in sometime when you are used some apps in same time and any one called you.	5
2456	Phone feels very premium to hold. Built quality is very good.And about the camera it is very good in this price range.	5
2457	Iam already using this phone, and purchased another for my son. Good one and value for money.	5
2458	Horrible experience with both of its camera...even my old samsung 8 MP camera is better than this phone..experience is gonna worst with low light pics.	2

2481	Does not support dual 4g standby support. Only one sim work on 4g & second sim work 3g or 2g on same time. Performance not so satisfying as compare price range of 13000/-. Camera not get quick shoot on portrait mode. It take one picture after click 4 times. Pubg game also not working properly. Snapdragon 625 chipset which is not so fast processor. If this divice come with snapdragon 636 then this phone will okay.In my opinion please don't buy it with 13000 rs. Otherwise you will also regret like me.	3

2542	Good phone but not the best in this price range. I used note 4 and I was highly satisfied with that where as this one with poor back and front camera slowest CPU which hangs during making video as well as taking pics, not good for gaming. The notch is poorly designed as icons can be seen inside the notch getting hidden as it was a infinity display forcefully given a notch. The only great this is playing video HD and battery else all outdated	4
2543	In returned mobile although software was great	4

2569	As I'm writing this review after using it for 1 week. As it seems, that it is a good phone as per the specs and its performance.Features I liked the most:-1. Battery life2. Sound quality3. Picture quality4. Smoothness5. Accurate sensors6. Suitable for using with one hand7. Camera's are excellent as per the daily useThis was my review. I think that it is not a camera  phone like oppo or vivo but it is a phone which can/should be used for commercial use.Five stars are accurate for it.Thank You.	5

With internet usage it's working for 1.1/2 day.But MAJOR Constraint is - your eyes become blur when u see the (netwrok)signal bar on the top of the screen(Beside battery bar). Visually it's irritating the eyes with blur effect.  It may cause for eye sight . Look like 3d symbol when using dual SIM.suggestion to Redmi - plz change it in next update. Or else provide an option to change the visual style of notification bar  ....(battery/signal/time etc..these options should be customised)	4

2672	very good phone met my expectation in all parameters	5
2673	Well I cannot say much but this is one time smart phone for day to day use and trust me you will never feel lag or glitch on main stream application.It's has premier looks but notch is wider and can't really feel like flagship.Decent and early user	5
2674	Save your money and don't buy this phone or anything form MI. Bad product quality. My screen went off in the first week. Had to spend 4 hours to get it repaired at their center. Went blank again in the next week. Spent few hours travelling to repair centre. Total waste of money. They didn't replace the phone even after such performance in the first 2 months. Buy one plus or Samsung or nokia than MI! Cheap phone and horrible quality.	1
2675	Pour  battery performance  and it's  embarrassing	3
2676	After using for 10 months, I can say that it was a good looking at that time in the price but I regret the choice coz battery backup is worst. And now there r many other options. So plz dnt buy.	1

I am switching from Windows to Android. couldn't find any import or export function for copying contacts from my old phone.  it fell short of my expectations.After OTA  update battery is working proper...READ MORE	4

2695	The Xiaomi Mi A2 is a jack of all trades and master of some. It has a stellar camera and reliable performance, packaged in a robust, functional design. Despite a few compromises here and there, the A2 stands up to its name of offering a smooth, consistent experience and improves largely on its imaging prowess, especially in low-light.	5

2728	Awesome Phone. Purchased it during the Great India Shopping Festival in exchnage of my 5 months old Moto G5. Really happy with my purchase, expecially after totally hating the G5 series of Moto which was total flop. THePros: 18:9 screenWide angle selfie cameraUICons:Rear camera not so good in low light	5
2729	Its a very good full vision display i😍love it	5
2730	Display and other materials used are of superior quality. Good battery life which easily takes care of a day. It surely meets your expectations.An overall promissing phone.	5
2731	You need a lot of knowledge to plg in headphone	4
2732	Overall the product is very good	5
2733	Bought this for my Mother, she was earlier using a Samsung, I must say the moment I opened the box I fell in love with the device, the notch design is graceful, moreover with the new update the UI is even crisper and better than it competitors... The only thing that nags me though is it is not thin enough!Otherwise for medium users (calls, whatsapp, browsing, FB and few other apps) it is a good option. I would give it an overall rating of 4/5, Only because of its thickness, rest all specs - Its a winner as always from MI. And amazon is AMAZE-on...the delivery schedule & packaging is marvelous!	4
2734	good looking mobile and samarthan keypad and hang less , I like this phone	5
2735	Very Bad mobile phone	1

2739	in the mi 6 pro picture quality is medium. battery life also good but sometimes this phone is working little bit slow	5
2740	It's one of the best phones around at below 15k price. Finest features and build quality. So impressed with the quality that ordered 2 phone for family members.	5
2741	As expected	5
2742	Many people are disliking this phone just because of two things-3.5mm jack and expandable storage! But xiaomi provides a dongle for earphones and regarding storage, you can use cloud storage. Its look is simply amazing! Premium and so thin that it feels good in hand.. If you have this phone you get flagship sort of phone. Proud Mi A2 user. Go for it!!	5
2743	Picture quality up the level of this range. Reasonable standby time. Very slim phone. I like it. Powerful phone.Good for Kid holders... U will be having a nice memory to ur kids	4
2744	The camera is very clear.  And battery life is also good.	5
2745	Camera quality very poor. Very slow working. Moto g3 is better than g6.Very bad experience with this phone.West of money.	1
2746	A great phone by a great brand the only thing which bothered me was delivery boy attitude.  I bought this phone in exchange of my old phone which had a small crack on top of it. When i showed the phone to delivery person he started his tantrum that he wont accept. Also he said he is canceling my order. Then he said the most mischievous thing give me 500 and i will get it repaired and then submit it.  As i had no any other option i paid him 500 inr . god knows whether he got it repaired or whatBut anyways i am happy with my phone	5
2747	Battery life is a issue.	4

2756	1 - LG does not lie . Xiaomi lies all the time.Proof : search for xiaomi aggregation.2 - LG asks, and won't steal data. Seoul is not Beijing.Proof : search for xiaomi backdoor.search for miui backdoor.3) LG does not abuses the open source community.Proof : search for xiaomi gpl4) Even through xiaomi claims that rooting the phone won't void warranty, it's practically meaningless because they don't have to open all drivers.  Hence finger and camera in custom ROM of xiaomi phones is not good.5) LG is giving carrier aggregation on this phone despite having SD435, OTOH, none of xiaomi phones give this feature, despite having better SD(625,650,820/21).Reasons in favour of xiaomi include, the  argument that SD in 10K, but it's  a myth and propagated by under informed YouTube reviewers.  They are just in capable of seeing through the inside of the specs.Xiaomi does not give the costly features of the SD processors, and they lie and cheat all the time when you raise this question on their forums.LG was very professional while having a conversation.If you care about privacy, and your contact information, and your documents, and don't want them to  fall into the hands of Chinese government, don't buy or use any software from China.Proof :search for one plus mining.It's scary.Stock android and pure android does not mean that there can be no backdoor service, however minor.Proof :Search forThe Cyberspace Administration of China  rules.And, people considering 10or, call their customer care first and try to talk to them and ask some basic questions.  The professionaism of 10or customer care will baffle you and make you not talk to them ever again.	5

2773	I've always been a Moto fan, so it's normal that I chose G6 over other phones in this price range....But seriously, Moto never fails to make me happy. This phone has a decent battery life.The design is just 😍The fingerprint scanner cannot be more accurate.The screen , it's so crispyComes with Dolby AtmosIt's lightweight and sleekBut there are few things I don't like too..The face recognition is not that accurate unlike Moto G4plusThe camera could be better.That's all.	5
2774	Very bad don't buy it only good is its display	2
2775	I have used it continuosly for 3 hours....No lags ..smooth functioning..good audio clarity..decent camera.. OS is nice.Battery seems to be decentFacerecognition workred 80% of thetime, i played 2 graphic intensive games found no lags.LG can make sm serious dent in mobile market  if it goes on like this , my colleague in office saw this little beast and said that its better than his one plus five in terms of display...cheers	5
2776	This phone has a good display but it's not good in all other aspects like camera is not good, front camera is worst it blurs every picture, speaker at the back(you have to keep phone upside down if you are listening music), backside is scratch prone, volume control buttons of 5he earphones are not supported	2

2785	Positives First : First of all, amazing color share and super light,Best screen to body ratio,Super camera, crisp pictures and good rral color display.Negatives : battery takes more time taking quick charge into consideration.Front camera steps back in night mode.Leather cover or better cover expected instead of plastic one	5

2799	Best value for money, both sims can use 4g signal at same time. My dad liked it a lot. Only trick is this gold color comes for 2000 less price and you can buy any black case and so you get it for ~1500 cheaper.	5

2817	Very bad quality	1
2818	System apps doesn't work properly.I was using Billion capture plus. My old mobile was much better then this pro 6 in all aspects.	3
2819	Best Phone	5
2820	The phone is good style wise....but performance wise it's a disappointment! The camera is no good...even under light it's taking average photos.The worst part however is HEATING! use it for a while to watch videos or surf the net and it heats so much....it literally burns! The battery is very average and needs charging every 4-5 hrs!	3
2821	Hi redmi 6pro very cheap quality phone don't go for this cheap only battery good remaining camera display sound everything worst ... Don't go for this cheap blindly ...	3
2822	ITS JUST AUSUM.18:9 DISPLAY BRINGS A FULL VISON DISPLAY.5.5 INCHES DOES FEEL IT BIG.CAMERA IS EXCELLENT.FAST PROCESSOR AND NICE RAM.A GUD THING ABOUT PHONE IS DOESNT COME HYBRID SIM AS OTHERS.IT AS DEDICATED SLOT FOR EVERTHING..	5

2826	Everything ok	5
2827	Good phone with reasonable price and bundles. Of new features such as Face unlock, 18:9 screen, Clear and wide display, OS 7.0 :)	5
2828	Picture quality poor than vivo oppo	4
2829	Wifi receiving is very poor or worst posseble.I have 5 g router,but a big problem in this phone.I have MI Redmi note 5 and LG.I have never faced such a big prob.So far camera concern shutter is too slow.One click taking 10 secs.Auto focus in FPS mode not working.Fps(frame per second) is 10 ....good.Photo quality is very good even in low light.Glamorous looking. Very good body.Screen is outstanding.So far Price concern I think before buying think twice.I suggest not to go with this price of Rs18999/_It should be max 15k.	3
2830	No heating issues after a quick android update received on starting the phone at first...infinity display a best feature, sound is OK,front camera average,multi tasking smooth, worth the buy	4
2831	Very Good quality In under 15000..	4
2832	Satisfied WID another mi product.	5
2833	What a complete package it is! Gives battery backup of more than 1 day, sound quality is nice too, speakers are loud enough, I don't know why honor 8x users are complaining about the same. Camera quality is average, it would be better not to use AI feature btw. Screen looks vibrant and attractive. Phone can be handled easily, Design is really really attractive. Back is glossy, It would be too risky to carry the device without cover case though. Fingerprint sensor is excellent.Now moving to the cons, It takes a very long time to be charged, face unlock is terrible, takes 1-2 seconds to unlock, and sometimes it doesn't even work!! front camera is below averageTo sum it all, the phone is definitely worth buying 😊	5
2834	Had bought this product for my mom and she loved it. The endless screen display is cool.	5
2835	Nice Performance	4
2836	Amazon services rocks.They have proper channels which help in delivery and return , soon Amazon would be the only player in market and delivery and redressal systems are very streamlinedOn the other hand xiaomi phone is also nice, bought it for my father  , he likes the audio and video  clarity	5

2842	Good option as a mid range device for a daily uses	4
2843	Simply Awesome.....	5
2844	Mi A2 design and look is awesome.Though storage cannot be expanded i think 64 gb is more than enough.Pictures taken with both cameras comes out really well.Disappointed with battery life.It drains fast.People who want pure android experience and good camera should buy this phone.Overall Value for money.4/5	5
2845	The agent is so harsh, when I called him to update that the contact number given is worth, he says don't call distrub him, he will come when he wants.	4

2855	Amazing device...Extremely smooth working courtesy to KIRIN 710 process.Amazing camera nd when it detects the scene in AI MODE the pictures are mind blowing😇😇😇I'm writing this review after one nd a half months of usage.....It doesn't lags even in games like PUBG, ASPHALT 9.....Battery life is enough for a day use........Overall it's  surely a REALME 2 PRO KILLER	5

And we can't delete multiple contact at a time.Their is internet tracker option.Their is no proper geature option.Totally this phone is not user friendly.They have given software life as 9 rate out of 10 . But I will say software is 5/10 .Waste ,worst phone with the 18 k.I wasted my 18k for this kind of waste phone.Please don't with this phone.	1

2881	After using for one month white lines started to appear on my screen.Camera is also really bad. Please don t by this product if you value your money	1
2882	Great phone. Amazing Display. Good battery life.Its main advantage is the display and build quality which stands out from the crowd of redmis and other chinese mobilesLatest Android Nougat and UI is quite fluid and no lagging at all even with 10-12 apps running in background. Not tried any games yetBattery drain is very less. Even with apps like whatsapp, pacer (step counter) running all the time.Speaker output is quite good even when the phone is on table (Speaker is at the back).Camera is decent for day to day photos and selfiesOnly issue is lack of fingerprint sensor and the fact that knockcode is also not given by LG for Q6 even though it is standard for low end LG devices. Hopefully they should give it as firmware update.	5
2883	Everything is GOOD	5
2884	Thanks Amazon, for Nice deal & Best device in Price range..	5

2894	Good product I love it little bit battery I more want.	5
2895	I will keep it simple. It's an awesome phone. I use Samsung s9 plus and when I bought this product, I can not resist keeping it down. My s9 plus is just kept beside and neglected. Guys don't waste your money buying 50 to 60 thousand rupees just for show off. Buy mi 6 pro. Excellent phone. Camera needs some improvement thousand. Overall 4.5 stars rating.	5

2900	as per mentioned in product description body aluminum but its plastic body, also requested Platinum color and received black on. required to product as mention otherwise take it back.Durable on All Sides Now Knock it without FearThe LG Q6's metal body is solidified by the lightweight 'H Beam' frame made from incredibly strong 7000 series aluminum. It's designed to better endure impact from any direction.	1
2901	Excellent product in this price	5
2902	The screen size is defective, you cant watch video in the desired aspect ratio. The sound quality is horribly weak and metallic. And most importantly, you can not return the product. They will only replace it. A very bad expenditure.	1
2903	Got this device 11aug, amazon delivery is superb, device in this price range is nice, look is awesome, easy to hold it fit in palm easly, display is realy nice, both sim slot have volte connectivity..	4
2904	Some of my observations after 5 days of usage:Pros: 1. Regarding the looks it is one of the best I could find in this range. It has glass back and feels premium. 2. Compact size. It can be operated with one hand easily. 3. Display is excellent. 4. I didn't observe any lag and apps loaded quickly.4. Calling quality is good and I didn't face any problem regarding network. 5. It has true 4G which means two Jio Sims will work simultaneously.6. Camera quality is good. It takes decent pictu...READ MORE	5

2909	Im an asus zenfone max user for 2.5 years which is truly now has slowed down and was irritating me for a couple of months as some space of the screen wasn't working. It was solely the phone's problem. As i use phone only for WA FB UTUBE.I play absolutely no games whatsoever.So i was thinking to buy a new phone.Then i faced a real dillemma between realme 2 pro and asus max pro m1.Being a 5k Mah battery user it was difficult to move from asus. But specs in asus aren't that good with sd636 and 4 gb variant with camera negative reviews.I needed a phone within 12 to 15k.The first look of realme 2 pro was amazing which gradually faded with negative color os and battery reviews though i thought of giving it a go as the display was like wowowowow.But i chose to wait for asus max pro m2 as some leaks said it will come with notch(i needed notch) and sd660.And asus didn't come. Spoiled my waiting time.I knew whatever phone i will buy will give me a lifespan of 2 to 3 yrs at max as they're truly manufactured that way..Honor 8x then launched and it had all the specs i needed.. Kirin 710 is same as sd660 or u can say sd670 in some aspects.It only didn't have that humongous battery of asus(what's d actual problem of giving a high capacity battery for gods sake).Still reading positive reviews regarding the battery life i ordered the phone.The phone now:Everything is good as I'm very light user with no games in my phone (i play fifa in desktop).The screen is sexy.Sound is good. But Not Louder than redmi note 5 pro.Full screen display will catch everyone's attention while you travel in public.Camera is over saturated TBH. Doesn't matter to me.Some great UI specs. See some utube for this.Your total footsteps per day will be counted in this phone. I mean wowwowowow.Processor is super fast as i was using sd625 for 2.5 yrs.Battery is good as kirin 710 optimised well.But i can guarantee the battery life will be good for first year of use.. It will create issues after 1 to 1.5 yrs.Phone is light weight.Headphone negative reviews are false.It opens a new equaliser when u plug your headphone.It has 3d audio calibration which works well.Ram management is good.It has given me peace of Mind tbh.No. Cons for me as i got it at 12.5 after several discounts.Only issue is battery could have been around 4.2k Mah.Battery is a crucial factor for me.Go.for it if you want people turn their head to your phone.	5
2910	Superb mob. Excellent features and quality. you will love it.	5
2911	Best camera phone with stock android and a quality chipset.	5
2912	It's been around a month. It's running fantastic. No problems yet. Very responsive very smooth.	5
2913	Excellent quality	5
2914	Omg what a disappointment..- first off i come from a 3 yr old redmi note 3 which is a wonderful phone.- when I opened up the phone. Straight away i could notice the yellow screen the whites are actually offwhite next to. My redmi note 3 it was clear as day that the miA2 has a yellowish tint to the display.  And there were no settings to change that unlike in miui. What's the point of such great cameras when the display colours are inaccurate.- moving on under low light if you open the camera app you can see flickering which is such an annoying thing to be honest. Never faced any such issues with my redmi note 3. Even today i tried to take a photo of a document in office normal tubelights it was still flickering wtf... And this was not low light there was enough light.. Here.. To top it all when i clicked the photo the bands were visible in the actual photo.. I was like what a waste...Then i checked outdoor in sunlight there the camera was fine.- coming to. More software issues there is no face unlock.. Even after i updated to latest update by google the options were not there... The smart lock menu was blank.- the goodies from MIUI are missed very badly i really don't get it why people go gaga over stock android..I can't see the ram usage in recent apps.No fm radio, screenrecorder, no scanner app, no applock feature, no option to use fingerprint scanner to take photos, no audio call recording, no antivirus memory cleaning apps. Biggest of all the gallery app is not there and google photos album setup is bad.. Miui had a fantastic gallery management app. Keeping everything neat and tidy. I had to. Make separate foldersfor the device albums.. No option to get rid of google search bar unless you install a launcher.Coming to even more software issues the autobrightness omg is terrible it has a mind of its own. I neverhad to use two hands to take a screenshot. You can't change the layout of the buttons or any additional features like hold on back button to force kill an app which is there in miui..The battery life.. : I'm not a heavy user but i can see the battery drain is comparatively more than redmi note 3 I don't think it would last me a full  day like this. Its livableI liked the design that's why i bought it specially the colour options but that camera bump is too big and protrudes even after applying the included case.. I'm worriedit would be scratched soon enough.So i can't flaunt that design.. Redmi note 5 pro is a better option... I think I'll have to install miui 10 on it to use it to full potential.. Rest you be the judge... In my view the software is a big let down...	2
2915	I just loved the design and built quality. It's really amazing. Camera is okay for this price range. Little disappointed in chipset. This mobile comes with KIRIN 659 which is also powerful but does not support 4k videos.I liked selfie camera which is 24 megapixel, whis is doing its job great. Another problem is no silicon back cade is included. Phones cheaper than this model has this silicone case. Overall phone build is awesome, inhand fell is good. This good is great at this price range with someof the cons. That's it.	4
2916	Like : Battery, Cameras, notch screen, style, sound, MiUi, etc.Dislike : No zoom in front camera also no flash light,Notch not working while watching videos, coordination between notch and screen is may b faulty, MiUi creates lots of vivid settings which creates confusion.	4
2917	I bought this mobile and had been used for one month. Working well and especially long life battery.	4
2918	Display is average , quality of product is very low ..if its slip from ur hands ...screen get break	2
2919	Its a perfect phone but just need to fix its sound quality.	5
2920	Just lacks the fingerprint sensor, Otherwise good mobile. I havebeen using it for last 2 months.	4
2921	Size or dizine comfortable in my head . This second mi fone in use fast is mia1  mia1 in large my hand  camera qawality is low but this prize wonderful headset thengs for mi	5
2922	Awsome	5
2923	Sound volume is to low for call or video, WiFi or data is lagging even though I have 4g connection I am not getting full speed.very poor product hanging problem also.	1
2924	Not Satified	2
2925	Bought the phone the day it launched, using  more than 5 weeks. In one word excellent. Big clear display. Software smooth. Very good network reception. Finally battery, works for 1 and half day, forget power bank.I bought this exchanging Oppo f3, so paid around 9800. In this price it is the best someone can get.	5
2926	Everything is fine except earphone sound	5
2927	I bought this mobile in diwali sale. Mobile picture quality and processed are very good. Battery is life good too you should charge 30mins in a day for full battery as it has a fast charger and battery will be left for 24 hrs. Mobile display is awesome and easy to hold looks very classy. I played pubg game mobile did had any issues with the processing.If you put all protections like tamper glass and classy case cover your mobile will be safe if not there are easy chances for display scratches as it dont have a gorilla glass. I bought kapa silk smooth black case it fits perfectly to the phone.	5
2928	All in all a value for money product at the price I have got!	4
2929	Hello everyone ya it's mahi ... First A2 camera was nice but don't compare with Poco f1 and iPhone ... Performance was excellent most bo hanging and photos was excellent too specially for portrait mode .... But in this budget I will suggest only Poco f1 only .. waiting for another update also .. I am share with the potrait shots here	5
2930	Amazing Features Loaded Phone. Everything is perfect. Working Like a most premium phone of markt. Very Stylish & Impressive Phone. I am Old Huawei Fan So would definitely suggest everyone to get your hands on it. also got at fantastic deal from amazon & less than 24 hrs upon ordered i received the phone.	5
2931	Easily fits in hands.Potrait mode is very good.Battery life is good. 24-36 hours without charging in normal use.Non hybrid slot!!Touch response needs to be improved.Sound quality needs to be improved too.Back portion doesn't feel metallic.In same price bracket you can get a phone with better specs but without a dedicated sd card slot	4

2937	Battery Backup is very very low.......	1
2938	Picture quality overrated in so many reviews..i find it jusk ok in comparison to MI5.. since this mobile has stock android so you will not get the basic features of mobile like- gallery, three fingers screen shot,second space, double tap on screen to wake etc.. very disappointing.. also during video call you get your picture(caller's pic) very tiny and blurred and round shaped..i will say its just ok handset..only plus point is it comes with gorilla glass 5	1

2974	PROS:-1. screen quality good, 432 ppi make it really  crisp display2. easy to hold  in hand3. soc 625 is old but not useless even 2018 you will enjoy this, i  already installed and played most of the HD games available on play store  and those games play quite well4. moving on camera department we get 12+5 MP shooter which also performs well on daylight but however, it lags when it comes to night photography. we get video stabilizer too which give me a decent full HD video5. video and call quality is average.CONS:-1. at 11500 rs redmi should provide 4 GB of ram instead of 3 GB2. no miui 10 update3. we cant enjoy notch, seriously youtube, games, browsers do not show in notch only battery and time is displayed, so what's the point of the notch? at least they should give us an option to watch video on  fullscreen mode****** THE PHONE IS VERY SMALL COMPARE TO REDMI NOTE 5 PRO BUT IT FITS WELL IN HAND, OVERALL THE PHONE IS GOOD IF YOU GET IT BELOW 10 K THEN IT WILL BE KILLER DEAL, HOPE YOU READERS LIKE MY REVIEW, THANKS FOR READING , BYE :D	4

2994	stylish looks, superb display and works smoothly. Thanks to Amazon for nice diwali deal. I m loving the new phone	4
2995	Would Prefer vivo screen in a2.but over all it's best in this budget	5
2996	The technical specs on this device are standard issue compared to similar offerings from Moto, Asus, and Huawei. There is nothing standout about the design or construction either, but both are fine. What is interesting though is that this is the first unlocked Android One phone you can easily buy.Very interesting that Nokia is using Android One all all their new phones this year, but it looks like this is the only one that will officially be sold. Consumers that are tired of buying Android phones that never get updates (security or OS) should be paying attention.edit*After one month of using this device, I'd also like to point out some negatives to be fair.1. Call volume is a bit on the low side (I don't think software can fix this)2. The fingerprint sensor accuracy is mediocre. It takes some practice, and probably a few times setting up a finger to get it to reliably unlock on the first press (I don't think software can fix this).3. The default camera app is a mixed bag. I've had issues with auto-focusing, while others have had more serious problems (could be fixed with software update).I'd still rate it 4.5/5 stars though because the hardware is more than adequate for all but extreme demands, while the software is excellent, and updated every month. It's been a pleasure to have a Nexus...er Nokia phone again	4
2997	I bought this phone at 18k and satisfied with features. may be I paid a bit high amount but still this is worth	5
2998	battery life	5
2999	Awsome battery, camera is just fine but portrait mode is good, 2 sim slots with extra slot for SD card is simply awesome and the notch is a great deal. Thank you mi.	5
3000	Every thing is good	5
3001	I researched a lot before buying this phone as it was my 1st Honor phone. I compared with Mi note 5pro, poco F1, Samsung A7 and some honor phones themselves. I already have Mi Note 5 Pro.. but believe me i am loving using this phone. Its so easy to handle, lovely and premium design, screen size(very lil bezel) just give i-phone type look. Camera is good(i would give 3.5 stars) in daylight but very good in low light. Battery life is almost 2 days and processor is also very fast. Will definitely recommend buying this phone in the range below 20,000.	5
3002	Nice features	5
3003	Superb phone. Everything is very good. Please don't expect anything that's not mentioned in specification 😉	5
3004	Not so good as other products of Mi	2
3005	Battery life is good.Sound quality is perfect.Pictures are not ao good at the moment but we can expect better in future miui10 updates.Pubg is flawless.Looks beautiful.Good for this price range.	5

3022	Good mobile in low budget	5
3023	This Phone is basically for those who loves whole screen view. Screen is just awesome and you feel it when you see videos or pics.Face ID lock is no use as it does not work properly. Battery life is good, i can play games or watch video whole day without charging again.I must accept that other phones are available in Market has much more features in this range but edge to edge Screen you won't find in market in this price. 13 MP Camera is good but front camera is just OK not much worth. Over all i am satisfied with phone as i bought it in exchange in 11k.	4

3028	I am writing a review after 15 day of usage. This product from honor is awesome. I am very much satisfied with this. Some of the best points about this phone1. The very first feature that I love in it is the auto brightness feature. Which is calibrated very well. In a matter of seconds it detects and change the brightness.2. Build quality is top class3. Design is also top class.4. No heating. Yes it is true it has no heating issues. I tried this while downloading apps, youtube, camera, gaming. It gets a little bit warm but no heating5. Battery lasts for a complete day for a medium user. And for a casual user it could be 1.5 day too6. The unlock feature using face id. You dont have to press the power button. Just pick up the phone and give it a glance of your face. And it detect it really fast. I bet most of the user will not use fingerprint sensors in daytime.7. Night mode in the camera app works preety wellNow some of its negative points1. No type c port. But Comes with a 10 w charger which charges really well2. No eis in the phone. But video recording is not bad alsoBut I don't use my phone for recording videos so not an issue for me.So overall it is a must buy. Just go for it you will not be disappointed.It is going to be a blockbuster for honor	5
3029	Nice phone by Amazon camera , display,  backup good	5
3030	Camera is very disappointing feature of this device. No quality pictures, no electronic image stabilisation and other disappointing features is no type c port no fast charging. Other features and quality of the phone is good.	4
3031	Best mobile phone	5
3032	What status	4
3033	Budget phone with stylish looks,class and good material finish......loved it thank amazon for pre delivery.	4
3034	In this phone front camera is so bad and front flash not given which is costly at this price. Face unlock is slow other phone and back design building is too old his phone. I have changed in 15 days.	3
3035	Bought this is on sale.Let me sum it upCamera is mind blowing.Battery life is average.Even though It is part of the android one program but on the 11th day of the purchasing while restarting my phone the screen got stuck to Android One logo and hasn't recovered since. Read online apparently nothing can be done about it apart from taking it to the service center. Raises serious questions about MI devices c'mon it's not been even 2 weeks and I have to go to the service center to get the rectification done for some OS bug.	3
3036	Pros:Full view displayBatteryCons: There are manyCameraSoundNo dual Volte supportheavy weightand many more	3

3058	1. The most important feature of direct video calling is not available in this honor phone.Video calling possible only through third party app. This is main and pathetic failure of this phone.2. Saturation of pictures are very high.3. Video quality & picture quality is not upto mark as compare to same range of phones.	2

3067	Camera quality is not good in night.Very poor quality pixel	3
3068	Using the Honor 8x for nearly 1 month now. At first I would like to say about the design and build quality which is extremely beautiful and durable. The phone looks stunning in its blue colour and the notch display. Talking about the battery it's a decent one. Last for 1 day with normal usage. But under heavy usage need to be charged twice in a day. The charger provided in the box is not a fast charger but phone surprisingly gets charged pretty quick compared to other devices on this segment.The phones become warm at the back near the camera on prolonged use. Just warm a little bit nothing to worry about. The camera performance is decent enough at this price point.The ai mode works fine no problem. With various pro mode options and other features it's a great camera package at this price. The phone is smooth as of now. No lags. Just the FB app freezed for few seconds one time. No other issues. The phone is sleek enough and is a fingerprint magnet. So need to use a case. That's all for my Honor 8x review. U can definitely go with this device if it have trust on Honor.	4
3069	so many things I dislike in this phone, earlier i used MI Max is the best phone	3

3071	Excellent looks, but poor battery performance, with out using phone battery drain quickly, not a gaming phone,charging also very slow with original charger.	3
3072	This is one of the best phone in this budget. face recognition is an awesome feature they have povided. Apple buyers please rethink. Chinese mobile lovers this phone is made in india with high end hardware and display quality so dont even compare it with cheap products such as redmi or oneplus.Ratings:Display 10/10Ram 8/10Software updates and os optimization 10/10Processor 10/10Storage its 2 TB virtually unlited space.Nice product by LG.Here is my smartphone historyHtc oneplus miniOneplus one and then this one. LG q6 is really nice phone.	5

3076	I ordered it for review purpose in the first sale on 3rd May. I updated the device after first boot which added face unlock. Writing this review after 3 days of use.Pros:+ Good Build+ Beautiful Display+ Powerful Chipset+ Stock Android+ Lag Free Performance+ No Heating+ Massive 5000 mAh Battery+ Great Audio+ Decent Rear Cameras+ Dedicated MicroSD SlotCons:- Below Average Front Camera- No Quick Charging- No Type-C Port- Weird Camera Interface- No Case/Cover ProvidedRatings:...READ MORE	4
3077	The product reached on time. It is working fine . Camera quality is good. Battery life is decent. The phone is not meant for hardcore gameing. You can play pubg at low setting it will work great	5
3078	This product is worst product...don't buy	2
3079	not buy this phone when you call phone will start camara, phone go to on hold and many other thinks can open during call then i found proximity sensor problem in phone and company can't reply us to resolve this problem.	1
3080	Display of videos didn't impress much.Will get high Q pictures under natural bright light.Battery is draining slow since its new -need to observe for month or two.App switch and processing is extremely fast.	4
3081	not value for money	5
3082	SUPERB PHONE, NICE PICTURE QUALITY, BETTER SOUND & LONG LIFE BATTERY.	5
3083	Excellent phone and worthy. Battery could have been little better.	5

3086	Excellent phone with these features at this price, And performance is also good.	5
3087	Redmi is the  best	5
3088	Good phone in budget	5
3089	Bought this phone for my Dad and I am hoping it is built well and can withstand falls and scratches:-)Most of the apps needed upgradation and when upgraded the OS it started giving issues like volume buttons not working, device hung issues. After factory reset the issue somehow resolved. Asked for a tech visit from Amazon to check the device on 15th Oct(received the product on 11th OCT)..Good response from Amazon..Also Redmi puts screen cover (which makes it difficult to view the screen and needs to be removed) in the front and no temperred glass hence you need to go to the market to buy tempered glass which is not good. Also no headphones in the box.Front camera is not good but that's okay for a 10k phone. Also the design is not exciting compared to VIVO and OPPO full view phones.Overall good budget phone under 10k and if your priority is Full view screen and good RAM and processor.	4
3090	Heats much, Performance is dull , Screen is amazing, battery is amazing, Good sound quality, Good looks.	3
3091	camera quality not gud,  back and front	4
3092	Headphone isn’t detected. Abnormal behaviour of proximity sensor. The screen is turned on and off because of faulty proximity sensor. I didn’t expect such a phone from mi.	1
3093	Everything is okay ...the main problem is camera is camera quality is very poor ...pls don't buy it ....u will get another better phone in this range ...i talk to customer service ..they are unable to resolve that problem...so its just waste of money ...u are not able to return that product...	5
3094	Awesome Battery life, full hd screen and good sound quality	5
3095	I have been using Mi A2 from past one and a half week. So i will try to cover all aspects of the phone. I am medium to heavy user, play games for 30min daily and watch youtube videos and play songs.1. display 9/102. camera 9/103. Ram management 9/104. Os is clean with only feedback app.5. Processor is very good, no drop frames with pubg with medium settings. Will test with high settings as well.6. Sound output 10/10. Volume is very high.7. Camera bump comes out even after applying provided case so have to be careful with it.8. Battery backup is ok, will go for 20 hour with my usage. So good battery backup but not great.9. Red colour is eye catcher.	4
3096	Picture quality is good But sound quality is poor and bad the biggest problem is mi phone in sound then afyeraall battery life is too good.And i think mi all future is very good but sound quality is bad.	4

3174	This is my first MI phone purchase and being an Apple IPhone user ever since the first IPhone I wanted to try an android for a change. The packaging was very nice , but what surprised me was that the brand new phone has arrives with “stains around the camera lenses and upper part of the rear metal body”. I still have to get a new SIM and startup the phone to update this review on the phone performance. The screen quality looks really good so I am hoping the rest of the usage experience will be betterThe phone comes with a basic silicone case, adaptor cord to connect a wired headphone to the USB Socket, a small charger and USB C charger cable, instruction leaflet.	4

3233	Looks classy the only positive thing I can say!...not a Worth of it's price. Will never buy Moto from now onwards	3
3234	Rear camera - overall picture quality is very bad specially indoor and artificial light pictures are totally useless. The images are very soft low contrast and lack detail.Front Camera - I don't know why it is there, pathetic.Good battery, other performance also satisfactory.	1
3235	Picture quality: GoodSound: GoodBattery: Good	4
3236	I have used oneplus6 and would say that this phone is totally a value for money.One thing better than oneplus is the form factor of this phone. It is comfortable to use in one hand.Picture quality is good.Sound quality is also good.Battery life lives is moderate.The red colour is not exactly a bright red it's more of a blood red that would look good in hands.No cons for this phone.	5
3237	All things are Best  and battery life is very long and long.	5
3238	Very good phone , battery is very good , camera is ok , very stylish , we can buy this phone worthful.BATTERY - I thought whether it will fulfill battery problems , but really 100 percent charge stands for 2 days with moderate usage of Internet.CAMERA - Back camera is nice with good portrait mode , during night time ok .  Front camera is good @ daylight , during night its ok.DISPLAY - Very great display and nice clear view with 432 ppi density.Sound quality - Ok for me , but need more efficiency for song lovers.	5

3247	Overall a good performerWith camera and hardware / software.Battery ok I've been using from one month.Max 8 to 10 hours for average user.For deep diggers  6 to 7  only.Problem with ambient sensor while using Phone call.Pie also updated.... let's check how it balancing battery performance in next review	4
3248	Nice stuff, its a change from the several samsungs i have used from note to note 5.I wanted a change to experiment a different manufacturer.The screen is large for the phone so small.The bezels are negligible.The phone is midpriced but feels high range.android 7.1.1 and it is expected to go to oreo as soon as possible.U can also consider lg 6 plus or lg 8 , but i have no complaints about this one.Unfortunately it doest not have rapid charging. That is a minus.Takes some time to charge from 20 to 100 percent.	5

3321	Phone is perfect now at this price bracket without any competitors around as companies own MI A1 permanently discontinued. Coming to verdict- my opinion the phone should be priced at 13000/- during launch. As first few batches come impoted from China henceforth the price. Made in China with manufactured during January. So the question arises how Mi sold 3 lakh phones actually they have not. As always the screen has lots of stack/dead pixels, not really noticed unless you are in full brightne...READ MORE	4

Very thin bezels the 18:9 ratio does the Job well,2. Face Lock/unlock technology works like charm, its very responsive and easy to use.3. The most important plus point in this phone is it has Pure DUAL SIM and Memory card slot too. so we can use all 3 at same time.4. Battery performance is superb, camera is awesome Wide-angle, Display is crisp and sharp.Cons: Didn't found any :DOverall a very bang on a Budget phone. Congrats LG..you have done it :)	5

3361	Excellent Mobile. Best for Day to Day Usage! No Heating Problem and Display is Awesome.	5
3362	Mi A2 is a good phone, though not bezel less this phone has a good aspect ratio . The screen is great, better than Note 6 Pro I might add. Though it has only 4gb ram , this may be a problem for tech lovers but Android One gives a big advantage that it gives around 3- 2.7 gb RAM free always as compared to MIUI which is very heavy on a phone.Pictures are a lot better than Note 6 Pro because of Google's photography algorithms. Front camera is amazing . Battery backup is quite good works all day with Wifi on and games, I am impressed. All in all a good combo of Xiaomi with Google's Android One.	4
3363	Happy with the battery.. Camera not upto mark... Not happy with camera picture quality.. Processing is little slow.	3

3421	Nice product with old Processor.	4
3422	One of the best budget phones I've been using this phone since a month or two I have not experienced any lag over heating and the battery life is also amazing the charging speed is also fabulous because it supports lightning charging with c-type wire the camera quality is also amazing but the night camera is slightly blurry at times but for this price it's just superb. Screen resolution is also quite good compared to many other phone like Vivo and oppo Huawei is an international brand also soo I would recommend to you to go for this phone as it can easily beat any high-end phone in performance and but this phone is not for gaming but you can run high-end games on this mobile like pub-g with medium or low graphics unfortunately it doesn't support Fortnite though by performance it is just amazing.	5

3477	"Those who are confused in buying this phone. Let me tell you it has got awesome display better than even one plus 3 in this price point at 15k. Even the rear camera has 1/3"" sensor and able to capture good photos in every light condition (don't use lg camera app it has auto focusing issues so either use tap to focus or any other app) lg may update its app. You won't regret buying it.Ram management is not good for gamers but for casual work its good.Output from audio jack is ever better than moto phones.I have used turbo charger and it fast charges the phone (its nearly 30min faster)Selfie lover stay away low light performance of front camera is avg. Go buy oppo allah hu akbar edition hahah xDSpeaker output is good even the earpiece works as speaker for stereo effect.Build is rock solid.Battery SOT is 5:30-6:00 hrs which is good considering its slimness and 28nm chipset.Its looks steals the show 😌😌Ui is smooth.Overall its a good package from a reputed brand.I just hope if it had fp sensor and nfc then it will be a perfect device.For those who are complaining about heating issue just switch off sync for me now its cooler. But it just warms like other phones it don't overheats.If you are facing problem of loose headphones inserted in jack. Then press it harder i was facing the same untill they are fully inserted in the jack"	5

3481	Product is good in the view of camera and all the features. Dual volte is the ultimate feature.But the phone is unable to access the memory card, when you set the default storage as memory card, even if you take the 05 sec video also, phone is unable to store the data to memory card and with in seconds the device is going into blank condition.I can clearly say that, that is not the memory card problem, because the same memory card is getting good access and good functioning in other mobiles.So, after knowing this i formatted my memory card and tried take store the another video file by setting the storage as default location memory,but again it is showing the same blank condition.Disappointed due to direct storage issue	1
3482	Average good	4
3483	It was working fine till yesterday, till I received complaints from a few callers that they were unable to hear me.

When you press power button you need to wait 20 sec to see the screen.4 when your phone call is done, you need to wait till others cut the call as you may not see the screen immediately after phone call.5 replaced my phone 2 times in Hope of solving 3 and 4.  No use.  So the product itself is corrupt not just my piece of phone6 . Even after all kinds of troubleshoots by me and technician.  Basic issues not solved. So returned my phone even though I love its features and looks , it has serious ’screen goes blank' issues.We always click power button to unlock our phone.. but when you click power button it takes at least 20 seconds to show you screen.. just try to wait 20 seconds on any phone for unlock and if you are okay, this is the best phone in recent times in this budget. :-) all the best	2

3532	Better life note bud bad backuo	1
3533	well after using for 18 days, I would say the phone looks great. The screen looks awesome and the form factor is slim, the face recognition works well most of the times. Phone works average overall in performance and the camera quality is not good.It did survive the fall on concrete from waist height, thanks to its great built.However it heats up on data usage especially on the sides and also the strength of signal reception is not good, hence three stars.***	3

3547	This phone is really good.Style: It is handy, easy to carry and sleek with a good grip.Screen: the resolution is amazing. It feels like a high end phone with a 19:9 screen ratio. Responsive touch qualityCamera: Rear camera is amazing but front camera could have been better in this era of selfies.Accessories: The clear case in the box is awesome and suits my phone and gives a good grip.Overall, this phone is great in this range and has only one con and that is it's front camera which is only 5MP.	4
3548	Unlike other Redmi mobiles, it sometimes lagging. Battery backup was very good. Easy to hold but video display size is little smaller because it's not as wide as mobile screen. Mobile Network (I'm using jio)reception is not that good.	4

3621	After two weeks usage below are my observation;Camera quality is good specially the selfie one front camera is very impressive. Very light weight, slim, handy and comfortable.Battery back is not up to the expectation, lagging behind with other competitors with same price. Performance wise also not up to the mark, when you compare it with other models like Note 5 pro.Little more effort is expected from brand like Huawei specifically with battery life and performance.	3

3704	The phone is good refered to its price range. The camara is ok just ok. Battery life is not that great wished to see a type c charger in 2k18.	5
3705	I feel some sotf features are not available in this phone which are even available in some low range phone.features like date speed showing, screen double tape to screen awaking, screen shot soft key with cropping options, SIM inserted donot has feature to edit/ enter mobile number, sensor blinking on receiving new message/missed call. I missed all these features because all these features were available in my previous phone (lenevo k3 note) which is of very economical price.I must expected all these minimum features from big brand like Samsung during his next OS system upgrade.Thank youregards	4
3706	Overall very good phone, value for money	4
3707	Data Network fluctuations throughout daytime. When data connection switch off for 1-2 hr during daytime or at night, later again switch on but 4g connection or data is not getting connected unless it is restarted. This issue i faced with 2 different MI A2 mobile. When i purchased in first week of Nov2018, i faced this issue, so i replaced it. New MIA2 received in 3rd week of Nov, but same issues i faced. This time Amazon return my money. So don't go with MIA2 specially Jio user.	1

3711	I Just using this phone for 7to8 days only and O honoured to say that it's amazing device I ever had.Now let's dig in,If you guys are looking for a premium look and build quality then go for this.Undoubtedly it's the best ever premium budget phone.It's have a decent performance over I high end camera that Huawei do.I ensure you will find better choice than this device but believe me it's a Badboy in it's segment.Pros :Good build qualityGreat CameraGreat Interface but short of bugsGood performancePocket friendly and ✋ y DeviceCons:Decent battery lifecycle (you need to charge this device twice a day)Few software bugs ( like Lockscreen notifications are always hidden)There is need to buy fitted glass and cover because company not preapplied this.Overall am satisfied with this combo that Tech giant Huawei given.I attach some shots over it's 📷 . Hope you like that.	5

3720	Simply Wowsome	5
3721	Battery backup is totally ridiculous instead of mi note 5 pro software functions not good	1
3722	The worst phone. I have been waited for 4 month to by this phone. And i order it in first sale. I was so excited for this phone. But after getting it i felt like fooled.They are promoting this on the name of camera. But in reality camera is not that good. It's little bit okk in sun light for outside pic. But the low light pictures are worst. And if you will take pic of open space, all the around things is notat all visible clearly.They are saying it's SD 660 processor. But speed is not up to the mark. Even note 5 pro is working faster than this phone.	1
3723	Quality of mobile is good,  but not good mobile picture quality.	3
3724	Not a good product ..its hardly a month when I started using headphones and one of the earphones is not working...i have tried connecting amazon customer care people but there is no way I am able to connect with me ..they direct me to app..I don't know where to find options to file a complain... accessories are under 6 month guarantee but what is the use if one cannot find means to avail it	1

3730	Amazing pictures, decent sound and battery.Typically last full day with sporadic music, browsing, photography and voice calls.	4
3731	The phone gets restart automatically	3
3732	i will never buy anythin from MI again for their phone have lots of privacy concerns, we struggled to get around those but the phone won't even be used without agreed to their clauses.so i simply gave it to someone who will happily take clicks, browse fb and do whatsapp, and will ensure none of MI's any apps are used.the presence of new android is good yo take away permissions from apps. but not the default ones, which we simply do not uae and block those from internet access.otherwise okay for use. but not good when used by people who know less about nuance of uwing auch devices	3
3733	I'm posting this based on my last seven days of usageExcellent build quality with reasonable priceFelt best in the segmentPerformance is good and there is no lagYou can load up to 6 to 10 apps at a time and you will not observe any lagging.Battery performance and optimisation is really goodThere is no draining of batteryBattery will be more than enough for a full day usageCamera gives you a decent clarity and some best pictures at a very good lighting conditions.Very handy to use use and it is not bulkierThanks to the designCalling  and network reception quality is exceptionalDual volte works great and smoothHisten audio effects for headphones are impressive please activate it while using your headphonesSumming up it is a great phone and worth the buyDefinitely go for it you will be surprised with it's quality	5
3734	Good phone at this price, camera takes good pictures, display is lovely, over all it is a best product from honour, I am using this for 3 days and it's working superb, you should by this product it is better then redmi note 5 pro	5

Below are my observations.One, excellent camera. Two, excellent build quality. Three, excellent looks. Four, latest Android one. Five, never hanged so far. Six, sufficient volume. Seven, excellent graphics. NFC is the icing on the cake!I'll post a long term review after 3 to 4 months of usage! So far, expectations met! Happy!	5
3761	Camera is a slight low key. The rest of the phone is superb in this range	4
3762	Very good device	5

3768	"""picture quality is awsm"",sounds quality good"",battry life is also good"""	5
3769	Massive display, full HD, excellent design, superior build quality, way more features than you can expect at this price range for a mid range phone, truly worth the price. But let me use it for sometime so that I can certify the performance. Plastic back cover quality is very bad. White powders coming after few weeks use.	5
3770	Btry is good game performance good ND looking asummmm phone	5

3772	Nice speed, camera, sound and performance in. Surely any one can buy it.	5

3788	Don't go for this not even huawei & honorthey dont value customer.bought it in the first day of its release in india,utterly disappointed.poor performence, poor battery backup, rubbish UIwe cant use it only for its look and camerain this price you can buy a flagship in Xiaomi (POCO F1)its not even comparable to Redmi note 5 Pro.fingerprint censor lacks to perform,Face unlock totally waste.Please dont waste ur money its a absolute rubbish.	1
3789	Corning Gorilla glass 5 is the icing on the cake...	5

3801	Camera quality is somewhat low as told in specifications it is about 8megapixel	5
3802	The mobile is value for money, if u want all latest features in a budget then u can go with this mobile !!	5
3803	I used sony from Z1 to XZ1. Then they launched xz2 which was completely out of my range. And I found it idiotic to spend 70k on a smartphone. So after a little bit of research I bought this one. Its been 3 months and I just love this. And its was just 20k. and its just gorgeous. Tiny, thin and glossy	4
3804	Very bad picture quality is bad bad screen no big screen screen quality low ratio is low bad ever worst ever Redmi product I really hated this phone	2
3805	Phone is good but its battery backup is not more than 7 hour when full utilies	4
3806	colour: Gold; 3G -32 GB; screen edge curved hence screen guard doesn't cover entire screen. Sound quality better than Redmi 3S, Redmi 4. Display resolution good. Battery life 3+ days with internet (5-6 hrs/day).	4
3807	I used this phone for one month. I am so satisfied. No hanging or signal problem. It is sutable for users make call, browse, watcj movies and hear songs. Not for gamers... Charge lasts for one day. Great phone for medium price range. Go for life's good :)	5
3808	Loved LG Q6Display is awesome and infinite.Battery back last for more yhan 10hrs.Camera has true colours.	5

3819	Nice phone with good build . Everything is good except camera . This Phone contains Dual Camera 12+5 but still it is not that good .	4
3820	Picture quality not good. Problem with full screen mode. Doesn't work with Android auto.Overall average in this price range.	3
3821	Phone looks good, battery life is standerd, overall it good phone	4
3822	Overall redmi 6 pro is very good product.highly recommend....	5
3823	Once for all awesome phone loved it..	5
3824	Pros:1. I bought this phone in lightning deal for 8999! For that price it is more than value for money.2. The screen view is just beautiful. The user interface is very good.3. I don't remember the phone hanging.4. The display is a treat to eyes.5. Sound quality of both speaker and headphones is good.  Note: One needs to use decent headphones to get the best out of this phone. I use Audio Technica M40x so the combo sounds good to my ears.6. Oreo 8.1 update! Updates for LG phones come real fast. I received Oreo update for this phone a month before my wife's moto G5s plus phone.7. Lightweight and Slim.8. Second most convenient way of unlocking phone. double tap on screen.9. Preinstalled smart doc app to take care of your cache. No need to install additional CCleaner kind of software to clean junk.Cons:1. The processor is slightly on slower side.2. Its camera also is not  upto the mark. I would rather say average.3. Battery is non-removable. But fortunately I never felt the need of it, as the phone never hanged nor I had any other battery related issues.4. Back cover gets easily scratched, biggest dis advantage i feel. The phone looks good but one can't keep it without backcover.5. No Finger Print sensor.. but that issue is partially taken care by the screen type. double tap on the screen to lock or unlock it.6. No missed call or message alert light on the screen. I had it on my earlier Micromax phones so I miss it. It was useful.	4
3825	Phone is hanging a lot	3
3826	The best handset comes in 5.5 lg had set the bench mark of fullvision display or full hd plus display with true picture & natural color.Best in its class with 435 snapdragon proccesor.	5
3827	Best Camera	5
3828	CONS:It having higher heating issue at volume button side when u use ur phone at high brightness and also using data connections.Camera:Rear is good but only in bright light not for low light conditions. Front camera is also have heavy noise in picture and it is below avg.PROS:Performance:It gives good performance and no lags in any conditions.Display:It is very amazing display. It is only big advantage.Not worth for 15000.	3
3829	screen size small	3
3830	I used it for two months. I didn't find. works smoothly. I love it.	5
3831	Pura pura din mobile mey rohege tou truck ki battery b khatam hogi paglu. Mobile ko mobile ki tarah use karo aur kaam pe dhyan do.	5
3832	A good product from Lg . Though some minor issues like fingerprint reader and heating issues do exist but i feel its a best buy with such good offers of exchange.Also a bigger factor is that its not CHINESE.	5
3833	Could not be dilivered because delivery boy was unaware of the exchange product which was oppo neo 7 technical name oppo A33f he was not ready to take the product because the handset was showing a33f though IEMI no was verified	1
3834	Awesy phone	5
3835	Friends don't buy Amazon site pee this phone Touch and speaker prablam over heating image quality is low	1
3836	Beautiful phone. Got it for 8k during diwali sale with an old phone exchange. Totally worth it	5
3837	Receiver, mic stopped working within a month! what a load of crap!The battery life is awesome and hands down its better than my old samsung 8 edge. But what to do with a phone where you cannot hear anything even on earphone unless you switch on speaker?If i can someone, i cant hear the ring too until i switch on speaker.Only bluetooth headphones are working to talk to somone! Shouldn't have bought it.Go help yourself and Google all redmi 6 pro problems before you buy.I wish i had done that!	1
3838	This mobile is amazing but u might disappoint bit with picture quality of screen while watching videos	5
3839	Awsome Prodct...Suprb Blue...Makes feel royal..	5
3840	Perfect low budget phone	4
3841	Good 1	4
3842	Mobile looking gud but camera not gud	3
3843	Front camera not up to the mark.	4
3844	It's good. But not recommend for camera lovers.	3
3845	Amazon disappoints this time with a not-so-good product at a not-a-right price during its festival sale.	2
3846	Nice screen phone in this budget	5
3847	Nice model	4
3848	Camera only well otherwise too bad use compare to redmi note 4 and 3s prime... Battery backup worst.this is first produced i write review.	1
3849	i am so,worried.,	1
3850	Not as I wished to be and it should have some unique features in it so think before purchasing of it	1
3851	Very good smartphone	5
3852	After 5 days of use  :Camera both front and back superb. No need for further processing for selfies.Nice display and fast fingerprint unlock.speaker is very loud.Decent Battery lasting full day. battery drainage problem got solved. To get full day battery , go to mobile network under settings and select any one mobile data if you are using dual sim in the mobile.This one is nice upgrade to Mi A1 with better processor, cameras , graphics, display size etc.  It battery almost similar to Mi A1.	5
3853	I like the notch display and look of the mobile very much..posh look👌👌No need to worry about battery life its great for 3000mah stands like 4000mah battery..and cam was superb both rear and front👌	5
3854	Everything's good about this device	5
3855	When I start camera it's starts some black lining	2
3856	Its all things very good its cheep price but good feature	5
3857	Full vision display is great... In this price range must buy	5
3858	Battery good other wise all quality poor	4
3859	Front camera worst it's look like prism app pics in normal mood  and rear camera also over brightness	1
3860	Best forever	5
3861	Battery to good.	4
3862	Great 😘😘	5
3863	Nice phone got it within 1day after order	5
3864	Nice .....cam not good	4
3865	Big screen, double camera, sleek body, battery is also good.it's good for me.But a good body cover or flap cover should be there with such #only_on_ Flipkart mobiles.READ MORE	5
3866	Excellent looks very smooth & fastBut one minor issue some apps not good working in full screen mode	4
3867	What a phone .... A handy epic phone.....MI at its Best ....Love from MI Fan 😍😍	5
3868	Honor 8 X Design differentiates itself from others in this Price Segment, It is of a glossy dual-tone design that makes the glass back look and feel premium, However it is recommended to use the soft TPU case which is bundled in the box to avoid scratches. Another highlight of the Honor 8X is its impressive 91 percent screen-to-body ratio with a much smaller bottom chin with 19.5:9 screen on the front, with a small notch on top, and minimal borders all around. Even though the Screen is 6.5 inch this phone is relatively slim at about 7.8mm.The Honor 8X comes with software-based face recognition. It registers your face in a jiffy and is quiet fast, Not only does this phone look good, it performs great for its price thanks to the new HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC, However the Google Messages App which is bundled is not as user friendly and also not that fast in response. Would definitely recommend the Mobile at this Price Point, It is Value For Money.	5
3869	Phone is very good	5
3870	Honor has stepped up the game for all budget phone makers. The display and the designs are magnificent on the honor 8x. The premium feel in hand and just the right size makes you feel in love with the phone. The battery lasts for 1 day tops to be frank and the camera couldve been better as well.. However night modes and well lit objects can be captured with decent quality on the honor 8x. The voice and call quality are superb with low SAR value. If you are on a budget of 15k this would definitely be my choice..otherwise go for one plus 6t if you want the pros of honor 8x with good camera as well..	5
3871	Very good product. Good camera, good UI, swift response time, performance is also great for the price. Only concern, the battery drains out pretty quick.	4
3872	Picture quality: It's the Best camera phone in this price range...The pictures are very clear and colours in the images are Excellent...It's better than I phone X camera...I bought it very Prayerfully and it's a Gift from my GOD..!! Bcoz i bought this phone at 13000/- instead of 17500/- on Amazon Great Indian Festival..Sound quality:- The sound quality of the Mi A2 is Very loud and Crystal clear in my opinion..The 3.5 mm Jack is removed but I'm not disappointed because I bought boAt Bluetooth headphones and I didn't feel that the Jack is removed..Battery Life:- The battery Life is also awesome to me in this price range..It really gives me 1 nd half day nd I'm really happy about it..And if I use heavily it gives me Approximately one day...So, battery Life is also good..!!The total review of the Mi A2 is :- Expectations reached and Heart's desire fulfilled..!!😇Than you Mi and Amazon..!!😊	5
3873	The product appears awesome only on paper. the camera does not meet the expectations. i think the OS is not optimised we get much more quality pics from note 5 pro. bluetooth headphones wrks perfect but wired headphones didnot sound well. battery lasts for a day on average use. everyone goes for this phone seeing the camera config, but trust me guys note 5 pro takes much better shots.	3
3874	camera bad colouring	2
3875	Overall good...Battery backup, Picture quality would've better bt this price range it's quite good...Anyone Can go for it if you have budget under 11k..	5
3876	Good not a best	4
3877	To good	5
3878	battery life is awesome and it is a one hand use phone which is having good compact design and display with notch makes its look even better.	5
3879	purchased 16 days back ...it is a usual phone. hang at the time of call ...i want to replace it but the returning time is only for 10  days	3
3880	5Mind-blowing purchase	5
3881	Picture quality averageSound irritativeBattery life awesom	3
3882	Looking good	4
3883	brilliant phone very good battery backup and display very good I'll love mi thankio amazon	5
3884	Very good phone with amazing battery life.I got phone in 24 hours thanks Amazon for fast delivery .	5
3885	Slow and not up to the mark	3
3886	Not bad product	4
3887	Camera not working	1
3888	Product good battery life low	4
3889	Good but Xiaomi needs to improve performance of the phone comapared to my  old phone sound and battery are good.	4
3890	great phonephone look and design are excellent.i love this phonecamera is very good.better then vivo v9.	5
3891	Excellent phone, the look of it is awesome. Metallic body is strong and sturdy.The OS performance is extremely good	5
3892	This is the worst device. The battery life is very bad. According to the Blancco app by Amazon, the device temperature was 44°C and the customer executive asked to keep aside for 5-10 mins and use it later. Very bad experience.	1
3893	LG should think about their pricing. It should not be so much costly without the features like dual camera, fingerprint scanners etc..	2
3894	Phone Is Very Good	4
3895	Nice Phone at this Price Point... Looks stylish, Handy and Premium in Hands! Even though it not equipped with LIECA lens as in P20, the picture quality is really superb.The only Cons is the Battery is not upto the mark as its 3000 Mhs it drains fast in VoltE! Rather than the battery performance everything is upto the Mark..	5
3896	Takes very good pictures.  Battery life is also very good. Headphone jack is missing, and the adapted provided is not convenient to carry around. Difficult to mount on a selfie stick because the volume rocker and power buttons are both on one side. Have received the latest Android update to Pi.	4
3897	Mobile overheating while call and while using any application. please advise how to replace or return.	1
3898	Osm phone lg is make first time for custmer briliant phone 18:9 full vision worlds first	5
3899	Good phone but don't need factory default apps.	4
3900	Very happy😄😃😁	4
3901	ProsAll are nice  exceptCons1 camera not so good2. Both sim are volte but not true volte so u can't use both 4g sim simeltinuously	5
3902	Bad camera, both front and back. Extremely bad in low light and indoor lighting conditions.Potrait is pathetic. Image stabilization is poor.Feeling disappointed, No MIUI 10 update till date. Phone is not worth the money.Also no gorilla glass protection and it has outdated processorPlease dont buy this phone. Because you will regret later	1
3903	Awesome picture quality in both front and back mode. Sound quality is good in headset. Battery life is good and lasts upto 40 hrs.	4
3904	I bought the phone as a gift for my father. The phone started out as being great while using. Great camera and interface. But right now, the phone lags A LOT when even using simple functions like calls and messages. It takes well over 30-40 seconds for the phone to process between a contact being clicked and the call being connected, and almost a minute for the screen to display what is going on. Composing a message, starting the camera and waiting for it to process the clicked image is equally delayed and slow. Other apps in the phone are affected by this lag as well. I expected that buying a good mobile phone from a reputable website like Amazon would be a good buy. But this is not the case. This is a big loss to me in terms of money and the effort put into using it.	2
3905	Getting hanged frequently	1
3906	Screen size is very handy and screen quality is superb, fast in everyday tasks. Recommend it after three months of use.	5
3907	phone is good but Android a1 updates not fully supporting and service center technician s are not professional. amazon response is not good if you are in problem or raise change request. buy at own responsibility	3
3908	Front camera is average...Not a bad not a good	4
3909	Awesome phone. Smooth in use. Quality of the phone is good.	5
3910	Good phone im6 pro	5
3911	nice phone & great service	4
3912	1 minus point memory card slot not avlbl	5
3913	Battery life is average. Picture quality is good, some more camera features of Google pixel 2 could have made it a better camera phone with Android one . Got effectively at 12500/-  that much only it should worth.Not able to use headphones while charging is major drawback for me.	4
3914	This is a serious review for ppl planning to buy LG q6.Though ppl appreciated its look and performance,i would like to mention here that yes definitely it is,but battery backup is a huge concern.Its worst than all the phones i have seen till the time.The battery drains so quickly that you will always wonder whats wrong with it and even people around you will say that i find your phone always on charging.The level is this much.And for charging it takes around 3 to 3.5 hrs to get fully charged.When i got this phone i even contacted LG regarding charging time,they mentioned like no it will take this amount of time only.So pls drop your plan to buy this.Its a serious suggestion from me.	1
3915	I didn't received bill and warranty in box.	3
3916	I like the performance	5
3917	It's not have option call recording and face unlock	5
3918	Very gd phone	4
3919	Not for Gaming! It's great for day to day usage!No device is perfect, every device has its own flaws... And Honor 8x is not an exception. But Over all, it's great device for me. I love its looks! Immersive big display. Great for multimedia consumption.Battery wise Good.Loving it.	3
3920	It's nice to buy	4
3921	Nice product.  Delivery guy also.	4
3922	Very Fast...Amazing device... Awesome.Love it	5

3929	Redmi 6 Pro is a nice & superb.	5
3930	👍👍👍👍	5
3931	Battery life was big mistake in MI A2 mobile phones	4
3932	Great design.good looks.stunning display.there's a bit lagging while playing high end games like pubg and the most worst part is the network connection.very poor connection and even though the carrier network is speed enough the phone can't catch up the speed .Very slow internet connection	3
3933	Its reali Nice	5
3934	Comparitively with Samsung phone with same price range, i felt bad to purchase this phone,i am totally unsatisfied with this phone	3
3935	Worth 2 buy badget... Sexy looking model....	5
3936	Lowest price and good camera quality	5
3937	The battery life is not good, it drains very fast even in regular use forget about gaming and watching videos..	4
3938	Picture quality is very pretty and stock Android is awesome as always.	5
3939	I liked the phone for the price i purchased...i got this phone on exchange offer  just a week back.I liked the phone for the money . Camera quality of this phone is is not that great compared to single cam samsung Galaxy S7 phone. tough this phone has dual cam.Apart from the camera quality every thing else is awesome 7 worth for money..Just annoyed by the ad in MI app...if MI reduce this in their inbuilt apps and keep official app ad free it will be very good	4
3940	Essential Applications like Google Play store, File Manager Doesn't work	1
3941	Quality phone for given price	5
3942	very handy phone and very good display with good audiorear cam day light its nice but in night not like the nexus 5 whicdh was made by LG beforefront cam totally fooled off saying 5mpanother important thing getting heated well with routine useiam still in dilemma to retun it or not	3
3943	Update lattest android	4
3944	+ves.Good displayUnique in this budget.Less bezel display looks good.No software lagging.Premium look.-vesAverage battry & cameraSome time heating problem.Conclusion.Buy it if you dont prefer camera and finger print scanner.	4

3966	Battery is too GoodBut Camera quality is not Good.	4
3967	Very good phone for the price but what a horrible proximity sensor issue. Every time you make a call, the speaker or flashlight or mute button will be pressed and its annoying. I really hope they fix it with the software update.	1
3968	Design and built are speechless! Display is awesome the only thing which worries is its battery...and face recognition is useless as its slow, nothing can replace fingerprint sensor.. Overall its a good phone..	4

4105	This phone is awesome.A perfect combination of price and features.Camera quality is perfect.Both cameras click very high quality image.	5
4106	Received this unit during great sale event and in exchange of my existing phone. Delivery and exchange experience was excellent as usual.About Phone:The basic requirement for a new phone for me was to have a phone of smaller size (to be able to operate in one hand most of time), long battery life, larger RAM & Storage, standard physical protection (for usual scratches & small bumps) and no heating problem during long calls. I use this phone for official number in which long calls are quite usual.I am generally satisfied with the phone as it meets most of the above criteria. Battery life usually is about 2 days (around 2 hrs of total call time, some youtube videos, whatsapp, sms, etc.). However, it seems that the screen is not having any protection. It got scratched in first week of usage without any single hard bump or scratching.The phone loudspeaker is average at best; can't use it in a noisy environment at all. Call on speaker is ok in a quite location. It is not at all suiting for any quality music playing.Another unexpected issue is the Camera quality. Though the rear camera is a two-camera set-up, but the quality of the images, especially a little low light conditions are very bad. Also, there is no macro mode. Minimum distance is about 1.5m. Front camera is even worse. The quality of the selfies are actually worse than 2 year older phones.The MIUI 10 is yet to be updated. From the general information available in the market it is understood that it should get quite few important upgrades.The phone is generally value for money as a phone (for calls, SMSs, Whatsapp, etc.). But if one is looking for a media device, it would be better to look for alternatives.	4
4107	Everything is fine but battery back up is very poor	5
4108	Best Budget phone	5

4121	Hi everyone, i gifted this ph to my dad as an retirement gift n you know what these days we all want many features like a big battery dual camera etc as an youngster but seriously for a retired man he was in need of features which can ease his day to day work by helping him... like now he dnt look for remote of tv or ac b'coz he can use his ph either .... even battery is quite good for him, he spends most of his time in streaming n having long video call with his friends... and in the end now he captures all of those moments... perfectly.... which he wanted too.....	5

4199	Defectect mobile device	1
4200	Satisfied, with the product,	5
4201	I got this product and face below issue in 4 days.1) Couple of times the Phone gives a ECHO to the Listener on the other end and couple of time to me also.2) The charger get hot when you keep it on charging.Other issues.1) I was using Asus Zenphone2 of 2015 Model with same ram and Internal Memory,but this phone is really very slow in loading web pages an even your tube.2) The network keeps on fluctuating.Badluck:I got in the trap of Amazon Policy saying that we cannot get refund , we can only give replacement. I would request all the user to kindly be careful when you are buying the product. Amazon very smartly mention at only one place that you can get only replacement and not refund.So the user has not other option left just to get the product replace.Conclusion for me.I can only pray that the product work atleast for 1 year and the replace product doesn't have the technical issue and i dont have to run behind the service center.I will definitely AVOID buying products from Amazon. Save  my money as I was planning to go for Prime membership.	1

4210	Good mobile.Little bit heating issue during long use of camera.Screen resolution and size is out of box.I rated 1 star only because of poor delivery services. Delayed after commitment.Totally disopinted.	1
4211	Received Defect Product. Camera not even gets open. Now requested for replacement	1
4212	Overall good mobile, but if someone is looking for a good front camera (selfie lover) please avoid this. The pictures from the the front camera are pathetically grainy and does not match to the level of 5 MP.	2
4213	Awesome camera and superior performance by pure android OS. At this price point, this is a beast! The color red is a steal!!	5

Batter does not last a full day but with battery saver on from the start it can manage.Pros:Front CameraDurabilityDisplaySpeakerAndroid OneMediocre:PerformanceBack CameraCons:BatteryPosition of Fingerprint scannerFINAL VERDICT:It is a nice phone but slightly overpriced.I will prefer Nokia 6.1 plus as it is available now.	4

4238	Received the phone yesterday. Here is my quick feedback:Pros:1) Great camera. Both rear and front camera is excellent. It has slow motion and time lapse capabilities.2) Quick charge3) Excellent processor snapdragon 660. Fast and optimized.4) Fluid stock android experience.Cons:1) Battery capacity could have been more. Although it is pretty much optimized and for me last a full day2) Absence of 3.5mm port may be an issue for some users. But not a problem for me because i prefer using Bluetooth headphones.3) No SD card slot might be an issue for few users.	5

4273	My Honest Review after a month of usage.Pros:1. Good Slim Design2. Notch Display3. Image Resolution4. 4 Camera Options5. Decent BatteryCons:1. Its very disappointing as no 4G Video Calling facility is available. You have to use third party apps like Whatsapp or Duo etc which uses your internet.2. Charging speed is bit low as compare to other 20K range mobiles.3. The provided silica pouch makes a foggy kind of white prints at the back of the mobile pouch which shows like the mobile is poorly maintained.4. Type C – USB would have been a better choice instead of this micro USB.	3
4274	Hang	3
4275	Pro's1.Good display2.Good battery life(1 to 1.5 days on heavy usage) (7 to 8 hrs of screen on time)3.Good rear camera4. No heating issues5.Excellent design and build qualityCon's1. Below average sound(only the volume is low..the quality is ok'ish)2. Average battery charging time(roughly around 2 to 2.5 hours)3. Average front facing camera(portrait has extra blurry effect)4. No idea about the glass protection)It's a good phone to buy in this price range.. You can go for it because it's a good looking device.	4

4288	I gave gift to my mother and she is not heavy user.she gave me feedback that this phone got slower with storage filling.i check myself it is got slow with update and storage filling to 80%.i literally don't recommend this phone either invest money on MI A2. that one is better with stock android.After a month use i found the problem..if u hold phone just by top corners ur screen will be wiped off. This phone has serious issue	1
4289	Good product thank you #redmi such a good Android phone camera is too goodBuild quality better for other phones	5
4290	4.5 out of 5	4
4291	Design and look	5
4292	"Initially I had mixed opinion about Mi A2. The picture quality (main USP of the phone) was great, but the battery life was pathetic. It would just last 10-12 hours with just 4 hours of SOT.But after a couple of cycles I understood the battery draining problem.Basically it's the dual 4G VOLTE device. So by default the ""data"" and ""enhanced 4G LTE mode""is turned on  for both the SIM.Here's what you should do:-1.Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile Network. Now here you need to turn off Mobile Data and Enhanced LTE mode for the SIM you would not use for data services.(If you use data from both SIM, I'm afraid this battery tweak isn't for you)2. Under the Network Settings , uncheck the automatic Network selection for the SIM  you will not use data for ,and manually select the Network to 2G Network of the operator of the SIM. Eg. Manually select Vodafone IN 2G instead of Vodafone IN 4G for Vodafone SIM users3. 3rd Tip is to open Settings > Apps & Notifications > See all apps. Now you will manually have to open each app one by one and open "" Data Used "" and uncheck background data for the apps that you don't use so often or even the online shopping apps that pop up notifications every hour for deals and sale.4. Try using Data Saver and Battery Saver toggle in the notification shade as much as you can.5. Under Mi Services in settings, uncheck ""User Experience Program"" and ""Send diagnostic data automatically""With these tweaks I managed to get 8 hours of Screen On Time and almost 2 day's battery backup.Also the charging time from 1% to 100% is 1 hour 40 minutes with the normal charger supplied.I got this phone for Rs.8100 during the Great Indian Sale after opting to Exchange my Mi A1 and I feel it is a great upgrade over Mi A1. The camera is too good for the price and the UI so far has been really smooth. You can totally feel the difference in camera and performance when compared with Mi A1 and Redmi Note 5 pro.3 Bugs that still exist in this phone which may just not make this phone the perfect budget mid ranger are:-1. Proximity sensor during calls doesn't seem to work properly and the screen remains lit up almost the whole time during the call.2.The adaptive brightness isn't good at all. Even at 50% it becomes too dim in indoors.Though in outdoors at the same 50% level the screen brightens up.3.The sound output via the type c to 3mm jack cable provided with the phone is pathetic. The same earphones that were too loud to bear at 70% on Mi A1 are  low sounding on Mi A2 even at 90 %.Xiaomi needs to fix these issues. Rest apart it's a great phone."	5
4293	Please don't buy this it's have worst senser	1
4294	One of the best camera phones to come in the budget range... but sadly the battery life is shorter than my other Redmi Note 3.  But surely a good buy option for people who love to click.	4

4320	I'm using Huawei P20lite for 4 n half months.Its a good phone for regular works, except sound quality I like this phone using very much.Battery quality can be improved.	5
4321	Redmi 6 pro is a fabulous piece of hardware. It has been bashed mercilessly by tech reviews but as a user with first hand experience of this device. It is incredibly smooth during multitasking and has the best display in the budget segment. The vertical camera placement, fast fingerprint sensor and metal back and finally you get a product which does not disappoint. What else? Although priced at Rs. 10999, I got it for Rs 8899 during Amazon sale.. That's value for money.. You won't find a better device for that price.. An Absolute Beauty 😊	5

4348	I am writing this review after using this phone for 1 week. lets talk about its specification which i like the most and the annoying part about this phone.##First of all its build quality which is satisfying despite its plastic back. it will feel premium in your hand. Samsung is always best when it comes to build quality.##Display is the major portion of a smartphone with which we interact everytime. and believe me guys being a super amoled display you are not going to complain at this pric...READ MORE	5
4349	I am fully satisfied with the phone & posting my review after use of 4 days.it came in good packaging,  courier boy himself offered open box delivery. he made a video while opening the box.  he handed over the phone when I was satisfied with box contents.I had read about sound quality in few reviews earlier but I am satisfied with phone & found much better than my expectations in following manners-1. sound2.  sensors respond very quickly finger/face recognition (response time is hardly half a second)3.  app loads in no time, no matter if  5-6 apps are running at a time.4. The display is very smooth.I am fine with camera quality but it struggles in low light.Will update review in case I feel any issues.Hope, above will help in your decision making if you are planning to buy this phone.	5
4350	Camera is very poor quality.. Who are looking for good camera do not go for it..	3

4352	5Brilliant	5
4353	Awesome phone...Looks killer..Performance is good...Camera is good..Although at night100 apps installed and processor is doing well..Sound quality is nice..Display is good..Premium phone	5
4354	As expected , I reviewed on YouTube dubai version then Indian version , then pro's and cons ..then decided to buy honor play as im.honor huge fan , using honor 6 since 2014, still honor 6 my hero , but honor 9n has battery issue and honor.play has camera issue and honor 8x complete package , so I decided to get that.Believe me its killer perfect in battery , battery saving , camera both front and rear awesome , slow motion is no worlds flawless ,screen vivid brighter , looks so premium and back design lovely.Sound is good both via speaker and earphone rest miui is pretty decent , dual sim volte is cool.Cons :1)  no fast charging ( but seriously I.Don't need bkz , its current charging speed is pretty decent)2) no ir blaster3) face unlock is poor :(So , get it this diwali and feel be honored.	5
4355	I like both phone	5
4356	I bought it 1 month ago from an offline store.The phone is perfect. The charging adapter is perfect.But the charging micro usb cable isn't good enough.It is very short and thin and doesn't charge very fast.I removed it and attached a different micro usb cable to the supplied charging adapter and now,charging is much faster.I am very happy with this phone.	5

4392	Oversaturated colour but the processor is good at this price segment	4
4393	My Lg set is charging time highly hitting,Please resolve it problems.	3
4394	This phone downright sucks!I purchased it from Amazon about 4 months back, the battery doesn't even last a day. You'll have to charge it twice. The camera suddenly started malfunctioning. It takes blurred photos now. Bought LG because of it's brand value but sad to say that I was disappointed.	1
4395	Amazing camera and battery life.Display is also good.	5
4396	First of all it hangs so much... You can see many lags clearly, The miui is not optimised properly particularly in this phone, phone feels weighted, weight distribution not done properly, at higher volume call speaker not working properly, games like pubg play at medium level only with some frame drops and lags.. Background apps quickly shut down and starts from first... Which is annoying all the time... Camera quality is average, snapdragon 625 is the biggest let down...  Only good thing is the battery life..	2
4397	you can surely go for it without thinking twice.....look wise.....10/10battery life...... 10/10performance...... 10/10features.......... 10/10build quality ........ 10/10although there is no type c port and fast charging support.... but i think its hardly matters....	5

4399	There is small heat issue with the phone	5

4426	Feel good factory after having this as it reminds me of iPhone. Thoug its lacking front camera flash. Smooth picture quality is really great.	5
4427	Pros:1. Pure Android Experience: I really like the pure stock android. It is clean, it is fast, it is uncluttered.2. OS and Security Updates: Because of it being released under Android One program it is designated to be one of the first devices outside the pixel universe to receive Android OS (for 2 years) and security updates (for 3 years). It is massive considering the sophisticated attacks that are happening; it is a must to have a device that is always updated to the latest.3. Zippy fast performance: Didn’t experience any lag so far.4. Decent battery life: I use it as my secondary phone and it lasts more than 2 and a half days with approximately 4 hours of screen on time and connected to 4G LTE throughout. Screenshots attached.5. Camera performance (both front and rear) for the price segment6. Vibration motor: The vibration is loud enough that you will not miss it even when you are moving (walking, running, etc).7. Fingerprint sensor performance: It is not the fastest in the ecosystem, but it is fast enough. And really fast for the segment that it is targeting.8. Built Quality: It is a very built phone. I like the weight distribution of it. Very good feel in hand though bit slippery. I have put a case on it.9. Speakers: It is not the best speaker, but it is good enough and gets loud enough; it gets the job done.Cons:1. No Memory card support. I use it as a secondary phone and 64gigs is enough for me and that should be the case for most people.2. No headphone jack. Not an issue for me as I use Bluetooth headsets for the ease of use.3. Doesn’t get bright enough for outdoors sometimes. Though it gets really dim that may help in those low light/night conditions.4. Camera bump: Camera bump is huge. If you type while the phone lies on the table you may be annoyed, it is that big. Workaround: Slap a case on it, which most people do. I’ve done it.Verdict: If the things mentioned in the Cons are not the ones on your priority list for your phone, then GO GET IT. It is the best bang for the buck in this segment or maybe even any segment.	5

4456	Really impressed with the design and displayLooks grand and premium with the displayBetter choose black color for the best looking.Mobile processer speed is good enough for social networking apps and regular usage small apps, but not for serious gaming.	5
4457	I have purchased Q6 plus from chroma. This phone have design flaw. Speaker is not at bottom rather on back side. Very poor quality sound. Stay away from this phone. Not expecting such low quality speaker from LG.	2
4458	Very good budget smartphone under 15k, I got it at 12.5k during Amazon sale. .....Very good picture quality and I just love Android one..... absence of headphone jack is not a big issue but FM radio should have been there...... overall much satisfied	5

4511	All good featureBut camera are not suitable for this phone	5
4512	Excellent handset !!!	5
4513	Well I got it for around 16.5k in a sale. And at that price, it is one of the best android phones you can buy. It has good picture quality, good built quality and a decent long lasting battery. The notch fad (just like absence of headphone jack !) is catching up with almost all phones now but what can you do about it. The collective power of less intelligent people always overpowers the few intelligent and logical ones.	5
4514	Good Budget phone. Disappointed with 3 GB RAM.	5
4515	Was looking for a phone which should be handy, but not bulky. This phone has ticked all my needs and got it for the best price during Oct sale with exchange. May be the best phone  at this price point.	4

Thank you amazon for the discounts on the phone.Anyway the phone does have some heating issues, I will wait to see if that gets resolved in a day or two.Except that everything is good about this phone. 5.5 inch phone looks almost the size of 4.7 inch phone. I am not very heavy user but it runs very very smooth.Will give 5 star once the getting warm thing goes away.	4

4602	First of all, this honor 8X is fresh with new Kirin 710 processor which is fast enough to compete with sd 660.

4662	The worst phone one can get at that price tag. I just bought it by seeing add in Amazon.in after getting the product, I was shocked, the plastic back is the first worst u can see here followed by horrible software installed. The font and the screen alignment is horrible. Coming to camera, the selfie camera is very much comparable with VGA camera which we used to get with Chinees mobiles. The rear camera is taking good photos, there is a tricky, if u see the pic in that mobile it looks Good, but if u zoom it, you cant imagine, its just horrible.Coming to Speakers, if u turn on speaker or off no difference, both will give same sound level. Now talk about call quality, its just horrible, you will felt like, u r listening from old radio.Pros:NothingCons:Everything.Verdict: It is Good phone if it price is 5000. Now u can think of it	1
4663	Mobile ko bahut achha hai front camera portrait mode kaam nahi karta hai 4,5 Rakh De Tu Bina touch kare fingerprint face lock kaam nahi karta hai password lock kholna padta hai but camera quality is very good bad experience my opinion	2

4667	Picture quality is so bad do not buy.	2
4668	Awesome product as expected from Xiaomi.But a bit over priced. Could be below ₹10k	5
4669	All my previous mobiles were flagship phones from Apple or Samsung. In fact i bought this as a backup handset while I am still using Note 8. So got only 3gb one though I use it heavily....here is my review: Excepting few points like poor photos in low light and no fast charge this is otherwise an excellent one. I am so impressed that in future I am considering to buy only from MI. It includes somany features which are useful on day to day usage like IR, call recorder etc. Surprised to see you get all those at this price range unlike samsung whose most features are only available in top end variants while not so useful either. User interface is best and fast as well. Strongly recommend this if looking for a mobile at this price range.	5
4670	just wow wow loved the productREAD MORE	5
4671	Awsome phone	5

4673	14 months into useing this mobile real value for money...the durability is too good the military grade finish sustained 4 times fall from 6 feet hight without a single crack/ scratch....	5

4678	Well all thing is good but it screen is not much big in breadth	5
4679	It is so inconvenient to use this phone if you prefer low brightness indoor, because as soon as you get under the sun you cannot see anything on the screen. You cannot even see the brightness bar to up the brightness.	1

4691	Moblie is perfect but i am facing a problem . I am not able to plug in my ear phones properly. . earphones are so loose that the get detached from phone automatically . kindly see to it asap	1
4692	Good phone, but not worth 15k.  Screen size, I feel smaller than normal 5.5 inch.  Costing, on competitive point of view, 9+1 k is ideal.  (1 k for LG).Many people given negative rating due to the absence of fnger print sensor, to me it is not a major concern, because, I am seeing,  people around me don't use it.	4
4693	Camera is too good. Overall features are nice. Good phone in budget.	5

4701	VERY GOOD MOBILE	5
4702	Nothing like it	5
4703	I am also the first reviewer. If you are confused with mid range phone, I can blindly say go with Nokia. You will never be disappointed.Better than honor,redmi.same was expecting from Nokia and got the same thing. Looks awesome. I purchased honor 9 lite 1 month back and exchanged with Nokia 6.1 fully satisfied with this deal. Nokia is Nokia.	5

4714	Name a feature and it’s there. Looks like iX at a budget price	4
4715	The font size for the App icons and the graphic icon letters everywhere are small and there is no ability to change that. We can change the font size for the menu items in settings display but that doesnt apply for the graphic icons and icon letters. Difficult for elderly people with eye sight issue.	4
4716	This mobile not worth to Rs. 13000	3
4717	Don't buy this phone. Draining battery and heating problem on using normal applications.	1

4753	Not happy with the camera picture quality.....	4
4754	I had some problems migrating files from motog2 to the motog6; problem may be due to the old mail-id on the G2. The sound quality on the g6 is bad, both volume and clarity less than that on the G2 and G4.	3
4755	Not for Camera centric people.Overall good package.Deserve the price bracket of 12k.	4
4756	Don't buy this handset...it takes more than 3hr to full battery charge..	1
4757	Quality	5
4758	Very good phone in that basket, would have been better if at least 636 processed was provided	4
4759	So its been 15 days I have been using this phone.And here is a detailed review about that-  *Build quality*(+1Star)+The phone is completely made of metal and has a glass finish at the back which attracts fingerprint smudges but looks very premium.+The phone feels very sturdy when you hold it in your hand.+It feels a bit hefty due to that 4000MaH massive battery but isn't such heavy that your hands would start paining when holding it for long.+Due to that metal,somewhat hefty weight and glass finish when holding, it perfectly seems like a expensive phone(Tho it isn't).+It has rugged kinda finish on the sides which gives a little bit grip if you aren't going to use a back cover.+The phones isn't super thin but justifies the thinness due to that battery.+The build quality at this price could be the best depending on user, for me it was above par.===========================================================================================  *Display*(+1Star)+The display is vibrant but sharp.+It has good viewing angles not the best.+Brightness level is as required,even at its highest the rays doesn't irritate your eyes.+It has the feature to disable the notch.===========================================================================================  *Camera*(+1Star)+Not the best one but good considering the 15K price point.+Rear cameras are good but the front cameras can be better.+The AI camera isn't a marketing trick.It really works,There would be a huge difference in the photos taken in the initial days vs photos taken after 15 Days(AI does it work)===========================================================================================  *Performance*(1.5 Star)+Now this what I would expect from a Kirin 710 + GPU turbo combined phone, Amazing performance considering the price point.+No lags,No Frame drops (PUBG HD at High)+Complete performance no issues in that, there won't be any phone in the market right who could beat this phone at its performance at this price.===========================================================================================  *UI*(-0.5 Star)+This is something which dissapointed me.+ The EMUI is not that great but not the worst as well.It lies between bad and good.+If the Phone had Stock android then it just would have mindblown everyone.+The 10% lags that the phone would suffer would be just because of that UI.+Considering the price point it's still bearable.===========================================================================================  *Misc*+Fingerprint sensor is pretty accurate(4.5/5.0)+Face unlock is good.  (4.0/5.0)+Speakers are very loud,less bassy.  (4.0/5.0)===========================================================================================^^^Final Vedict^^^ -In my opinion at this price point you wont find any phone in the market with such Build quality and performance.If camera isnt your prime need then you can blindly buy this phone.You wont regret thats my assurance.Note-This a totally unbiased review composed on my own experience If you have any doubts about this phone You can reach me anytime at siyonmaster008@gmail.com.Have attached some images.Siyon RoyFollow on IG for Gadget reviews @ardent_geek_7***********************************************************HAVE A GOOD DAY******************************************************	4

4787	I was using MI A1 , So i found its camera week than MI A1	4
4788	This will be to the point. All the selling features of this phone turn out to be disadvantages in the longer run.-> Durable - Phone starts feeling really heavy really soon-> Carl Zeiss lens - But software that processes images is crap-> Android One - Just a blunder. Provides you with unlimited storage on cloud. Sounds awesome, doesn't it. It will take a day or two for you to realize that the phone does not have a local gallery at all. All the images reside in the cloud so you cannot (I am shaking my head in disbelief) You cannot see your pics when there is no internet.	1
4789	Everything is OK. Nice phone	5

4812	"Let's divide this into two sectionsPROS1. Love the display honor provides you with.Punchier colours and the blacks are more deeper.2. The smallest chin 4.6mm3. Hisilicon kirin 710 for this price. As parent company Huawei provides this chip at 23k.4. Sony sensor 20MP camera with AI.5. All glass and metal body.6. Beautiful glass back.7. EMUI 8.2 is loaded with features.8. 3750mAh battery lasts longer.9. Super large 6.5"" IPS FHD+ display10. Full juice in 2hrs (same as Poco F1)11. Awesome night mode and 480fps slow mo.12. Still having 3.5mm Jack. ;)13. Output from Audio Jack is also dope.14. Has option to switch between hight to low resolution.15. OTA updates from honor is constant.CONS1. Lacks type-C port.2. Lacks front sensors for better face unlocking, but it still works well with display brightness.3. No OIS and EIS in Camera app, though Honor says it will added in updates.4. Too large for one handed usage.5. Dual camera setup but with only 2MP Depth sensor.6. Speaker sound could have been better.All in all,I think it take 9 out of 10 points from me as most of the phones in this price bracket doesn't provide such options and features.Compared it with MiA2 where the device is powered by slower SD636 which is no where to Hisilicon Kirin 710. Also many people disguise it as OnePlus 6."	5

4826	Best mobile in the present marked for this price range.	5
4827	Yes. It's not an extraordinary smartphone. Overall a good performance phone where you have a good battery life, good camera, good sound quality and obviously better screen resolution. Almost similar to a bezel less smartphone. Like always the phone is of tough quality. Finally I'd say, smartphone worth buying as you have the trust of one of the top smartphone manufacturing company LG.😃	4
4828	I bought it in last September. While charging it became an iron box	1

4875	I have been using Huawei P20 Lite phone since 2 weeks and its worth the money. Find below some detailed review -Pros -1. One of the best selfie camera (24 Mega Pixel) in this price range2. Awesome Rear camera (Dual Camera) with so many options to play with, even we dont need snapchat for face creation. Its in built.3. No lags in face unlock4. Beautiful build quality, premium look when you hold the phone.5. Notch style display which is again a plus for the phone6. No heating issues at allCons -Really I did not find any till date as its running perfectly and I am loving it.Thanks	5

4881	Awesome phone!!Optimized software with good hardware makes a difference,far better than RN5 pro in terms of design and fluid software.Killer camera.Purchased at 15K red colour and thin design looks stunning.Some heating issues while charging and medium to high intense gaming. Surely, not for gamers.But, it flies in day to day usage.If you can live without headphone jack and 4-5 hrs. of screen on time,this is the phone for you.Software because of Android One is near stock and flawless.Recently got Android Pie update,very happy with my phone❤️	5

4891	Quality is Good. Battery life is good.	4
4892	1.8 Ghz octacore with snapdragon 450 coupled with 4 GB RAM doesnt make us think that phone will hang or stop functioning.....but contrary to expectations, one of the worst phones as in initial days only the performance is sub standard. Not at all recommended.	1

4895	Picture quality is good, sound is good. And battery life is as usual	5
4896	Battery life is so good	5
4897	Writing review after 10days using the phone.1. Look wise good.2. Camera performance is stunning (Rear) but front camera is not that much good. I've MotoG4plus and Mi4i for comparison. LGQ6 front cam pics are not up to the mark with this price segment of 15k.3. Face detection lock is very prompt and responsive.4.full vision view is amazing.5. Good battery back up. No heating issue at all. No hanging issue. Dedicated 2 sim n 1 card slot. Very slim phone, a resemblance of iPhone from front.6. Earphone is ok type.Conclusion:-  Overall this is a good phone, very smart look and also feel smart while holding it. Easy to use with single palm. It's price should not be more than 12.5k or we can say additional 2.5k is for the LG branding..	4
4898	Solid item. Perhaps the best product developed by Mind. Solid build, excellent camera ( both front & back, blazing speed, loosing lasting battery life( 2 days ), good ram management. Mindblowing sound, crystal clear FHD display, and all at a pocket friendly price.	5

4925	This phone will surely handle day to day tasks and even some low end games that you throw at it (eg. pubg in minimal settings.) just don't expect it to outperform other rivals from different brands within this price range (on some aspects it does. read further.) surely it can take on any smartphone within this price bracket when it comes to battery life.I am using the 4gb ram/ 64 gb version and it met my need. this phone is surely a bank for the buck and high end gaming and camera should not be your priority when you are investing so little money.On the other hand as I mentioned earlier, battery life is excellent. the phone looks good and feels good in the hand. it's sturdy and suitable for someone with small fist.to sum up this phone is alright for regular use like launching basic apps, taking basic pictures and every thing basic. you can't go wrong with this phone if you are a regular user.  I am happy with my purchase. Kudos Xiaomi.	2
4926	Picture and sound quality is best in this range.battery is little low but for normal user it give battery backup of 24 hrs. I have used it by playing games, youtube,and talking but instead give 24 hrs backup	5

4932	Camera and display very very bad...	1
4933	Nice phone but front camera is not good	5
4934	I have been using this phone for a month now and I'm not one bit disappointed. It is everything that has been featured.The Camera seems to be the best part of Huawei.Personal experience, this phone isn't very good at multitasking and if high performance mode is on, it doesn't give a day's battery. It also has a feature of uninterrupted gaming mode which was quite appealing.Overall, its a wonderful build. Gestures, notch, design, all of it.	5
4935	cool phone great display nice color	5

4965	Awesome phone, but still they can improve camera a lot	5
4966	The design is very nice and worth for the money	5
4967	Totally Surprised by this Beast ! Was little apprehensive initially due to the reviews on YouTube but they were minor glitches regarding 4k video and sound  etc but they have been taken care off, since it was launched in September end, there were issues but not anymore.First things first: It has an amazing battery life, precisely 2 days with heavy Netflix and gaming.It's a no nonsense phone with no ADs whatsoever like Xiaomi phones.Oppo and Vivo are no match to honor 8x, I just bought vivo v 9 in October and it is utter crap by wasting 18 k on vivo v 9.The kirin chipset is way beyond SG 632 and is the best so far in the segment.There are many reviews about it's camera problem, they either don't know yet how to manage settings for a camera or they have copied fake reviews, it has little over saturated settings and the pictures sometime look overdone but still at this price point, camera turns out to be the best.This is the only phone that has been compared with iPhone 10 on youtube by Techspurt.The only con I would say is it's sound quality when paired with an earphone other wise sound quality is great , like said initially it had sound as well as camera issues but now it has been take care off well.  Also Honor 8 x shall be getting EMUI 9.0 and android PIE update latest by Jan  as its still being rolled out in China under beta testing.This by far is the best and way beyond oppos Vivo and Xiaomi, it also has some very cute feature for call handling.	5
4968	Very fragile body and replacement is very costly	1
4969	Heating problem & performance not good.Waste of money.	1
4970	Everything is fine but mobile seems to lag when multiple applications are open	3
4971	Awesome rate no one can beat..	5
4972	Camera not up to the mark	1
4973	Nice LCD display. Has decent sound. But battery don't not last even a single day. If u sort of heavy user u can only use device for upto 4 hours	4
4974	Vijay PatelLG Q6 - The phone looks good and fits comfortably in the hand, Beautiful display, like premium Mobile, good camera, Very light weight, Premium look, Sleek & small phone still having the 5.5 inches display, I missed fingerprint sensor but face unlock is way better and stylish feature, but It feel awesome to Unlock phone with your Face, Phone Heating after extensive usage, Biggest reason for buying this phone is its not Chinese product,though lack of some features. But when you hold cell in hand the feeling was awesome like premium, and this is Made in India, phones Overall LG Q6 best phone in this price range.	4
4975	but phone was good.. only problem is little heating still there and radiation compared with same generation phones from other manufacturers..otherwise rest are ok..	4
4976	Good quality.But compared to cost is high.	4

4978	All over honor 8x is a best smartphone in 15 k price segment. beautiful design, Notch display,back glass...awesome mobile...but packaging is not well..Amazon provide very bad packaging..am received smartphone in wrapped in plastic and under honor smartphone box...not.big box....	5

4982	Band is not connected	1
4983	value for money as always from redmi	3
4984	Over all phone is good but some changes are very bad. Screen length is good but width too short. Front camera quality is not upto standard. Rear camera also not a very high quality but it's ok. Battery duration ok. Sound quality is very good.	4
4985	I like the quality of the picture so much ,really mi has done the splendid job....	5
4986	The only thing bad about this phone is it's front camera. A 5mp camera with no flash is just unusable. Rear camera is is good (but not very good) but depth sensing is not accurate. Otherwise compact design, and nice look. Features like ir blaster, fm radio, 3.5 mm jack are present and that is a plus point.	4
4987	Very beautiful	4
4988	excellent phone	5

4992	Finally I'm out. Not a good model from MI. Battery life is too bad and earphone option is another disadvantage. Earphone left side not working.....	1

4996	1. Android One2. Great Camera3. Great build quality4. Decent battery5. Smooth touch interface6. Decent sound output7. No bloatwareIf you don’t like wasting money, buy this device. It would meet most of the functions expected from a smartphone.	5
4997	Save the front camera, everything else on the phone is worth the money. Battery life is off the hook. You charge it once and then with medium usage, it'll last two full days. No problem of Hybrid slot in this one, so you could attach a SD card as well. If you could spend a few more bucks, go for Note5 Pro. The 6 GB RAM variant.	5
4998	A very good mobile, it has good packaging, picture quality is dope, sound quality is good, battery life is very good	5
4999	Very good experience than expected	5

5036	Good phone for day by day usage...as per price segment really satisfied.	5
5037	Picture quality best	5
5038	Very good product. Mom is really happy with camera quality and design	5
5039	Screen display clarity is excellent. Handy and can operate with one hand. Battery back up is good if not using high number of applications and the OS prompts for the application consuming high battery. overall the phone is good but the audio sound is low while watching any videos.	4
5040	Battery life is so poor	4
5041	If you are a person who expect a phone to have longer battery life and pure performance then go for it. There were few reviews about camera, but seems no difference from my earlier phones. You should be a pro to identify the camera picture quality. Worth buying and will never regret your decision on you take hold of this device.	5
5042	Problem is now solved..got cash back..thanks amazonI am deeply regreting to buy from amazon this time.. As committed on 11 oct 2018 offer, iBuyer will get amazon rs 1000 cashback as well as free screen replacement warranty for 1 year via third party agency tie up. However,  almost 20 days now nothing has come back. Intially few customer care executive were either denying if i am eligible or some executive also told I am unaware of any such offers. However 3rd executive interaction i was confirmed for eligibility but no results till date.  It means once u buy the product you are least useful to amazon. My past experience of buying from amazon was just wonderful and beyond the words. Have bought sony tv, mobiles through, curtains etc... Never faced so..	3
5043	not a snapdragon 435 processor but snapdragon 430 ad back side is full of palstic	2
5044	Mi A2 is the best budget android one phone you can get in the market. Power packed features and great camera in this segment. If u want to have a pure android phone like Pixel, then you can go for this one without any second thought.	5
5045	I was expected triple hybrid slot.2 for sim and 1for card.otherwise product is good.	4
5046	NICE MOBILEREAD MORE	5
5047	It's a money skimming strategy because of notch display. The phone has nothing in terms of extraordinary.Unfortunately, I got it with a scratch on screen about half centimetre.Performance is okay. Face recognition is very slow.Display is crisp though.Camera again not promising enough.Earphones and charger provided are sub standard.It has No fast charging (refer attached pic)Lot of bloatware- uninstalling pre installed apps is also a task.Shouldn't be more than INR 12k.I don't suggest buying it.	1
5048	Best ph	5
5049	This model will be the first in entire Redmi Series, to blemish and destroy the Brand Name. Xiaomi will be left with no option but to hide face by stopping their Redmi category. It has severe network issues, and has almost no sound, when put on loudspeaker.	2
5050	I have been using it for 4-5 months now and it's a great smartphone for the price. I have no issues with it whatsoever.	4
5051	It received as expected in time and in sound condition.  Prior to purchase I have studied the features of the phone and now it performs as stated.  I give 5 star to this phone.	5

5059	After receiving Honor 8X mobile it's looks like awesome, Sound is average, Bettery life is good and value for money is positive. But using after 30 mins there is a vertical line automatically appeared on the screen which makes me disappointed. So I returned this product and hope amazon will give the better quality replacement of Honor 8X in the next delivery.	1

5065	No doubt , phone is damn good in looks and also in ram rom, but disappointing part its battery. Hardly on 12hrs of backup on whole day net on. In short you need to charge battery twice a day.	3

5068	Display Quality and battery backup is good	5
5069	Very nice .	5

5071	Screen quality is excellent and looks stunning with the notch. Sound quality is very nice. Camera quality is good and is includes automatically some filters to the picture.night mode is very good.battery is good.Is lasts almost one day for heavy users and for moderate users it lasts 1.5 days.	5
5072	I am moving back to Android after a long time and for a trial I chose Mi A2 after reading too many positive reviews about its camera. I like photography too much and camera is something which always matters to me.But since last 3-4 days I couldn't figure out what's great about it's camera despite having dual cameras.Even its bokeh effect it cannot beat Realme 1. Focusing on subject is a headache itself. Even after locking the Focus & Exposure, picture gets blurry most of the times. I cannot compare it with iPhone but at least it should be better than Realme 1 which has just one camera. It claims to have good image quality in low light, but my last Friday night's photography experience says otherwise .Battery can't even last for 10-11 hours with minimal usage. My 3.5 years old Lenovo P1m gives close to 30 hours of backup with 10-12 hours of online video streaming. Even my father's Realme 1 lasts way longer than this 17k brick.Now talk about processor & GPU... I used to play Sniper Fury in Realme 1 without any lag or delay and same on my iPhone 7. But Mi A2 can't handle that too. Graphics are so pathetic that I stopped playing on this mobile. Let me remind you that Realme1 & Mi A2 have same RAM & memory. But in gaming experience, Realme1 outranks MiA2 by miles.It has been only 5 days since I purchased this phone and I already have started looking for another one. I am feeling that I've just wasted my money on this product.	2
5073	Picture and sound quality good and battery life is also good. But Call not disconnected most of the time by touch button.	3
5074	Good battery backup and clear picture quality.	5
5075	Overall the phone is good but I got the damage piece	5
5076	I bought this phone and my point of view that...side crome and folder of this phone is flop..0 star	1
5077	Good as required. All over product is fulfill my requirements. Better sound quality battery life and screen guality as aspects.	5
5078	bestOverall great lookGreat design and comfortable	5
5079	I love this mobile, camera is good , battery is good, screen is awesome	4
5080	The best in all departments. It's a phone worth your money. I'm just loving it.	5
5081	Works smooth in maximum condition..	4
5082	Look, Feel, Display, Performance is awesome. I still have my old moto G as shown in in perfect condition as shown in pic which is a proof that Moto is trusted brand. I bought Moto g6 so that I can use VoLTE Reliance Jio SIM. When it comes to redmi  note brand, initially pics would be great but slowly after couple of years Pics would be blurry. But Moto pics would always be awesomeSome people are commenting that Camera is slow but the fact is they are not smart as they are not selecting the Manual option in camera settings after which the camera shutter would be super fast.Suggestion: Better buy back cover for better protectionI bought Annure cover which fits well and looks great	5

5089	My phone fingerprint is not showing in the settings how can i enable this?	1
5090	Basically, what I came to know that, don't buy a cheap phone, save your money and go for the better quality phone.  These cheap brands like MI, they will provide you with good specification at a cheaper rate, but at the end of the day, you can't trust them.  I bought this phone almost three weeks before writing this review. Everything was going good and suddenly one day without any reason the display alongside the notch is gone. I called Mi customer care and informed them about the situation and they are like less bother about it. But finally, they showed some responsibility and I submitted my phone to Mi customer care. Now I don't know how long it will take to repair or replace my phone.  So my humble request to all if you think twice before buying a low budget phone.	1
5091	IT'S AWESOM	5
5092	good quality, smooth working, easy handling, good looks, nice features, would inform you to buy this fone for finest quality with highest RAM then any other branded fone..would recommend to buy this one	5

5114	***Those who are complaining about battery and heating problems please update to the latest software updates and see results***Secondly disable MLT/LDB (an LG background app) to save RAM and battery by dialing *#546368#*700# (700 is code of Q6) then SVC menu-LDB-uncheck 'Enable'- Restart phone.Now coming to the review, I have bought this phone with exchange offer with my not so working fine iphone 5s in just 5890 (13000 on diwali offer less 3000 discount on exchange less 4100 for my little problematic 5s)The first two things I did after turning on the device are already mentioned above. Then no heating issue at all which I slightly noticed before getting those updates.Battery is far better than iphone 5s (1530 mah on that). Please don't expect 3-4 days battery on just every phone unless you are going to lost yourself somewhere without any electricity. You will easily get 24 hours of backup on moderate usage. Turn on batter saver mode and turn off auto brightness to save more just in case.Those complaining about fingerprint scanner should have read specs before purchasing. You have face recognition, pin lock, pattern lock for safety. . For me double tap to wake and sleep does great job.I'm a moderate user so I'm not disappointed with performance. While using social networking sites, youtube, music, videos and more, no lags found.Rear camera does a good job if not the best in this price with it's great dynamic range with great shots with its HDR mode on. Though less control due to no manual adjustments in camera. Low light performance gets a hit due to f/2.2 aperture. Video stability is amazing.Front camera could be better but its not the worst. Does job really fine in daylight and with 100 degree wide lens camera.Speaker should have been put below the phone but the sound doesn't disappoints. Earphones provided with device are not having great bass as the earphones are of ordinary style not in-ear, but the sound quality is impressive.Now come to the most beautiful thing, THAT DISPLAY. You got a 5.5 inch display in a body of 5 inch phone. Touch is smooth, LG UI is good, helping tips for hidden features are provided, bloatfree, handy or compact. You can easily type with one hand on that massive taller display. Overall I got the best device in below 15k price though I paid below 6k only.OverallDisplay 4.5/5 (perfection lies nowhere)Design 4/5 (back is scratch prone, scratchless lamination or case will do the job, fingerprint scanner absent and wrong place for speakers)Camera 3.5/5 (low light performance should have been better, front camera could be better, though I'm not a selfie lover)Battery 4/5 (should have provided 3500 for slight improvement)Performance 3.5/5 (not made for heavy gamers, should have put 600 series of snapdragon at this price)Those who want a phone for long run, gaming and good camera can choose Redmi A1 powered by Google. For me that mesmerizing display is more than enough as per my need and preferences at the price I paid. But I feel the price should have been 12k or less to compete in Indian (Chinese inside) market.	5

5125	Battery draining issue, it drains very fast, othereise phone is an ultimate mobile in this range	2
5126	Good product nice looking  value for m9ney	5
5127	Gifted to mum. Works fine. Not too expensive. Nothing too fancy. Decent android ka item. Mum appreciates it.	5
5128	Picture quality, sound quality and battery problems to week	2
5129	Worst mobile..always heating only display good others very worst.. mobile performance slow after installing some aplications. Mobile got hot for normal usage fb,whatsapp i have returned.	1
5130	Awesome Mobile !!! Yet to receive Android update and no head set port and not even usb connection port or even adapter	5
5131	Camra is quit better	2
5132	Even 1 star is waste for this phone. Device gets hot within 15 min of use. I can't touch the hard keys also. As it is waste phone, amazon is giving more exchange offer price for this phone.	1
5133	Bad experience, defective product delivered	1
5134	LG Q6 has simple interface  easy to operate .. .. I like it ...	4
5135	VERY GOOD	5
5136	I had bought this product on the first day of release, after a week's use i found suddenly the media volume going very low in spite of the volume controls being at maximum and  then gets restored the next day. I have called for an replacement.	2
5137	Good phone loving it	5
5138	The FHD display is amazing, sound quality is quite appreciable. Regarding the battery life, as it's been only a few days to purchase the phone so, I cannot say much but till date it's going good.	4
5139	All good. Battery life good. Camera fine. Speed is good.	5
5140	Mobile is average came is worst	3
5141	Build Quality and Display is TOO good. But Camera(both front and back) is not up to the mark when compared to others. Looks vise premium and works like OK. No screen cast, finger print etc which are commonly provided in basic range phones also.	3
5142	If you want to buy premium looking phone with good specifications then Honor 8X is match made in heaven for you. Here I want to share some pros and consPROS :1. Build quality is solid and looks really premium2. It comes with Hisilicon Kirin 710 with Octa Core 2.2 GHz Processor which comes with Mali G51 GPU which can perform your everyday task quite easily and smoothly.3. 3750 mah battery can easily last 1 and Half day if you are casual user.4. Comes with AI camera and special night mode feature and Camera quality is quite good for day photos.5. 6.5 inch huge vivid screen and body to screen ratio is 91% which is great considering its price6.Eye Comfort modeCONS :1. Old USB instead of USB TYPE C2.Speaker isn't that loud comparing to other devices at this price Point3.No Fast Charging is disappointment4. Camera struggles in low light conditions but thank God there's night mode which is quite good.VERDICT : Honor 8X is great mid range smartphone with its eye catching design and great camera.The ample of space and notch display are the highlight features of the phone.	5
5143	Fantastic phone, meets all my requirement. Battery life is too good. Lasts for 2 days	5
5144	It has very good battery life and photo quality is good. Phone color is also good and has the trust of MI	4

5181	It's good product low weight	5
5182	Superb phone in a premiam look.... Amazing product from huawei	5
5183	The product was completely blundered as per the specs ... the phone keeps on heating like a heater and needs to be switched off time and again to cool it down . if not then the phone might blast. About the battery life its like 2000 mah battery which drains in some hours. Worst battery life.  Touch screen doesn't respond somwtimes its like the new launch of an touch screen era. MI not at all expected such services iwas expecting some basic specs to atleast work well ...but completely waste of money at this time when the phone plays such important role in today's life.  Cant suggest anyone MI to anyone for sure.	1
5184	Good budget phone and good exchange value	5
5185	Phone is best except its length breath ration is not too good.and camera quality is not too good.	5
5186	Camera is tooo good but battery life is very poor and the performance is also not good as it have Sd660 ,it's slow..	3
5187	Phone performance is bad, camera is bad may be because of android-one but still issues are more.	1

Couple of Camera stills are attached (one in artificial day light condition and other at night in low light using flash)First of all I am a big Apple iPhone fan, i appreciate their work a lot and found iOS more easy and familiar or say reliable than the android platform, and i am currently using 2 iphones along with Nokia 6.1 Plus and have previously used android's Moto G5 Plus and X...READ MORE	5
5194	very very very nice product	5
5195	Very nice phone thanks amazon 😊	5
5196	Good but getting over heated on net.	5
5197	GOOD LUCK	5
5198	Amazing mobile but no native video calling that saddens	1
5199	i have received defective product and there is no option to return as well. they are sending defective products so don't choose Samsung product guys	1
5200	Poor camera quality in all terms. It's portrait mode is bad because it doesn't cover blur area outside your face. Sound quality is also bad with headphones or without headphones. But the battery is good.	3
5201	i got this mibile at 13.500/ super deal quality is good	4
5202	Sound qulity not dolby and processor performance not ok.	3

5204	I Bought with maximum discount. Very very nice mobile.	5
5205	Nice phone. Good cam. Battery little bit bad. But not very bad 6 to 7 hrs screen on time while using 3g	5
5206	It's a great phone in this budget and you will get nice specifications	4
5207	I like the camera of this mobile but battery backup is very useless..	5
5208	Nice product and it has been fast delivered. Thankyou teamREAD MORE	5
5209	Screen is excellent. Camera could have been better specially front one. Battery life is good it lasts for around w days. No dual 4G or VOLTE on standby.	4
5210	Camera is my first priority,,and I love stock android,,so bought mi A2 after using vivo v3 for long....A2 is superb,,camera awesome,,i guess best in this range..Got this phone at 12500(10% discount+1000amazon cash back)...I am super happy,,phone looks so stylish too...Battery could be better	5
5211	Best mobile phone....Battery backup is good better than Nokia... Camera is too good	5
5212	Battery Performance is very poor.Camera is below average	2
5213	Hanging problem, sound quality is not good, battery life is good.	3
5214	First of all, battery is not an issue. It easily pulls through a full day on regular usage of ½ hour calling, 2 hours of YouTube, 1 hour of WhatsApp & Facebook. I used only WiFi, so I don't know if 4G drains the battery. I got this for my Dad who doesn't play games at all & has WiFi both at home n office. His main requirement was long lasting as he was using HTC since past 3 yrs. So I suggested him a Snapdragon 660 mobile phone as it wouldn't slow down at least for 2-3 yrs on regular usage.Now some Pros:1. Good screen indoors. All Redmi phones are poor in sunlight legibility (incl. my Note 5 Pro).2. Full metal design (though reduces signal reception) & light weight.3. Superior camera compared to my Note 5 Pro.4. Great processor & good Ram management.5. Low charging time (even on regular charger).6. Loud ringtone.7. Cover is nice.Now some Cons:1. Sound from speaker for media is pathetic.2. Instead of a USB to 3.5mm dongle, proper USB headphones should have been provided.3. Red colour is lighter & looks pinkish (feminine).4. Signal reception is mediocre maybe due to all metal body.5. No face unlock.Android One is good for no bloatware but poor in functionality. Very basic - not a feature rich OS unlike Note 5 Pro.	4
5215	good phone overall but not value for money	5
5216	Welcome	5
5217	Nice prodect	4
5218	,I had Moto,Sony ,Nokia before purchasing LG q6,really stunning look .LG IU awesome,but the camara of both front n back not good.front camara is too cheaper than china phone.battery is worst fully charged phone lost only 4 hour for moderate usage.i am daily charging 3to 4 time .	2

5232	Buttery smooth ..This phone will give u a ultimate smooth experience with Android pie update ..when I 1st use the phone it sort of lag and battery is about 6 hrs screen on time .Then I update it to pie then it become perfect ..No issue with headphone jack or sound quality of the speaker for me .Screen looks very good. and now battery backup is increasing to 8-9 hours screen on time with normal usages. ..Camera is excellent. Screen is nice .slim ,good to hold. Screen look a bit old but overall desing is Ok ..but performance is high really really high ..I am satisfied with the device till now .	5

5270	Not sooo good. Ok product. Still lagging issues are there and speaker is not good. Some noisy and echo coming from speaker and only one speaker. And android trapping the cookies and sending so many ads . even not able to see videos also. And sms too.worst mobile. Even amazon calling also not exchanging and not replacing. They are argueing with the customers. Stupid service from amazon and mi both of them for this mobile category. Wrongly brought it and no way to replace. Just cheating with the fake and low rated smartchk app for the device and this one will fake results. Even i have run the app in other devices which is not good. But this app says everything fine then amazon don't replace. Everyone finding their own ways to grab the money from the public.	1
5271	The product is really good and is worth buying.	5
5272	Build quality is awesome..Pictures quality is not up to the mark... Selfie is good... High colour saturation in rear Camera pics.. Battery life good...Performance is awesome... Worth of money... Go for it #thanx honor #thanx amazon	4
5273	Good condition of the mobile phone and picture-sound quality best	5
5274	I am very much impressed with the Redmi 6 Pro phone fulfilled by Amazon. The features which I wished in my future phone are available in this phone at a budget range. Redmi is a true leader of Smart Phone in the Indian market.	5
5275	Not really a great phone. I have been using G3 for three years, compared to that G6 doesn't give a great experience. Most disappointing part is battery life, which hardly lasts for 24 hrs.	3

5289	I received the product without Sim tray when ordered initially. Had to contact their customer support multiple times to get it replaced.It is one of the best phones in its category.	5
5290	Trust me this phone is well ahead of its time, in 15k you won't find 6.5 inch display with such clarity and screen to body ratio and beezels are next to non exsisting. Now its sound quality which is really good, i mean via headphone it lack amplification but don't get me wrong, at full volume it's loud enough with great bass and clarity, very much recommended for those who stays on headphone for long period. The best part is its call quality and signal reception , its simply outstanding. Battery is good enough but not for power users. Overall if you buy this product, it will not go out of style for atleast 3 years mainly considering its price.	5
5291	Good product in 11k rangeFall in love in first seenEvery thing is awesome performance is better 625snapdragon processor gives it more powerfulRear camera is very good but i am disappointed about front camera but in perfect light front camera also give it work perfectly but in low light condition it faces some noise on photosBattery backup is awesome in normal use one day battery backup is always occurring.so i gives it ****(4star) picture quality is too good it feels like 4k resolution also sound quality is very good	4

The screen is the main usp of the phone I’ll be surprised pleasantly by the screen it’s damn good. I got it for a very good deal and I am more than satisfied. Overall it is Awesome phone and it is even worth more than 10k easily...	5

5307	Overall performance is excellent	5
5308	Bought this product on 25th Sept 17 and received on 26th sept 17. THIS PHONE IS NOT AS PER SPECIFICATIONS MENTIONED ON AMAZON. PROCESSOR IS SNAPDRAGON 435 MENTIONED ON AMAZON AND OTHER SITES AS WELL. BUT LG HAS GIVEN SNAPDRAGON 430 WHICH HAS TOO MUCH HEATING ISSUE. 435 IS WAY BETTER THAN 430. ALSO I RECEIVED THE PHONE HAVING SOME LIGHT SCREEN BLACK SHADES WHICH ARE CLEARELY VISIBLE WITH BARE EYES. I HAVE POSTED HERE PHOTO CLICKED BY MY NEW SAMSUNG ON MAX PURCHASED ON SAME DATE. ALSO UPLOADED PROCESSOR DETAILS.If product is not as per specifications mentioned on site then refund should be given.	1

5311	Volume up and down key not working. Already initiated the replacement request	3
5312	Product was very good	4
5313	Yes... undoubtedly phone is superb because of  it's camaras, processor and Android one.But at the same time few shortfalls are audio pin, no memory card facility and SMALL capacity battery.If you are comfortable with it's shortfalls. Then this mobile will be a good choice for you otherwise simply ingnore move to other  phone.	4
5314	Superb mobile.Gift for me.Get this mobile without doubt	5
5315	I did not want to go for others brands and also wanted something which is trendy and has quality. Prefect One	5
5316	Good budget phone.. The only thing i dislike is the size of the phone it is big..cant use the phn with one hand..so far so good...	4
5317	I'm fan MI but No dual volte.. waste of money..	1
5318	All over exilent product	5
5319	One of the best mobiles I have ever bought. Excellent look, very light, user friendly software.	5
5320	"As it's Name says 'Xtraordinary'. It is built to be the best in it's price range. Camera issues can be fixed but everything else is designed to last long. The EMUI is wonderful with so many customizations options. No lags. Honor has done a very good job in making the design of phone look premium and with its 6.5"" screen size giving way to 91% screen to body ratio.The processor Kirin 710 is a very powerful in its price segment. No heating issues. Battery is powerful enough to use. Honor hasn't compromised upon any thing. They have given the best possible phone in this price range.A must purchase phone!! Hat's off to Honor!!!!!"	5
5321	first of all this is the worst phone you can buy for 20,000 rs. now i am going to point out the problems i am facing.1- Camera is very very bad. they claim 24 megapixel but it's not even 12 megapixel.2- phone hangs often from the first day.3- it also has no flash light on front camera.4- battery life is not good. i need to recharge this phone 3 times a day. i am not even a heavy user.5- it's screen is weird and small that you can not see the full content of any app or website, you have to scroll left and right to see the whole page.	1

5373	not upto the marks,, dont go for it seriusly	2
5374	I Bought this device on the Launch date itself. After using this phone for about 1 month, the experience is amazing. As this being my 1st Samsung phone with S.O.C processor. Processor manages app and device calibration very well. Camera is above avg, sply Live focus and Depth modes are main features. Video stabilization is auto active & very impressive, even in low light. Night mode's still and video both results are good, should recommend tripod. Front camera is also very good, gives good images with LED as well as screen flash, both gets activated when clicking image. Battery management is very impressive, it easily last upto 1.5 to 2 days. I am not a heavy gamer, all standard apps, 3 to 4 hours of music, whatsapp, Crome and few games like Subway surfer etc, few shopping app and 5 to 6 of bank apps. All runs smoothly. M Not using face id., Finger print scnner is small but very ppwerful & fast, can also use for drop down of notifications pane. Body is bit slippery-good cover is required. Viewing 720-60 video experience is something above avg. Only issue is LED notification is missing.Got 2 OTA update so far - 1 for main O/S and Custom U.I. software and 2 for Jul'18 Security Patch.Overall, I really like this phone. Thumps up..	5
5375	Picture quality is best even no fon under 30000 has such an excellent camera,,sound good ,, battery is normal it can be retained throughout the day after full charge ,, only con is that fingerprint sometimes not work	4

I get around 5-6.5 hours of screen-on-time with WIFI+4G usage (last 1.5 days)8. Does heat around the volume keys when on 4G, but with a case you won't notice it9.

5389	The phone is working very slow...need to change it...do the needful asap	1
5390	Lg has compromised by not providing speaker in earpiece .so sound output from speaker is not loud enough with maximum volume while receiving call.also bottom speaker has a drawback as it is on backside.also sound output to call receiver is not normal indicating microphone issue with this phone.in other department phone is excellent.But if you are making a phone with basics compromised like sound & microphone than you are killing the phone.	2

5450	I am using this phone from last 8 days I must say overall its a worth of money. It has the best camera, good battery backup, friendly and quick UI, touch and face detection is very smooth.	5
5451	Wonderful performance of LG Q6 , nice display , good battery backup, nice picture quality.	5
5452	I'm going to point out what are the dislikes about this phone.1. Battery life . You get 4-5 hours of SOT if you are simply browsing or doing something else. For gaming  you get only 3 horus of SOT. Even during night time or keeping mobile idle the battery is draining.2. The display. The sunlight visibility is very poor and adpative brightness is inaccurate. Sometimes it doesn't fit with the outside light . Comparing to the realme 2 pro the display is pathetic.3.miNonr bugs. Proximity sensor won't work during call sometimes, minor lags and crash are also there. It's simply because of bugs.hope xiomi will optimize it with later updates.4. Huge camera bump. It protrudes heavily and prone to scratches you need to be very careful otherwise the camera will become unuseful.5. Headphone jack is missing and we have to carry the adapter also. That's a big annoyance.നന്ദി	3
5453	It's nice phone value for money I m playing pubg and works fine. Camera is ok .	5
5454	I like the camera quality, the touch screen sometimes is not very reactive, battery is not good compared to Mi Max 2( which used to give 2 days back up), the camera protruding out is a design fault which  Mi tried to cover by giving a back cover, back cover is actually quiet good	4
5455	Worst proximity sensor...Worst battery backup...Camera 3.5Sound 4.5Process 4	3
5456	Quality product from Lg for sure.Cons-No IR blasterUSB type c missingUI is average	4
5457	Phone is brilliant, but battery life is disappointing & android one is just for saying there is nothing much features in it	4

5526	Thannk you amazon and redmi for such a wonderful product & shopping experience	5
5527	Picture quality and battery life was awesome but having little bit of lag for blue tooth connectivity and downloads.	4
5528	If you wanna buy a mobile phone for clicking pictures... Then go for it.Picture quality is amazing!!! :)	5
5529	The power button is very loose and not responding on time as I am looking into it I am thinking of a replacement	2
5530	Phone lagged too much on using games and stuff. Battery backup is also poor	1
5531	(Very Bad Camera) Comparing with similar range phone (15000/-₹) Like Oppo, Vivo, MI.  They have a Outstanding Camera Quality At least  a good Phone also.  But LG you cheat with us.  All of camera lover please don't buy this for camera.  Other wise phone is okk.	3
5532	I am a heavy user and all my phones specially their battery till date start crying for help after intense usage :D Xiomi has produced a master piece with this one. Gives awesome back up. Redmi 4 also had 4000 mAH battery but never felt so but this Redmi 6 pro is simply awesome. Easy to handle and use in one hand. Awesome touch response. The display notch looks lovely. Just the speaker sound quality could have been improved a lot but still a good buy at this price. Go for it with eyes closed.I got for 6500Rs after exchanging my 2 years old Redmi 4. :)	5
5533	The picture quality of the rear camera is very good...But the front camera is totally useless...Battery life is also good...Sound quality is also good...But i prefer if you are selfie addict go For another phone like Redmii note 5 pro	5

5540	Battery life is Low,Sudden Signal drop, Restarts automatically, Crashing of OS all of a sudden,Sometimes Touch is not working, to make it work i should restart my mobile... I feel Note 5 Pro is far better than MI A2	2
5541	Picture quality In day is very good but in nightIt's turn to poor quality.Sound quality I very good.Battery life is also good one day battery life.	4
5542	Excellent performance but front camera is not goodREAD MORE	5
5543	Phone is very slim, good full screen displayBut the battery is very poor in performanceIts drains in no time.	3

5551	It has been close to a month for now that I had ordered for this product and I would say that this product is amazing. The picture quality is great and after the recent system update, it has been an awesome experience.	5
5552	Bought this device two days back,where I felt device is good but the earphones are really worst and worthless looks cheap ,whereas iPhones have good earphones ..!	4
5553	Dispaly  was Good  and delivered so fast	4
5554	Front camera is very poor....	2
5555	Best for Camera and Battery..100% satisfied..Actually the camera quality is even much better than Redmi y2 or redmi note 5 pro	5
5556	Cam clarity and sound clarity is bit average	4
5557	Product not good.no return policy	1
5558	Good one in this range.. highly recommended	5
5559	fits well in the hands, good for gaming and video playback. sound quality is also better than same range phones	5
5560	Phone is excellent. Look and feel awesome. Performance very good. But facing a sound issue as it goes off time to time and on restart it gets restored. May seek Motorola support to resolve this.	5
5561	Nice Mobile	5
5562	Looks like a flagship device :)	5
5563	Phone is too good but rear portrait mode is not good and flash not working as MI a1 ..	4
5564	It looks good but not good at processor battery backup and display	2
5565	Best phone for the budget. Only major disadvantage it will not support volte for both the sim at a same time	4
5566	Best in its class , i bought with a 3g phone exchange in great indian slae@9500,awesome in this price segment.	5
5567	Camera clarity not good	1
5568	Best mid budget phone. But the speaker is little low and hard to hear in public places.	5
5569	Looks great, colour is good,light weight,but only one issue I have been facing is the head phones jack, it should be on traditional way , giving a cport cable is not comfy, over-all nice product	5
5570	Not good as per the name of redmi, i like only one thing that it is looking very cool, but performance isn't satisfactory. I m not happy with display, battery, camera.	4
5571	Awesome phone with quality. Picture quality is good.	5
5572	sound and picture quality is good and value for money and battery life is ok	5
5573	Camera and timely software updates are a big plus	4
5574	Redmi 6 pro is very good mobile in all respects except sound quality. Picture quality, front and back camera are very good. Battery life is also very good. With data on full day and extensive use of net for 9 hours, the battery ℅ falls from 100% to 75%. I am highly satisfied with this product except sound quality. I listen bluetooth speaker but the Equaliser does not work at bluetooth mode. This problem is common to all MI mobiles.	4
5575	Camera is very bad	2
5576	Very like	5
5577	We get a lot more than what we pay for. Excellent phone. MIUI implementation is awesome.	5
5578	Look nice. Battery OK 1.5 days.  Nouch no use. Sound avg. Notification bar nothing unread item shows. But software may upgrade may there. Battery max 1.5 days. Refer photo. MI playing with add every where. So believe no security to our files and data. I hate this mob.	2

5638	Sir when i get my one time screen replacement warranty card	5
5639	The best thing about this is the original Android flavor and so less worry about apps compatibility. Earlier I used MIUI and honestly, some of the apps (non general use app like slack, skype) had issues syncing. But with this phone all is well.Battery is good enough. In my use case, I can run WiFi hotspot for around 11 hours in a single charge.Pictures quality are good enough, but if you are comparing with some other phones in this range, then you might notice a bit lesser brightness (not much though)About sound, I dont do use speaker mostly. On call sounds are clear and good.If you are looking for stock android and good hardware capability go for it.	5

5720	Battery won't last long for a day....	3
5721	If you are reading this Review that means you already know what this 5.5 incher from LG has to offer so I would like to keep my review short and relevant which might help you decide if you want to buy this phoneThe UI on this phone is quite interesting and fluid The Touch Response is also amazing the Snapdragon 435 processor combined with the  3 GB of RAM offers lag free performance and is able to run most of the high end games at high graphic settings like Asphalt 8 and Modern Combat 5 the build quality is also robustI would suggest you to get a screen guard on this device after six month as LG offers free screen replacement and Gorilla Glass 3 won't catch scratches with the daily useCamera performance for both front and rear cameras is above average and is able to render some good quality photos under good lighting conditions but strugles under low lightThe dedicated SD card slot is an added advantage. the face unlock and double tap to wake up compensates for the fingerprint sensor to some extent though it is not as fast as the latter but its gets the job done.Overall I would like to give a rating of 8 out of 10 for this device.	5
5722	Gr8 phone	5
5723	Worth purchase	5

5771	TL;DR: If you want a really nice display for a really affordable price, this is the phone to buy. The low cost means other aspects of the phone take a hit, but most of them are great and the display is just awesome.You can find very descriptive reviews of this phone everywhere, so I'll just highlight a few key points:The display is hands down beautiful, with slim bezels and curved edges.The design isn't bad with its metal edges, but the back scratches easily, so you'll need some means of protection.The cameras work I guess, but they're not good for low light at all, and the capture process is quite slow. But for the price, you can't really complain.There's no fingerprint scanner, only bio metric security is FaceUnlock, which has its own pros and cons. Major con is, it doesn't work in the dark, so you have to use a pattern or PIN.Battery life for me is great, with 1 1/2 to 2 days of medium use. But no fast charging, so it takes around 2 hours to completely charge. Also, no USB C.Performance is good, as long as you don't demand too much. It handles basic tasks like surfing the web and some multitasking, but the Snapdragon 435 is not meant for gaming or any other heavy use. Don't expect much of it.It also ships with 7.1.1, and is going to get Android 8.0, so that's a plus.All in all, no fast charging, FaceUnlock not working in low light, mediocre cameras and a plastic (kinda cheap) back are the only things I found worth complaining. If they don't bother you as much, go for it.	5
5772	Overall a good device. But a bit large, screen is not that much great if you look closely.	4
5773	There is distortion in voice from the earpiece, cannot hear calls. Need to take calls with earphones or in loudspeaker mode.	2
5774	I have been using this mobile from 10 months.. Battery life is excellent, Picture quality is awesome, Looking so smart and premium mobile	5
5775	loved the product,but lg can improve the face lock.	5

5797	Battery draining so fast, camera is really awesome but rear camera bump is really irritating. Overall phone is gud but not as expected. If you want stock android and excellent camera then go for mi a2 but u want everything gud at this range, I think Honor 8x is better	4
5798	Battery life very poor	3
5799	Value for money. Does all aam aadmi might be looking for.	4
5800	First of all the amazon's service is awesome. They take time but resolves it. Got a replacement in 3 days and picked up the device and gave me another at the same time.Really appriciated.1.The battery is decent.2.Battery charge speed is good.3.The display is good.4.The camera is awesome.5.Performance is really smooth.6.Head phone jack sucks.7.Design is awesome.8.Speaker is really loud.9.Call quality is awesome.10.Just proximity sensor sucks really. Sensor is slow even after I got an replacement for this.The first one was taking 3 seconds after removing the phone from ear and sometime was not working.And the second one is taking 1 second approx.So just disappointed with this sensor as all the other things working very fine.So ok with this thing then go for this.	3
5801	A very good fon with superb battery backup n build quality.. Camera isn't gr8 but not dissapointing either.. Sound output isn't upto the mark but audible at most ambiences except at very noisy and crowd area.. Minor lag are noticed here n there but that's just nitpicking.. Loving the experience.. Also tempered glass n a cover is a must..	4

5807	Phone is not that fast and the battery drains too fast.. its not a worth to be of 17000 . very dissatisfied	1
5808	Really horrible, while talking on the call display is not getting off besides that speaker is turning on, connecting to other call, going mute, flash light is turning on.Adaptive brightness is not working in low light and brightness.Big issue was sensor is not working while talking on the call.	3
5809	All are good. Battery should be more effective.	5
5810	It's very fantastic awesome mobile and nice sound quality. Awesome camera. Nice battery life. Awesome look but I think it's small size.	5
5811	The phone looks great. Size is comparatively bigger. But it's OK.	5
5812	Worth for money. Only draw back is sound jack. None of the wired head phones or ear phones can be used unless you connect a external sound card which comes along with the packing. Still you cannot carry it everywhere.	5
5813	Nothing to hate about this... Looks super cool has big screen and feels premium	5
5814	Wrost phone ever	1
5815	Overall Good Phone	5
5816	Outstanding performance by Asus at this price segment. I suggest you to go for it , if you want a budget smartphone.READ MORE	5
5817	Really liked	5
5818	Very good phone but little bulky	4
5819	I will break it into pros and cons:Starting with pros:Bigger and better display. Best in the price segmentFace unlock and fingerprint is ver responsive and fast.The all new kirin 710 makes it smooth like butterBack camera is awesomeBattery is 3750 but still due to emui aggressive ram management works like 4000 mah.This small notch like one plus 6 is quite pleasing unlike poco f1.Gpu turbo support for higher frame rates and low power consumption.Dedicated npu for the ai support.The buit quality is awesome that u can't get in this price segment as soon as you will hold the phone you will feel the differenceNow cons:Front camera is not as good as expected out of 16 mp.Although it has gpu turbo. Still the mali gpu g-51 is significantly less powerful than is competitor adreno 512 in real me 2pro.(well if you ask me i think gpu turbo is a bit of marketing gimic).No heating issues but with intense pubg your device will get warm.No gorilla glass.VERDICT :totally go for it you can't get a better built quality and better looking phone at this price segment with great back camera and awesome processor.	5
5820	Memory.. Does not have expandable memory so cannot put extra sd card.	3
5821	Everything is ok but camera quality is not as expected, little bit a low in quality	5
5822	Picture quality is decent..so camera is averageSound quality is decentPrice is goodScreen looks very nicePerformance is very good n fastDoesn't heat upOverall a must buy phone	4
5823	It's awesome and for the price	5
5824	The mobile is overall very good except the battery life .	4

5845	Great phone with excellent built quality and great battery life	5
5846	over all its a fantastic product but battery drains a lot. So, if battery dsn't work properly so there is no use.	2
5847	I bought 6Pro - Incoming calls not displayed on the screen from day one.  Called MI call center and they asked me to contact Amazon. I called Amazon to replace the order but it was not worked. I won't recommend buying the products. It is waste of money.	1
5848	I was very excited to buy the Mi A2 since the A1 was a huge success. I am a sucker for stock android experience and good cameras on my smartphone. Fortunately, got this during the first flash sale itself and after almost a month of usage, here are my two cents on this device.PROS1. Build quality is great. I personally dislike glossy glass finishes, and the metallic body of the A2 is premium. It looks like an expensive smartphone and not something that costs less than 20K.2. Software experience is too good. Stock android does not have the bells and whistles of other custom UI, but the clean and clutter-free interface is just so good for a user like me. There is nothing on top of the OS to slow things down.3. Performance is smooth for the most part - The Snapdragon 660 is an able processor, and coupled with stock android and 4GB of RAM, the phone was able to handle daily tasks quite smoothly. I multitask frequently, with at least 5 apps always open in memory at any given time. The experience was smooth, app load times are reasonably fast. I did not notice any stutters. I had the occasional niggle here and there, for example, Chrome crashed on one or two occasions, and the keyboard app would close itself, but these were very rare and did not affect my overall experience.4. Cameras are really good for the price. For 17K, this is hands down the best pair of cameras you can get on a smartphone. You may notice in some online reviews that images come out darker and stale when compared to other phones in the market. This is true, but the Mi A2 captures the actual colors in the shot. It does not brighten the image or increase saturation to make the photo look more vivid. I would prefer realistic photos any day. The rear camera captures a lot of details, and the secondary low light camera gives brighter images, although I noticed more noise in the image. Portrait mode is excellent with spot-on edge detection in most cases. The front camera is also really good. It captures colors accurately and also has a software enabled portrait mode.CONS1. The display could have been better. I am not saying that the display is bad. It is good at this price point, but maximum brightness is low in my opinion. It's not as punchy as other phones in this price segment like the Honor Play or Nokia 7 Plus (I have used both phones as my friends own them), but both these phones are priced higher than the A2.2. No headphone jack. This will not be a problem if you are very careful with things. A connector dongle is included but I  had to search for it many times among my belongings as it is very small.3. Battery is average at best. I don't use the phone heavily, so I can get through a working day with some charge left in it. During weekends, when I use the phone to watch videos or play games, I have to charge it before the day ends. The battery life was not a deal breaker, but definitely one of the weak points of the A2.4. Mono speaker is a problem for me. I knew about this before I purchased the A2. I would've wanted a stereo speaker but this is what you get. The speaker is really loud and get the job done in most scenarios.Overall, Mi A2 is a value for money buy. I feel that I would continue to use this at least until the promised Android version updates are delivered - for the next two years. If you want a daily driver that can handle multi-tasking and take really good photos, then Mi A2 is a no-brainer.	5
5849	Touch is not that much good rest ok	3

MIUI is a bit better.2)no EIS.Overall a very good buy at this price.	5

5879	A good product.It carries a good display and battery life is also fine.Not much of heating issues after extensive usage with youtube,whatsapp calls and browsing.Separate slots for two sim cards(Nano) and expandable SD card.Camera is ok.A product worth its price for the specs offered by LG.	5
5880	Everything about this phone is good. The camera could have been a lil better and I think this will get fine with a software update.I've been using iPhone 6s and I felt honor is better in terms of user experience. It is difficult for me to get out of the Apple ecosystem as I have a mac Pro, 3 ipads, an apple watch, 2 iPhones but I must tell you that making honor my primary phone is a good choice I made. I did not see any wisdom in buying the other flagships from Samsung or any other company, to me it's just showoff or satisfying the ego. I may be wrong here but my usage doesn't demand me to have a flagship and moreover, the specs are also the same.Huawei has really come a long way and I feel it's here to stay.Android has taken a huge leap and is far ahead of ios in terms of user interface and usability. I realised how outdated I was, using iPhone, compared to the latest Android. I also had a blackberry keyone as my standby phone and that has taken the third seat.And yes I got an honor 9n for my employee and was surprised to see seamless connectivity between honor phones.	5

5945	The huwaei Mobiles are just amazing.I fell in love with this brand. Since, i bought honor 7x. I'm using it for almost a year. and its amazing.People who want everything (incld. Camera, Build quality, Processor, display etc.) in less price.Must buy huwaei products. 🤘	5
5946	The phone build quality is good and looks wise its best in the class. The worst part of this is its camera. I mean how can you say that its camera is of 20 MP and that is also with AI. The photos clicked by rear camera seems to be click by a 2mp camera. Earlier i was using mi a1 and its camera is par from honor 8X. I think honor can fix this by update. Until then i will suggest you to buy some other phone like realme 2 pro or mi note 5 pro if camera is your first priority.	2

5958	Writing this review after 2 months of usage....I got to say this is the best phone you can get in it's price range.The features which I liked areAndroid one - regular upadtes and security patchesCamera - just fantasticBattery life - getting around 7 hrs SOT every full chargeOverall I great purchase and totally worth it.	5
5959	This is one of the worst purchases I have ever had. Other than looks, there is nothing good about this phone. This phone doesn't even perform to an extent of 1GB ram. Pathetic ram management, frequent lags in the apps, poor quality cameras in both front and back, unusual keypad are the key things to note.I bought this phone because I didn't want to purchase a Chinese phone this time however, this Korean brand phone is pathetic to use.There are 2 things stands out as a small compensation for the money you paid.1. Looks and display2. Call clarityOverall, this phone is not worth 15k. Better choose some other that has different brand. You can't return this product once you buy. Amazon will ask you to reach out to LG for any issue. I have a major problem of adding files from laptop to the phone. As soon as you drag and drop or copy paste the music files, it says device is locked though the device is unlocked. I have no other way but to reach out to LG as amazon didn't help me with this.Think wise, choose better; choice is yours.	1
5960	After having used this phone for a month, writing this review:Pros:1. CAMERA - the camera quality is absolutely mind blowing. the dual camera setup of 20+12 is the best in the price segment and also unmatched by any higher priced phone except for the One Plus 6. The low light pictures are pretty sharp and there is hardly any noise in the photos. the only place where the One Plus 6 beats the Mi A2 is the dynamic range, but editing the pictures in Snapseed, the levels feel at par, with the Mi A2 producing better saturated photos in daylight conditions.2. PROCESSOR- This phone feel FAST. the new Snapdragon 660 shows the raw juice it gives to the phone. combined with the 4GB of RAM. heavy multi-tasking, split screen usage, playing heavy duty games, none ot it heats up the phone or makes it lag. The fingerprint scanner is so quick that at times its annoying that on a slight nanosecond touch accidentally the phone unlocks.3. BATTERY - Before I bought the phone i read a lot of youtube reviewers spew nonsense about how crap the battery life is, and how it will not give more than 3-4 hours of On-screen time. I have been using it for a month now, and after watching HD vidoes, gaming, Video Calling and using heavy social media apps, I get around 7 hours on an average on cellular data. On wifi, one single charge gives upto 8.5 hours of On-screen time which is absolutely crazy, given that the battery is a 3010mAh battery.4. SOUND - The grilled speaker at the bottom is enough to drown a small room and does not distort the sound quality. On headphones, its pretty decent too ( recommended to invest 3k in a proper headphone if you're hoping to squeeze out the maximum out of this phone's audio capacities. )5. STOCK ANDROID - It's clean, its crispy, its fast. I love it. Stock Android fans, will love it too. And, yeah we are getting Android Pie in all probabilities by the end of this year.Now coming to the cons-1. no dedicated headphone jack- though i dont miss it but at times while traveling when my phone is running out of juice and im charging it on the go, i wish the headphone jack was there so that i could listen to a Spotify playlist and relax.2. aggressive RAM management - some apps are killed a bit too fast for my liking when not in use. but they open pretty fast again so its not much of an issue.3. no fast charger - now this is one thing i wish Xaomi had done better. this phone supports QuickCharge 4.0+, while we are getting a normal 10W charger. the average charging time is 1 hours 20 minutes. I would recommend everyone to wait for 2-3 months to buy a certified 4.0+ Charger is released, instead of buying a QuickCharge 3.0 charger right now.Overall rating from me: 9/10.This phone is as good as it gets.	5
5961	Betty life is very good. Picture quality is very good. Typing with this mobile is not comfortable this is the only problem	4
5962	Display clarity, camera and Battery is superb, look is awesome.	5
5963	This is a good phone.As it has edge to edge display, it look very primium, and convenient to use with 1 ✋, thanks for it's 18:9 screen ratio.Even very good UI from LG. so software part is also✌️.But CPU is not good for heavy use.So I recommend it if u r not gamer.Otherwise it is great phone for daily uses. Specially screen 👌	3
5964	Everything is nice & perfect.	5
5965	There is dust in front camera under the display which is noticable. Quality control is not good. Im going to replace it.	3
5966	I got this on 14th Oct. Why I bought the lg Q6 here I am telling you the best part of lg q61st- it's display is AMOLED . Use it with VR it will give you amazing experience at mid range.2nd- it's unique feature like face ID, full 4k vedio with MX player . When someone call or msg it tells who call or msg you .3rd- it has 425 snapdragon processor which is pretty low but after I am using its enough fr Asphalt 8,Ganstar vegas....etc high graphics game no lacking .it runs smooth.although I saw in you tube vedio and their some reviewer tell tht its lack of processor not it's not.if you compare redmi note4(625snapdragon) and lg q6(425snapdragon) Lg is far better than this at this range.its cornering curve display is marvellous to watch 4k or hd film without using VR.4th-it's 3000mah battery enough to use a day.Thts it.	4
5967	This is very good phn.. Picture quality is also good..performance is fast... Overall.... Very nice mobile in this budget... Very fast delivery... Thank u amzon	5

5969	Fantastic product,,,, 3 days of battery life nd butiful picture quality	5
5970	Sound Quality is low	5
5971	Friends do not buy it. Battery drain is huge issue, plus camera is pathetic and In my case random reboot too, I called customer service , and they say it can be replaced no return, One bad decision and lost 15000. Friends please do not fall for screen,  as even youtube or.vlc will not fit in the whole screen as apps still doesn't support this phone aspect ratio , thus I could not save my money but I hope can save some one else's.	1
5972	Just go for it	5

6003	good feel	4
6004	Redmi is the Best choice	5
6005	Defect device delivered, amazon not replaced.	1
6006	Ordered Huawei P20 Lite phone on 02 May'18 got delivered on 03-May-18 bang on time I was about to leave office. Spend almost 4 days with this new phone, so far doesn't experience any lag in operation but despite fingerprint sensors are fast and accurate most of the time, but at times they behave in such a manner that you'll get suspicious on your finger itself :) . Face unlock is also fast and accurate.Camera is pretty decent though flash on/off feature is little confusing I think with next update huawei try to fix this out. Front 24MP camera is just a miracle it has the capacity of converting Johnny Lever to Shahrukh Khan so all instagram lovers start counting your followers they are definitely going to increase.Call quality on headset is good but not so great on speakers plus on screen call recording feature is not available so little disappointment for those who are in habit of keeping all evidences :)On the gaming front I'm not a gaming buff kind of person so can't comment on the gaming capability of this phone.Overall to sum up if you're getting best exchange value for your existing phone plus additional discounts then only go for it, else ask Hua-wei is Ai-wei.	5

6020	MI A2 is really good and I love the featuresCamera with low light lens is superbDisplay is really good and sound quality is also goodI am using this phone since 10 days and no heating issues.Suggestion for good battery backup is disable 2nd sim if not using frequently and disable notifications for almost all appsDrawback is no fast charger provided in box and no headphones provided by MISince it is Android one phone no background apps running and so it saved battery lifeOverall it is a good phone at this price	5

6050	Good. Slightly over priced.	5
6051	Overall performance of the mobile very good in this price. Amazing mobile with good picture quality and long life battery life and also premium design.	5
6052	Here is a short review on the specs of the phone after one day usage.Looks are fantastic. It doesn't look like a 15k phone, gives a premium feel.Display is just an FHD display. Hence, who use A QHD display previously will dislike this one.Battery is excellent, lasts a day.Performance is average, with just SD435 chipset, it cannot handle heavy apps and even lags a bit in multi tasking.LG new interface is stunning, really impressive.Camera dissappoints, not worthy.Overall a good budget phone but not the best.	4
6053	Got the product before promising date, good work amazon, Product is very nice, Specially Camara quality and battery backup, is amazing. Also the quality of case provided is quite good.	5

6099	Pros :- vibrant color n wide display- good battery Life. Charged within 2hrs to 100%- nice design n descent look- quick face unlocking.- headphone looks cheaper but sound quality is very descent.Cons:- No Conventional LG apps like QRemote, Knock code, Equilizer, advance features of Gallary.- back cover plastic n is prone to scratches.- Description says its Military Standard 810G certified but does not clearly describes if the phone is dustproof or/and spill proof.- speaker is at back side of phone. So ring goes unheard if kept on bed n not sitting nearby.	4

Sound quality is also Ok. Overall performance is awesome no lags. The phone heats up while charging and camera quality should be improved through software updates and it doesn't have EIS . Lastly the phone takes almost two and half hours for charging completely. At this price segment I think this the best phone. Overall I love this phone very much.	4

6186	Its a beautiful phone with premium feel. Fullvision display at this price is really wow. N it feels really good using such a big screen with such a handy overall body. Overall Its a nice phone with enough power to do your daily tasks smoothly. Cant say a gaming machine but you can play more than 80% of the games from playstore smoothly. Descent camera descent specs, cant complain about. Face recognition is good n does its job quiet well.	5

6200	I got myself 4gb 64 gb varient in red color. You can say it is the cheaper version of iphone 10 aka x ,same notch,same camera setup,even same lock screen. Build quality is good , you get 2 sim with dedicated sd card slot,  xiaomi android user interface is full of ad’s. , this annoys me many times. If you want clean user interface then go for stock android phones, mi main problem is that they replace their models very spedly, you never know when your latest mobile become obsolete.	4
6201	Awesome product by mi camera is superb and sound quality is good and i,m happy to purchase this phone 👍	5

6210	Sound in high volume ...is weird	3
6211	First time i have purchased lg phone and it is neither bad nor good just average phone if your requirement is very less like only watching videos, whatsapp, fb and phone call. Front and Camera is good in natural light like other phones. As aperture is 2.2 so cannot expect sharp images in low light. There was an heat problem when first used later this problem didn't occur. I don't think that this phone can be used for high graphics games as I am not game lover so just guessing because of it's old processor. Have a look on the pic i took in natural light.	3
6212	Pretty amazing device, the stock launcher might not appeal to many, but that's no matter. Camera is quite amazing, battery life is good enough, and the display is so good, colour accurate, at least for me, I like warm displays. To conclude, it is a really nice device with commendable processing power and everything else.	5
6213	Picture Quality Good, Sound Is Good but Battery Discharge Soon	4

6219	Camera awesomeSound goodBattery terribleOverall - value for money	4
6220	Picture quality is good in daylight but in the dark the pictures e have too much of noises	4
6221	I have bought this recently.. I feel it's so slim and nice to carry. But few of the things I just wanted to mention..1. Radio jack port is not available .. every time you need to carry external small cable given as USB supported to put radio jack. So need to carry all the times.2. Sound quality.. when I put max then only it is audible clearly. Average if I put.. it's hearing very low. Hence always max required.3. Back camera is not good. Of course given in device spec.4. Battery backup is good.5. Location service will be automatically make on when you open any location services app. So no short cut provided in status bar menu.	4
6222	Camera quality bad	1
6223	Decent look and nice for rough and tuff use	5
6224	Everything is better not perfect but battery is third class if you  use it continues it drain faster . And it hang sometimes processor is not much better	2

6230	I loved the phone, best part its display .with 5.5-inch display it seems like 4.7inch screen.So you can hold the phone in single handle very easily.But I find 1 drawback, that sometimes phone heats up after browsing internet and battery backup is not very great .	4
6231	What a hell kind of product is it mi a2. I have purchased it and face the issue for the audio jack after that i have taken a replacement for such and when i got the same phone the issue itself repeat with this phone too.there is no value for this hell kind of product which mi is offering to its customers.	1

6243	Had been a MI use from past few years , I personally had a Redmi 2 which i used for 2 years.  How ever this Phone Note 6 Pro's camera is not that great I had better exceptions, hopefully i have  settle for the 4 GB ram and 64 GB memory, lets see if this helps.  Rest all features are great the Built quality , sensors and blah blah blah ! Could have made an Youtube unboxing video to recover some extra cash XD Over all M eagerly waiting for the Mix 3 to gift my self next year	4
6244	Don't by any LG mobile customer & repairing services is worst even during guarantee period	1
6245	Im satisfied with this, really glad i bought it. One month no problems. Battery is amazing	5

6284	It does have notch display but it has lot of problem in display.I have never seen such horrible instability in display by MI. It is also due to their high standard I feel quality of this phone is very bad in display.Sound quality is ok. But normally I have faced issue in sound quality while in call and Also playing media.Battery is good now.  But it will take lot of time to test it. We can say at present not much heating.	3

6289	"After using 1 week my review please read carefully if you want to purchase lg q6.Pros:1. Fresh naugat experience.2. Full vision display3.small in size like 5"" phone. Its size is similar to redmi 4.4. Split screen optin.5.Cons:1. Lack of fingerprint scanner2.in low light conditions face unlock is not working.3.camera quality is lower than redmi note 4 which is i am using earlier.4. Percentage of battery draining during night during no use of phone is very high.About 18% battery drains during night during no use which is the main reason i want to selling it now.5. For heavy users battery is not sufficient for a day.6. After using redmi note 4 this phone looks me waste of money.I purchase it only for full vision display which satisfies me but this phone have certainly main issue with battery and lack of fimgerprint scanner because face unlock does not saves multiple photos.it saves at a time only one photo in different light condition.It does not allows after some days to add photos in different places because to recognize face it gibes only 1 min to save it. And saves photos in only in that perticular min."	3

6309	Some times Finger lock is not working properly.	3
6310	I wanted a non chinese mobile and thats why preferred LG Q6 after reading initial reviews. but I must say those reviews were totally misleading and pushed me to the trap. You are paying just for the display and nothing else. Poor Audio, front camera sucks(iphone 4 front cam is better after these many years), and gets heated up for no reason. Not fast charging, cheap ear plugs and just GOD knows why the hell i paid so much and bought this. I have requested for a return and refund. Update: Amazon didnt refund, sent LG trchnician and he told everthibg is fine. Its hard earned money.. dont spend on such stupid brand and seller who doesnt take responsibility.	1
6311	Very light weight and performance is very good	4

6317	Best phone under ₹15000. Go ahead and buy without any second thought	5
6318	Pros- Battery back up, back camera, display, fingerprint seasor, face unlock are good. No heating issue of battery during charge.Cons- front camera is not good, it is below average, No front flash. The price should be below 10k.	4
6319	Its better to choose other at this price TBH	3
6320	Volume and power buttons are not working, just after 16 days of purchase..	1
6321	buy blindly	5
6322	battery life verry poor	1
6323	Reviewed after 2 weeks of usageVery similar to the reviews, i had gone through before purchasing the mobile.ProsBuild quality: top class - original NOKIA type (brick type :) ), looks very beautiful. (I don't really care about new 18:9 screens, fingerprint sensors, bezel less notch designs)Performance: very good, smooth running of apps, no laggingCharging: Fast charging, though not as fast as moto turbo chargers.Display: Sharp and ClearSpeaker: Quite loud and clearConsHeats while charging, cools down equally fast after unplugging / full chargeBattery life good, but not Nokia's standard. I don't use for gamings or videos, just calls, whatsapp, mails and very less browsing. after a full charge at 7:30AM, battery remains are less than 30% at 7:30PM. It survives 24hrs, provided i don't use it much after reaching homeCamera:Day light performance: ExcellentArtificial light performance: Good (i use google camera app. Nokia camera app, that i was a big fan of in my lumia 730 days is a big disappointment)Low light: very poor. reviews were already poor. but i had hoped (from my lumia 730 experience) that 4s shutter speed, zeiss lens and (lumia) pro camera app will help, but no use. my lumia 730 clicks far better unrealistically good night time photographs. this mobile can't come near to it. all it produces is noise and pink violet grains. but i feel that no smartphone in 15k range will be able to give good low light photographs. Lumias were exceptions :-|Selfie: Good, i don't click muchVideo: Good, i don't record muchAnother thing that i personally miss in this phone (again comparing to existing Lumia 730) is absence of motion sensor (that is probably still with microsoft). That used to give me exact count of steps while walking, running etc. google fit data is unreliable.	4
6324	Best mobile ever, Good camera rear and front both, no hanging and heating	5
6325	Awesome phone by xiaomi...1.Screen-Excellent2.Picture-Excellent3.Battery-Good4.Look- Awesome	5

6397	The size of the phone is too small when compared with its competitors. This is way too disappointing about the phone and I can not return this phone now because the policy says so. Even the camera quality is too average.	1
6398	I use it for a week and I am writing my honest experience about this sir smartphone. This is a new mid range and set with feel of flagship smartphone LG G6. Here I will tell you measure advantage and disadvantage and why to buy this a smartphone.please  UPVOTE appreciate the effort.#############Advantage-#############1) it has a duel SIM card slot with dedicated Micro SD card slot. Nowadays many phones like MI comes with the hybrid sim slot in hybrid sim slot you can either place to SIM card at the time or a SIM card and memory card at a time you cannot place three of them at the same time so it is a good advantage in this is smartphone that it has particular slots.2) crystal clear 5.5 full HD screen which gives a good quality response you can watch movies on it.3) frame is made of 7000 grade aluminium.4) face recognition knock Code for unlocking the phone.5) OTG cable supported.6) NFC supported by the device so you can perform certain task and transfer money easily.7) built on military standard 810G certification.########Disadvantages########1) the under power processor for multitasking or heavy gaming.2) no type C USB Slot is provided but which is not a big deal.3) the battery is non removable.4) the camera especially secondary is not so good.5) speaker located at the back which do not have good sound.6) it is very disappointing to see the mid range smartphone without fingerprint sensor.##############Why to buy this Smartphone##############LG decided to launch its flagship looking phone under the affordable range by cutting the price and features so finally LG q6 in the market. Full version 5.5 inch full HD display which looks incredible while holding in the hand and putting them on the table. The processor is not expected but definitely delivers a decent performance. 8 lacs in heavy gaming. While under the same price segment you can also check out Nokia 6 Lenovo k8 note redmi note 4 and moto G5 Plus.★★★★please UPVOTE to appreciate my efforts★★★★	4
6399	Nice Deal Nice Phone Nice Delivery and Nice Amazon🌷🌷🌷	5
6400	I bought this phone mainly because of the battery life it claimed. However, I am very disappointed by its performance so far. The model is good,the camera is good. This is the only issue I have. It drains very fast.	3
6401	I have gifted this to relative and her feedback is good.	5
6402	"The phone looks really good, sound quality is nice, display is very good especially 6.5"" full display. The batter life excellent and i could use entire day with just one time charge. Use the phone cover to avoid finger print marks. Good value for the money."	4

6404	overall performance is excellent.	5
6405	Tough the phone's performance didnt concern me a lot, the color did.The color displayed on the Amazon website is completely different to that of the actual one.The actual phone represents Magenta - Something like a pink.	3

So video size became small due to its aspect ratio . you feel like watching on 5"" screen display.For game and video lover this phone doesn't meet your requirement s.Only for look and landy phone ."	1
6411	Sound quality is good but slightly lower compared to other smartphones. Battery will easily last for a day ever after heavy usage. Picture quality is good, AI feature enhances the picture color.Cons:No fast charging support	4
6412	A good package in this range.... Camera is not so good, but fine.... But i can say, the looks of a phone is 10/10..	5

6426	Superb phone. Excellent product by LG - complete value for money. It's a very compact handset without compromising on the screen size. I don't think any other phone even comes close to it - even products of double the prize of this handset have a real competition. LG you have done it - now just keep on improvising on these kind of offerings and you will kill the competition.Actual feel of the product is much better than one would think looking at the pictures and the price. Touch is super smooth, screen is brilliant, dimensions are practical.Premium, classy product.	5

6431	This is my first MI phone and probably the last. Within first two weeks speaker stopped working and i am doing multiple follow ups with Mi Service center at Karve Road Pune and even after a week there is no commitment given when it will be repaired. I am also doubtful about technical capabilities of the engineers working in the center. Never expected such a poor quality service.	2
6432	I found the quality and workablity of this model is excellent	5
6433	I hate this one i exchanged it with redmi 3s prime .my old phone is better than this.no full screen in youtube,jio tv .when coming to charging its horrible taking 2.30hours to charge	1

6436	This is great product Delivery is fast by Amazon service and phone is very good	5
6437	Great picture quality, also a notch phone in this price bracket (Got at discounted price of 16999). Camera quality is also good but main drawback is the speaker sound. Even in a quiet room, it's really tough to hear when the call or media is playing via speaker. Overall 4 stars	4
6438	Phone is just an upgrade to Redmi note 4 with a notch display..But camera let's us down	4
6439	Best phone at this price, not getting hot ,but battery .	5
6440	The product delivered on time.Nice looksSleek, HandyFront camera is good but I didn't like the back one. Too much contrast . not showing the original color.So not satisfied with the camera .	4

6475	Great performance i have no word to explain	5
6476	Nice product and service	4
6477	Best product ever seen	5
6478	This is the best phone under 18k, I think. It's performance is so good having a 4 gb ram with kirin processor. The camera is amazing as it comes with an AI optics. And the battery life is enhanced. But sound quality is just good. It could be better.	5
6479	Very good phone for me and i can handle it very easily also size is very comfortable i can carry in my pocket every where..	4
6480	If u don't care about the camera performance..It won't let u down on any other segments..Camera is worst honor 6x is better in camera..PUBG hangs..Excellent battery	2
6481	Phone is good but Camera has lot of noise that sucks.noise on photovideo recording qualityphoto qualityover exposure	4
6482	Battery is superbbb..., it will come two days, camera average and notification not showing properly.	5
6483	Good smartphone at this price point. The call quality and camera are average. The device heats up, but not at alarming rate. Overall its a good buy. Bought it as its a non-Chinese and make in India product.	4
6484	This product is very well built and in less price we get a lot of features	5
6485	Very good phone camera & music & big sound	5
6486	Very Comfortable in hand feeling for daily usage.. Very good Battery life and a Super Camera setup under 11k.bt Selfie Camera is poor .	5
6487	My purpose is solved after buying this product.	5
6488	Writing this review after 4 days of usage. This phone is just awesome and beats otger competitiors like the xiaomi in many aspects.Pros:1. The screen is just awesome. It feels like you are holding a flagship phone in your hand.2. The build quality. I'm sure enough that whenever you're going to take the phone out from your pocket it's gonna be head turner especially because of the glass back.3. The AI camera4. The battery5. The gaming experience6. The tactile buttonsCons:Just one that honor should have given a usb type c port.	5
6489	Perfect mobile in budget of 10k	5
6490	I liked the full display screen.	5
6491	Only battery backup should have been at least 4000mph.	4
6492	The only thing this phone excels is in its great looks. All other aspects feel cheap about this phone.The biggest let down is browsing. Multiple windows hangs the phone. The google map another problem. It takes forever to show directions even when updated(update- the Google map is working normal now). The phone in general feels very slow and unresponsive. I used to use Redmi note 4 and was quite impressed by its performance.Battery life is just decent. Camera is good.	2
6493	No specific comments	5
6494	Phone is too good but its disply is not strong..single slip in my hand and display is totally damage..Picture and sound both r too good..last one thing must make strong display	5
6495	Small & compact 18:9 camera smartphone with google assistant	5
6496	Superb phone, has all features, runs fast with multiple apps, strong and reliable battery	5
6497	Tasteful would be the definition of the product's ability to take photos, worthy of comparision with other flagship phones. The sound quality would suffice any audiophile with the add-on of snapdragon audio+ sound manager (which unfortunately is not available after the Android P update). The battery life is pretty decent as I've tested it by playing pubg for several hours with full brightness and moderate graphics. This phone fulfilled all the expectations from a low budget phone. Powerful and snappy processor clubbed with a big ram provides you all the fun needed. And lastly the screen is a joy to look at with brilliant contrast and enough brightness to enable you to use the phone even with the sun atop your head.	5
6498	All features are good...but its weight  little bit more compared to other phones...	4
6499	Can buy other product with this range	4

6539	"I bought this phone for a friend who just wanted a practical phone in the Rs10k price bracket. So, I got him this phone and it is surprisingly good. Let me explain it from a practicality viewpoint.Pros-1. CAT6 modem - This is the most important thing for a phone in my opinion, yet no one talks about it! For those who don't know, this is the number which indicates the maximum speed supported by the 4g modem inside this phone. Usually, the phones in the price range come with CAT4 modem which just has a single antenna and supports a max of 150Mbps. However, this phone has a CAT6 modem which has two antennas and supports up to 300Mbps. Now, these are maximum ratings and in the real world, the difference is that CAT4 can max get you 25Mbps, while CAT6 can get a max of 90Mbps.You can get these speeds only if the network tower at your location also supports CAT6 with Carrier aggression. In India, Airtel and Jio are upgrading many of their towers to support this, and at many locations, it has been already available for two years now, especially in Kerala and major towns & cities. Having two antennas also improves network reception, so you get a steady signal while traveling etc.High-end phones like Samsung Note 9 supports CAT18 and all, but anything over CAT12 is useless because no cellular network in the world supports that much speed and they never will because they will next move to 5G. In my opinion, no one should buy a phone with a modem that is less than CAT6 in 2018 as everyone is constantly using 4G for everything.2. Good Build Quality - When you hold this phone in your hand, you will feel like you are holding a premium sturdy phone. It feels quality due to metallic build, good glass in the front and the optimum weight. If you have ever held any of the recent Redmi phone, this feels exactly the same.3. Good Display - The full HD resolution is the perfect resolution for a phone as even if you closely inspect it, you will not be able to see any pixels. No one needs any resolution more than it. Apart from that, this panel has a really good contrast ratio with deep blacks, and I love that. The colors feel like it is popping out, and playing videos on it is a great experience.4. Great Battery - After all of the above points, the next important point for a normal person is battery life, and this phone's 4000Mah batter provides us with over two days of use. So, you don't need to have battery-anxiety.5. Good Wifi - Today, everyone needs to use Wifi and it is important to have a good wifi range. For that, not only you need a good router, but you also need good wifi modem in your device, and this one has a good modem with good range. It also supports 5Ghz frequency if you need it. I was able to get 1.5x more range from my router with this phone than a 3-year-old phone.6. UI - Xioami's version of Android is a very feature rich. It is good for most people but I personally don't like it. However, their next MIUI 10 is super awesome. I love that one. I am sure this phone will get upgraded to MIUI10 soon and its gesture-based navigation is fantastic. Even in the current version of this phone, I went to settings and chose the gesture-based navigation and I was able to use the phone in a more fluid way with it than with the old style button-based navigation. I found that even those who are not familiar with technology is able to use the gestures better than the onscreen buttons.7. Super fast fingerprint reader. It is surprisingly fast and accurate.8. Good speakers - It is a mono bottom firing speaker, but it is loud and clear. It is as good as any redmi phone.10. Headphone jack - This needs to be mentioned because many phones dont have it nowadays.11. Good processor and SOC - I know snapdragon 625 is almost a two-year-old processor, but it is good for most people. You will not see any lags due to this. Everything works smoothly. Although, if you are a super heavy user, like a gamer, then you should go for higher priced phones with better processors. For average to mid-level users, this is more than enough.12. Good RAM. - 3GB RAM is good for most regular people. It allows for plenty of multitasking. Actually, more RAM doesn't impact the performance much. The only thing it does is that you will be able to open more apps at the same time. So, having too much of RAM is not going to be useful if you do not open like 15 apps simultaneously and keep it running in the background. 3GB is the ideal size for 95% of the people out there. People buy phones with more RAM because it is an easily marketable number for the companies and not because more RAM is actually useful.It is like buying a tempo traveler instead of a car because a tempo traveler has 15 seats while a car has only 5. But, you only travel with 4 people 99.9% of the time. So, not only are you wasting fuel with the tempo traveler, but you are not even getting any use out of it. That is the same scenario with those who buy phones with 6 or 8GB RAM. Those extra rams are like the unused seats of the tempo traveler.13 - Smudge resistance - I like that the back side doesn't attract fingerprints and dirt like the flagship phones of today which are made of glass. It is really practically awesome.14- Good GPS reception - Again, practically this is one important feature to travel around.15- I personally don't like notch, but it seems to be done pretty well in this case. I didn't face any problem due to the notch. I wish if the curves around the display was a little less. Currently, it feels like it is too curved.Cons-1. Very low power LED light. This phone has only one LED light, and most people in India use their phones as a torch at least once in a while, so it is practically very important. This one's brightness was like 30% compared to an LG G3 with two LEDs. In my opinion, all phones should have a dual LED with good brightness.2. Average camera - The cameras are good enough for 80% of the people. It takes okayish photos, but it is not comparable to the LG G3 or Pocophone or any high-end phone. It is good for the price, but nothing extraordinary. I found the photos to be too soft, like lacking sharpness or losing details, however, you can see these imperfections only if you zoom into the photo and check it. So, if you are not pixel peeping, it is a good enough camera for you. However, don't expect it to take as good photos as expensive phones. Even at this 10k price point, you might find other phones with a slightly better camera. Even the portrait bokeh effect was not good with it blurring the edges of the face. The videos are also of average quality. Don't mistake this as ""poor quality"", this camera still produces good enough photos which are perfectly usable for everything. Just that it is not as good as higher priced phones. Indians generally make it sound worse than it actually is, and I see the same phenomenon in the review section here.3. Lack of Gorilla glass - I don't know if this glass has any sort of protection, so it might easily get scratched. It is highly recommended that you buy a screen protector as the specs don't talk about any scratch resistance. I think to make a phone practically useful, it needs some good quality glass with protection.4. Thick bezels all around - This is not really a problem at least in this price range, but the bezels on all four sides are thicker than other phones. There is a large chin, thick side bezels and thick top bezel above the notch. Again, I didn't face any problem due to this, but it diminishes the looks/beauty of the phone.5. Lack of fast charging - No phone in this price range provides it, but I just wanted to mention it as some people might need it. You need to double the price range to get this feature.6. MicroUSB - The world is moving towards USB-c, so I think even budget phones should start having this, but again no big deal. And I don't think any other phone is providing it at this time.7. Old design - Xioami has been using this same design language for the past four years. So, it is a highly overused design which has now become kinda boring for techies like me. It is very much practical, but not exciting or beautiful.----------Comparison with other phones - If you want a camera phone or a gaming phone, this is not the one you should get in my opinion, instead, you should spend much more, like 21k for the poco F1. But, the value difference between this phone and poco is around 15% for most people. You are getting a significantly better camera & processor, that's all, and you are paying 2x more money for it. So, you need to think carefully on how you are going to use this phone, and remember that you can still play 99% games in playstore smoothly in this phone itself and that it can take good enough photos.Overall, you are basically getting a good phone at a very optimal price point. There is nothing much you are losing out by not going for a more expensive device. In my opinion, there is only about 15% difference between this phone and the phones sold at 20k and about 30% difference in a phone sold at 35k to 100k price range. So, 10k is a good price point at which you are getting the maximum value for money. I wouldn't suggest going below this price range as well, as then you will start losing out on quality and display resolution. In short, 10k is the price you should pay for getting the most value for money phone you can buy, and Redmi 6 pro is an excellent choice for that.I hope you find this review helpful. :)"	5

6588	Good, thank you	5
6589	At first I want to say honestly that Flipkart is a third class  cheat company. Never buy any electronic product from Flipkart. It doesn't make a refund even after a faulty product received. Flipkart simply fools the customers. Kindly avoid purchasing electronic goods from Flipkart. Once you got a faulty product than think that your money has just gone. We are paying for a right product not for a faulty product. So beware brothers and sisters.READ MORE	1
6590	Nice phone in sub 15k range with stock Android. Only the camera ( portrait mode ) are not up to the mark and it doesn't have slow motion video option. Picture quality is fine. Battery is one of the USP for this phone, it's huge 5000mah and gives you a good back up compared to any other phone in this segment. UI is smooth. Performance vise it's a match winner in sub 15k range. Overall if you are looking for performance and battery, here this phone suits you the best. #onepowerREAD MORE	4

6618	Well!Hello dear reader, writing this review after use of everything 6 + months. I own a #3/32 Gb Variant.The first thing on my mind was like whether should I make the sacrifices which I did make, to pick this device in contrast to others which were better in terms of hardware and other such specification in the same price range. Truly in my personal experience, it was worthy (#a_personal_opinion)I have been a rough user so I picked this device based on the factors like the military certified standard for its rough and tough usage. I had serious accidental drops of the phone, on an average of 5 to 6 feet, still, the phone is Dent-free ❤PROS:1) A very durable, slim and sturdy, compact, handy device. Physical buttons on the phone are great and tactile.2) A very great display (sharp and vivid) and aspect ratio is ... Hats off ❤3) Good quality earphone and charger included (a personal opinion again)4) A very well optimised battery performance and standby time is really fabulous.5) Good quality earpiece and microphone equipped.6) For me, Rear camera is quite for decent! Also the camera software interface of LG is way much better than other brands.7) Perfectly balanced preinstalled Software and Utilities are there! Loved the UI (Including everything.. Gallery, Music Player, File Manager, Settings, Etc.) and Features. Lock Animation is favourite part.8) Separate Ejector Trays for Micro-SD and Sim cards (SIM 1 + SD Card) and (SIM 2)CONS:1)  No pre-installed Equaliser (missing factor), Still it sounds great. Although it’s have been assured that with the Oreo's upcoming updated version of Android for this device they have included the 3D surround sound.2) It lacks the fingerprint sensor, Wasn’t a deal breaker thing for me!3) The phone is having a mediocre-sized imaging sensor in the front, that's why having an average camera quality rather than other phones of the same resolution. But Selfies Turns out to be great in daylight than many devices sometimes.4) Face unlocking isn't that much up to mark in low lightning conditions, fails most of the time.5) Missing Miracast (Screen-sharing/mirroring on smartTV is not possible)6) Aluminium frame gets hot on heavy usage.That’s all folks, from my overall experience, which I was able to put into words …P.S. It’s a Request, as I’ve been through few Reviews( it has an above Average Snapdragon, with a Fair GPU… ) Don’t expect it to be a gaming phone! It’s a DURABLE and Sturdy MID-RANGE phone. If your expectations are high, go and get a Phone from other brand, but please, don’t criticise LG and its Phones	5

6620	"The phone's pretty decent. Really great build quality. It has dropped multiple times and survived with no scratches on the perimeter. This phone changed my conception of ""build quality"" in a smart phone. It even survived a fall from my pocket on the road when i was traveling at about 50km/hr.Poor battery life though.P.S. - Bought this for 16k when it launched. Now it's available for 9k. FML!"	3
6621	But not looking like 16m colours looking like old black and white tv screen.	4
6622	Great to New	5
6623	LG did it...The phone is elegant, premium looking and has a very good build quality. Full vision and still a handy size makes it a very good fit for me. Definitely worth buying this classy phone. It will stand out among others. Will post detail review again after exploring all functions.	5
6624	nice mobile in 8K	5
6625	Batterlife we have to think of external charger	4
6626	Worst mobile ever and for ever.	1
6627	Good and safe delivery and huawei is unbeatable​ company for it's performance and low light photography is awesome	5
6628	I loved this phone very much and the main thing is that the camera and the battery.	5
6629	Bought it on first day of Diwali sale. Got good discounts because of this it came under my budget. When it came, it seems like I have bought a 40K phone. Blue color variant looks elegant and stylish.Speed will make you think that what else is left to overcome after this processor. It is enough for doing anything we normal users do, so why to spend more for high end processors like in One Plus 6/6T or iphone.  My migration from old phone to new phone along with all previous apps is done in less than 30 mins.Camera is the best feature of this phone even before its speed. Both front and back camera are better than many digital cameras which we carry on vacations.Finger print unlock works good. No lags even with wet fingers.One more good thing is,, it will get Android Pie upgrade soon.Only negative point is its battery life. I was using MI 3s prime earlier which was giving me 2 days of battery life after one recharge. So I was little disappointed when it drains out in 1 day for MI A2 even for normal usage.Verdict: If you have no problem in recharging daily (low battery life), then this phone can be easily compared with other phones which are in range of 30-40 K. So you will be very happy to spend only around 14K and to get all those good high end features.Buy this phone if your budget is 13-14k. PERIOD.	5

6767	"I bought this as a secondary phone, to complement my iPhone 7 plus, and replace my OnePlus One (OPO). In a nutshell, this phone is a decent buy which does not disappoint you but neither does it amaze you.What's Good:1. Screen: The screen, which is the USP of this phone, lives up to the promise. Good colour reproduction, good maximum brightness level, and very responsive touch.2. Form factor: This form factor suits me more than that of iPhone 7 plus, or of the OnePlus One. Though I prefer the larger screens for videos, they can cause your hands to tire. No such problem with this phone. If I am forced to use only phone in the future, i'd rather go for a phone this size than the larger phones which are in vogue.3. Build Quality: This was, pleasantly, the biggest surprise to me. The phone feels very solid and is good to hold and also to look at. I love using it without a cover. The quality of plastic is very good, and does not feel ""plasticky"" unlike some of the phones in this price range.4. Signal Reception/Call Quality: This, along with the lack of VoLTE support, is the reason why I had to give up the OPO. Unfortunately, basis online reviews and forums, most companies have not been able to figure this out. Missed incoming calls, random network drops, and failed outgoing calls are common complaints of users, especially when phones have to toggle between 4G and 3G/2G signals. This phone is awesome at this. If the ""phone"" in ""smartphone"" is crucial to you, skip the Chinese brands and blindly go for this phone.5. Battery: Some reviewers have complained about the battery and SoT (screen on time), but I am completely satisfied with this aspect. The battery lasts me for about a 1 to 1.5 days. However, my usage is not very high as this is my secondary phone.6. Micro USB: Unlike many of the other reviewers, I'm glad that this phone has a micro USB and not USB-C, simply because the former is ubiquitous and everyone has a cable lying around. I hate having to deal with too many cables, and i'm glad that I can reuse charging cables from my other devices.7. Headphone jack: Well, I didn't expect that this would be counted as a ""pro"" in the phone, but Apple has made me realize it's importance ;) It can get a bit tedious to pair bluetooth devices, so it's a welcome relief that if I need to make a quick call using handsfree, I can use this phone rather than my other phone for which I shelled out a fortune.What could be better:1. UI: It's infuriating why companies don't stick to the stock Android experience. Fortunately, there is not much bloatware and the UI is bearable. But still, the ""almost"" stock experience on my OPO was superior. All in all, this is a minor grievance, if at all.2. Performance: In itself, the performance is not bad, but it's strictly average. While I didn't expect this phone to be a blazer, it still rattles that the OPO felt so much ""faster"" than this. And, the OPO was launched three years before this phone. Well, to be fair, that was a flagship and this is a mid-range phone. Anyway, I don't play ""heavy"" games, and this phone has always felt adequate. I've not faced any lags, and nor has the phone ever hung on me, which I cannot say even of the mighty iPhone 7 plus.3. Facial Recognition: This works around 60% of the time. It disappoints when the room is not very bright, or if you don't hold the phone at a particular angle. I end up entering my pin most of the time.4. No fingerprint sensor: If there was one reason why I would not buy this phone if given a choice again, this would be it. Coupled with the fact that the facial recognition is strictly average, it gets tedious to enter a pin. Especially, after the iPhone has spoilt me with the wonderful scanner built into it. Moreover, much cheaper competitors have this feature, though I can't comment on their quality or efficiency. Anyway, I cannot hold it against the phone as I knew what I was getting when I bought the phone.5. Speaker volume: Again a minor grievance, but I like to have ""loud"" phones. The speaker volume is a bit underwhelming, though not a deal breaker in any way.No strong opinion:Accessories: I haven't used the accessories that came with the phone, such as the power adapter, charging cable, and the headphones. They are still unwrapped and kept in the box. However, the adapter looked ""big"", but that's hardly any useful feedback :)Summary:Go for it if making and receiving calls is important for you, and you prefer a solid build quality and a good screen. Skip it if you play ""heavy"" games, punish your phone with crazy multi-tasking, or hate typing in a pin or pattern to unlock your phone."	4

Front camera is not upto the mark for 24 MP. The display and look only good in this mobile. And charging part is also taking more than 2 hrs for full charging. Not worth for 20k price.	1

6804	I got a defect piece. Mobile doesn’t turn ON. It gets restarted automatically and a continuous white screen appears. The process for replacement is really worst. Instead of sending a technician to home, it would have been better if there was a direct product replacement and manufacturer can take HELL LOT of TIME in this WORLD to resolve such filthy issues rather than wasting our time. No use by having PRIME account.	1

6817	I have not received a mail as of now about my 1 year screen replacement.	3
6818	Its been 3 months now since I have been using this phone so here is my review of the phone.The box contains the main unit, sim ejector pin, a 2A Huwaei charger, an standard usb cable, a silicon cover and some user manuals.The phone feels premium in hand. The glossy glass at the back looks stunning. I have the blue variant and it is gorgeous to look at. The silicon cover adds protection to the phone but it gets yellowish over time. The phone is very smooth to use out of the box and the 4gb ram feels sufficient to do multitasking, although I do not keep any activity in the background. I play PUBG at times, the phone doesn't heat up and the battery drain is acceptable. The battery life is great, with standard use of facebook and instagram I get a backup of 1 and half day. The charging speed is good too. The screen is big and vibrant and viewing angles are great. The screen has a plastic film pre installed for protection and it has been serving me well. The camera could have been better but I guess future updates will improve that too. The AI mode in camera gives vibrant photos and there are a lot other options to play with too. Overall, its a great phone from Huwaei untill Huwaei disappoints us with software updates.	5

6879	Performance is very poor and screen touch also not respond quickly.	1
6880	It's been 5 months since I bought this device. Lag free with no troubles. The finger print sensor needed a bit of acclimatization to use, since i switched from a Motorola device which harbours the sensor on front rather than rear.Courtesy Android One programme, the updates are delivered as when they r released.Overall, it was a device worth buying.For future buyers - Go for the Nokia 6.1 Plus	5

6890	Delivery within 24 hours.	5
6891	Well this is my first Honor phone .Delivery was very fast , it was supposed to come on Sunday but it came on Friday so I am very happy with such service .Now I am writing review after using it for 2 days , I will keep updating this comment after some use of mobile .Body :After opening the packet the first impression was WOW !!! the glass back body looks really elagant and beautiful simultaneously .The front screen amazes you with good screen to body ratio. Usually I hate phones with  large brezel border on bottom but this phone has a very small or u can say neglible brezel.Preloaded Apps :The pre-installed apps are very less only Google package takes most of the space in pre installed package.Camera : The camera is great and AI   is successfully remastering photos with more vivid and vibrant colour  . There is slow Mo modes , potrati with Bokeh etc .Processing : I played some giant games like pubg , spider man 2 and PES , and I never felt like that it is lagging so it is a good sign that Kirin is doing some work behind the scenes .Heating : I have observed some heating problem but its minute and don't be a bother for me .Google Lens : the Google assistant comes with Google Lens which is pretty good .Battery : Well I think that battery is draining a little bit faster than my old phone , I think may be I need to tweak some settings to get the best out of the battery .	4

6915	Phone was very heated when I'm put into charging......	3
6916	I was a fool 😭 to purchase Samsung phone again, once I purchased long back Galaxy 3 when it was launch & I spend almost 20000/- to replace the display 4 to 5 times, after I stopped buying Samsung phone, close to 6 year now, last December I bought Samsung J8 & it fall down yesterday even after phone cover & screen guard the display got damage, I think they purposely make phone like that, I will recommend never buy Samsung phone, obviously how much you take care phone will sometime will fall down.	2

6932	Worth buying this phone, too good camera quality  for both front and rear camera but you just need to compromise for battery backup.	4
6933	ok no comment using yet dont now	4
6934	Poor camera . wrong specification . work like vga camera in night photo shoot. Device heatup near to volume button	1
6935	Not a reliable phone. Many a times,it's finger scanner is not working. It's response to user input has become slow. There is lag in key press and swipe action.	1
6936	I bought this phone during the recent festival sale and got a great deal on it. Post exchanging my old phone, Amamzon discount & bank cashback... i had to pay around 10k for this phone...which i fell is a great deal! The delivery was on time and they also took the old phone (flipkart charges you for this process).The phone itself is quite nice. Lightweight, sleek, bright screen, fast processor and battery that lasts around 30 hrs on one charge for regular usage (watsapp, candycrush, youtube, music, short calls etc). The faceunlock and finger print scanner are fast. 3GB ram processor does make it super fast. The camera is also very good. I would recommend this phone for a budget conscious user	5
6937	Front speaker problem.... Within 20 days	1
6938	Phone is good as expected, the earphone is not good and old fashioned earphone. Display is good, camera quality is ok but not up to the mark and Good Battery Life, overall nice product,	4

6945	Picture and sound quality are good but there is no inbuilt 4G video calling feature.	2
6946	Using mi A2 for a week I came to know few things ,so before buying this phone u might wanna take a look few following things---1.First of all the best feature of this phone it's camera back (20+12)mp and front (20mp)[with Led flash],it will beat almost every other phone worth 15k-24k when u compare it's camera with them,4k video recording is available2.The display of this phone is very good in general (no notch),easily visible in Sunlight with Max brightness3.Its processor which came with snapdragon 660 , But I tell u guys  it's not as fast as 660( I felt),But overall Performance is good and fast4. RAM (4gb) management is good and really smooth5.Now For The PUBG and other gaming lovers out there , I tell u guys this phone runs pubg Soo smoothly and so vibrant ..one of the best device to run Pubg..Highest setting available for pubg in this device -Graphichs [HDR] Frame rate [HIGH]6.Now it's battery ,Battery backup is poor if I compare  with the other smartphone at this range ....comes with 3010Mah battery.. still it will run 6-7hrs with YouTube and gaming stuffs7.camera bump is bit too much8. Overall the phone looks  amazing and very fast9.Rare Finger print scanner is really fast10.Best thing it comes with Stock Android (Android One 8.1) , So u will get all the updates first on this device11.The sound quality is really good , But no 3.5mm jack ,U will get a adapter  for ur earphones/headphones [TYPE C TO 3.5MM ]So mind it either u can able to charge ur phone or listen to music ...can't do two things at a tym12. Support fast charging also works ,heating issues are less13.Enough storage 64gb not expandable .14.no hybrid slot dual nano SIM slot .15. With the smart Lock feature [Face scanner] is fast enoughBut there's is a issue sometime after rebooting the device it goes disable...in that case u (SOLUTION) All u need to do Is go to setting<Security and location< trust agent < smart Lock - turn it on off on and then reboot ✓done .Thank u	4
6947	Awesome camera phone, gorila glass3, glass back design, battery is ok, clean stock Android	5
6948	Not much time since using this but few qualities are -Very Sleek and right sized,  Good Speed,  Good Picture quality. Sound just ok,  Sensors are very good.  Overall Good Value for Money Phone...	4

6961	If 3.5 audio jack is not a problem for you, then you can prefer it.. They'd already provided a dongle for 3.5 audio jack.. You can permanently fix it to your headphones.. the build quality is awesome, even better than realme 2 pro.. I've used realme 2 pro...but the performance is not as good as mi a2.. Camera & sound quality is also good comapre to realme.. Don't worry about the battery performance.. Snapdragon 660 is a very power efficient soc.. I've played 6 pubg matches in HD continuosly, then the battery fall from 100% - 41%%.. It tooks 1hr 10mins approx to charge the battery from 5% - 100%..	4

6977	Using since one month..It is looking like iphone X..	5
6978	For general user who doesnt use much for gaming, this is best in market coming from branded company for great price. It has premium looks and good screen visibility with clear picture quality when viewing high quality videos with bezel less its icing on the cake.Never had lagging till date after using for 1 month and battery is decent.	5
6979	"Hi Friends,It's one moth now I am using this phone initially I was confused that am purchased good phone or not as watched/read some negative reviews on youtube and other sites. But, in real as I am using this phone from last one month I find it awesome. As per my experience below is the review.Pros1) Great look as ppi of this phone is highest in this price segment 441ppi + Gorilla glass 3 give decent look and feel.2) Sturdy : The outer aluminum body maks it really sturdy. In one month it falls 3 times (on cement road, wooden floor and on carpet) from hight of 4 feet but, there is not a single scratch on screen and body also performance of phone remain same!!!!!!Cool😎3) Great performance with Snapdragon 435 processor and 3 GB of ram. I used Lenevo K3 note, MI 3s prime and micromax magnus till date and find this phone as winner in all.4) Even it's the 3000mah battery which provides good backup for 1 and half day on full charge on normal usage and 1 day on heavey usage which decently good. Battery of 3500 or 4000 mah could made this like wow but, still ok with 3000.5) Dedicated memory card slot is added advantage also expandable to 2TB is just unbelievable!!!6) Camera is excellent in daylight with 441 ppi viewing. Not up to the mark when it comes to the low light :(7) Design : Hats off for the disign of this phone. Infinity display, Curved edges, size even it's 5.5"" screen it's one hand use phone make it very rich.8) Face recognition is work good in light but, in low light and in dark need manual intervention.9) DLNI, MHL : I read somewhere these features are in this phone but, still not found. Trying to explore in this area if, anyone came across of these features please provide your valuable information on this.10) No heating issue at all!!!!Cons1) No finger sensor : Now a days phone with price range of 7K also come with finger sensor which is not in this 13 K phone.2) Front camera. This is the improvement area this could be better with this price range.So, overall this is the great, rich, cool phone with well known LG brand which is Indian!!!!!"	4
6980	Nice phoneGood features & lookPicture quality is not as expected	3
6981	Slim and slik. Display is awesome. Front camera is not upto mark but happy with rear one.	4

Can Honor provide its update or we return it ?	3
6994	Picture & battery both are normal	1
6995	I m using this since 5 sep...and i would like to share my opinion about this phone.1. Battery:- Because its stock android battery of 3000mah is also give good backup....almost 6 to 7 hours continuously use...like pubg and youtube2. Performance:- Better than all phones of this range..because its have 660 SD processor.3. Design:- Premium look..its so light weight and thin.. Display is also good.. Brightness level is nice.4. Camera:- this is the best thing of this phone..As you know Mi A series phone is famous for its camera and This phone is fulfilled this quality..Camera is awesome... Portrait mode is too good..low light photography is also better than other phones.	4
6996	REDMI 6 PRO... Started with this basic model mobile.. Almost used ll the brands phones.. But something is special in this Xiaomi.. Awesome mobile with great UI,Camera,Battery... Worth for the budget.... Go for it	4
6997	Camera quality disappointed wrost front camera	3
6998	"Before i planned to buy this phones, i had interest towards Redmi Note5 pro and Nokia 6.1 plus. But thank god i have chosen this now.After 7 days of usage:1. Battery - A minimum one an half day backup.(does not support fast charger so no heating issue, but can easily get 50% charging in 20 to 35 mins can be used for one whole day)2. Camera - Placed the benchmark just awesome3. Performance - Thumbs up to Kirin 710 - Just a rocket speed.4. Looks - A premium look5. Display - Notch makes its more attractive6. Value of money - Yes - DefiantlyOnly Con is ""Phone is slippery better use a good quality back cover"""	5

7039	Back camera is too good	5
7040	First of all, I'm impressed with this phone. The process is cool. Its not lagging; everything is perfectly working fine.The Camera is the only thing I'm not satisfied with. I preferred the front camera to be at least a little bit more clear when shot at low lights. The Back camera is good. Overall my experience in this phone is great except for the camera.One more thing, the phone has two speakers at the bottom. One of them weren't working from the moment I opened the package. Well. didn't make much difference in sound as the single speaker made sufficient sound for me. So I din choose to make a complaint. So that's it. Thanks for reading this far.	4
7041	It's not a good phone because of price is high and it not showing charging indication and SMS , call and mail indication and also heated	3
7042	Battery life is best	5
7043	Purchased this item in first sale after launch, thinking redmi cant fool the customerspros-Display, batteryCons-1.No dual 4G standby ( means  a combination of Jio and airtel/Vodafone cant be used) this is biggest drawback.  even lower variant Redme 6A has this option, i dont know why Mi has not kept this feature in this, its nust requiremrnt now a days, i just purchased it thinking that this option available2.Worst front camera-front cam pics will be crap, even gets worst with low light3.rear camera- not upto the mark, Bokeh mode doesent work properly4.Display broken (may be my negligence), but fallen from just 3-4 feet heightonly, so delicate...???earlier i have used honor phone, once in a train,my honor mobile fallen on to floor from upper berth not even a single hairline crack, sooo solid..OVER ALL- not a good product form Mi or Redmi, i was first time buyer of redmi, it just fooled me...DONT GO FOR IT GUYS	1

7062	Received on 12-10-2018, next day itself slipped from hand due to smooth back cover and edge cracked. Any replacement, if possible. Photos taken are not clear as Moto G3. Upgrading to Android 9.0 required. Other than these minus points, over all good and looks fine.	4
7063	No sd card slot,no facelock,low battery power 3000, low charging process ,not that much good as I compared to opportunity f9pro	1
7064	i did buy this for my mother and she was more than happy when she saw this beautiful piece of cell phone. now its not just the looks but functionality also the camera quality is just superb and the processor is also pretty decent at this price range this is just the best phone you can buy.	5
7065	All excellent	5
7066	Using it for almost 6 months and its working good. I don't compare it with 2019 phone because there is time difference but Picture quality is excellent. Battery life is average. Build quality is also excellent.	5
7067	Product is fine and great, picture quality could have been better. Value for money phone.	5
7068	Nice mobile phoneCamera function verry nice regularly updated available good service by MotoCreen is verry bad and faltu jo turat tut jaati haai	4

7072	Mobile net work on not working, after reboot activate and working	4

7082	Awesome phone, delivered in just 5 days... Stand on expectation...	5
7083	Not good product. In normal use phone heating. Very bad product of lg	1
7084	PROs:1) Phone looks good. Design is kind of premium but not the build. It does not feel full metal, still have a feel of plastic2) Screen is vibrant. Notch is beautiful and the option to hide it is quite handy3) Camera is main focus. I would rate front camera is better than the main camera in this phoneCONs:1) Processor is quite slow. And you feel it as soon as you start using this mobile2) With this price tag, Huawei should have at least provided screen guard and a back cover.	3
7085	Mobile easy to use and sound quality is good.	4
7086	Nice looking. 5 star for the display.User freindly intetface. Camera also morderate quality.battary can be better.	4
7087	Really worth for the priceThe most attracting is its battery life upto 1 and half day with average use..display quality is also a plus point..after mi ui update camera also get improved and feels good .sound quality feels like dolby .totally redmi has completely changed its platform by this one . some demerits also am mentioning take little bit more time to charge than i expect. Can only use one 4g provider at a time. Portrait mode is little disappointing..low light also..dedicated sim slot is a plus point so dont bother about 32 gb. And snapdragon 625 is performing good with 3gb ram.. Overall pretty good in look with notch (1st in mi series).Comparing with the competator nokia 5.1 plus 6 pro is so far better and the most worth phone by its price (11k)	5
7088	Amezing fhone	5
7089	It's sleek and comes handy on one palm. The screen size is large enough to watch videos and movie. The memory size is awesome. The OS has been upgraded to Android 9 Pie without any hastle or charges.Overall, extremely satisfied till date.	5
7090	donot buy	1
7091	Excellent design. Great camera. Lot of options in camera mode. One thing I noticed, no fingerprints attracted on the back glass. Awesome design & Build quality	5

7099	Very good phone, good picture quality great batteryBut it emmits a little extra radiation from time to time that huts the thigh if in the pocket for long time.	4

7103	Been using this phone since one month and the performance is very good recommend to buy this!	5
7104	Display fluctuations some time, low battery... Nice phone. OK to use	5
7105	Overall mobile was amazing but sound is slow and battery drains.	4
7106	it has so advance features but it hasn't video calling feature .that's why i don't like it	4
7107	The product I received was defective. Unfortunately contacted on last day evening, hoping to get replacement but I was not allowed for no reasons. I called at customer care 3 times but couldn't get the resolution. Very sad. Pity on Amazon. This is not the correct way.	2
7108	Some basic features like Screenshot, Call recording, Voice recording,Compass, Weather, Radio etc are missing for a phone which is so highly priced. Battery discharges pretty quickly, wired earphones will need an additional appendage to connect with the phone (although it comes  with the package, but if you loose it connecting an earphone will become a problem) and lastly I am not able to use my old android chargers as this one has a different slot. This is only good for people who love to take selfies.	1
7109	More than better expectation	4

7118	Only purchased this for the stock Android experience and I'm not disappointed so far. The battery life is really not that good and could've been improved but what more can you ask for a phone this cheap.Bought it effectively at a price of 12.5k only and this phone really is worth every penny. The camera is good, screen is bright enough, build quality is also solid and overall it's a competitive device in this price segment!So if you're looking for a phone that gets you the latest updates and comes with a good camera, then this should be in your wish list!	4
7119	Front camera is ok back camera is good..battery is one day performer sound is ok	4
7120	Picture quality is not such good	4

7129	"I bought this mobile from Amazon, Thanks for providing a such good service. This mobile looking is awesome, Design, looking, features, body built etc are + points. But, Camera performance is not good, when i am trying to take continuous shots, it will stuck and i am receiving a msg "" restart your mobile"" , okay, i did, then in my second trail i am getting same error. How many times i have to restart my mobile. Battery : They have given full day... but, it is consuming 6% of battery per 1 hr, so, max in 16 hrs battery will dry with minimal usage not frequent or even gaming or chating. Pictures are taking much time to restore image. Face unlock option is not working in  my mobile. Any way i have given 3.2 rating with my experience."	4
7130	Front camera very bad , rear camera is average ... Battery life is good but at this price point this is a bad option	3

7180	Love the phone	5
7181	My phone is just 2and half months old. I bought it on 22August 2018. It started showing problems from the end of September, like the backlight flickers and the phone needs to be restarted sometimes because it doesn't catch network even on main road. And my headphones are already dead on one side.So, all in all, good phone but bad condition.	3
7182	This phone is totallly awesome man. Its camera , battery ,processor just tooo goood...  I love it	4
7183	Phone is not that fast as expected. It hangs. M writing this reveiw after 25 days of use. Takes time to open applications. Camera is okay. I got this phone for 7,100.. With exchange + cashback+ lighting deal. According to me phone is worth of buying for 8500/-..	3
7184	The only reason to buy this mobile was supposedly long battery life but it turned out to be biggest issue. Even without hitting the optimal use (barely 30 mins of making and receiving calls and no other use like playing music, browsing net, sms, whatsapp or any other possible activity), it's battery gets discharged in less than a day, that too within 15 days of buying it...My old samsung note 3 mobile was giving me similar kind of troubles after using it for 5 years so I thought of buying a cheap mobile but it turned out to be really CHEAP....now i see no return option amazon for this order....please suggest how to return it or I have to literally hand it over to some recycling center....	1
7185	Nice service must appreciate...Nice mobile...50000 rs mobile feeling.... Just heating effect...Is a drawback otherwise best phone...	5

7192	Good product with old SOC and higher price.. And Camera is good.	4
7193	Camera quality is very bad compared with Mi A1.Potrait mod is worst.	1
7194	The mobile heating a lot near volume rocker  button. Also got the back scratched product. Sound quality is not sufficient to watch a movie. Hand feel good. screen quality OK but you get this display quality on any samsung HD display. touch is smooth and responsive. battery lasts 6-7 hours on internet usage or gaming. It takes around 3 hours to full charge.Face detection is not accurate, Some times it unlocks sometimes not. Front camera is pathetic, say it VGA. Rear camera is OK but focussing is not good.	2
7195	Nice phone,It is a mid range nice phone.	5
7196	Battery is good not batter,but picture quality is down and sound is good	4

7208	"It is good look and very slim, but the battery backup is very poor also it is over heating while playing games like temple run and subway surfers. Whilst checking with ""SmartChk"" app, the temperature was 50*C, am waiting for replacement now."	2
7209	Picture quality is poor. Sound quality is good and battery life proformance very good	1
7210	Very good camera performance. I m very much satisfied with the camera. But apart from camera nothing is much better in this phone. Price range is too high of this device. In this price range you'll get much better options...	3

7245	This is one of the best handset i ever have and the deal offerd was also lucrative. So i have no reason to refuse LG as brand name is assurance for the quality	3
7246	I have been using Redmi since 3 years now starting with MI 2, NOTE 3/4, REDMI 4 AND now this Redmi 6 pro. The latest has turned out to be the worst of them all. The screen size as claimed by Redmi is full screen but the functionality while playing the video is absolutely poor. While watching the video most the screen gets cut leaving the video display absolutely disgraceful. The sound quality is the poorest of all the Redmi models with only one speaker functional. When I asked Redmi tevhnical staff to exchange the phone, they are asking to get a report from MI service centre which I have never heard of. Talking to Amazon customer care is an absolute disgrace. The technical support of amazon needs a technical support themselves  to improve the sound quality and signal strength of there call centre. One cannot hear until they insert the phone in the ear. Not at all helpful. If I have been given a time to replace or return my order then why I am being asked to get a report from service centre. MY JOURNEY WITH MI PHONES ENDS HERE IF I AM NOT PROVIDED WITH A PERMANENT SOLUTION.	1
7247	Go for note series	1
7248	the most Important thing to note that Honor has done a spectacular job in the design area for this device...its not too heavy or big or anything...the notch is lovely ❤️display quality is excellent though one can tweek it as they want...cameras are great aspect of this device (though i saw in some of the reviews that people were complaining about it) well if one know how to go around with snaps and imagegraphy they can produce some beautiful shots ❤️gaming is also priority for some peoples so don't worry much this can easily handle PUBG or Asphalt 9 easily...you won't notice any heating or lagging while playing the aforementioned games !battery life was a thing for which i was afraid of but it didn't disappointed me any point...the stats were always good and showed that Kirin 710 is actually a great chipset choice ⭐one more thing in the price point they have done a spectacular job ⭐	5
7249	It's a good product after use of 1 week its somewhat heating while using continuously.. Anybody please tell how can i awail the free screen brake service	4
7250	UG- 23 vishvasadan building, Janakpuri District Center, New Delhi, Delhi 110058 this is a fraud service center running in Delhi Please do not go there  even google is Showing it on number 1 Position they lost my phone and mention i already taken that one going to put FIR on the same as well on Google that let go there	1
7251	Not a bed device and not up to the mark, front camera is not clicking the good photos, back camera is good, battery is not up to the mark, promaxity senser is not working good	3
7252	good midrenge phone	5
7253	On time delivery & a great exchange deal! Thanks Amazon.Phone Is very decent at this price point. No over heating and no battery drain, have been using it extensively since couple of days.Looks premium and LG build should ensure it outlasts the so called feature rich Chinese models.And the feeling of using a Made In India product--- Priceless!!!	5
7254	When i play any of audio, voice is breaking. Even when i call, voice is not clear. With this problem phone is not usable and worth for money	2
7255	Awesome camera	5

7258	Best phone ..!!	4
7259	I received this phone in well packed condition.5/5Front camera not as clear as it should be in 5 mega pixel. 3/5Battery condition is good. You can use upto 9 hours continuesly. 4/5I have not faced heating issue yet. So can not say. If you will use any phone continue for hours it will get heated so it is genuine.Overall it is a very good phone.	4
7260	Over all is good ...bur improve battery quality	4
7261	Disappointed	1
7262	Excellent Mobile from MI at the best price one can afford for. Best picture quality and display as well as sound quality at its best in this phone.	5
7263	Cool gadget to buy. But sd625 chipset is older. Must b better next time	4
7264	Awesome product all the wayREAD MORE	5
7265	Just the second day of use so can have these observations.... Delivery by the seller was same day within 5hrs of order👍superb	4
7266	Phone is nice bt battery is so worse.	4
7267	Pretty bad on Xiaomi and Amazon that they are promoting very cheap quality phone. My phone is heating from 30°C to 42°C. Even though there is a variance of 12°C Amazon, Tech executive are saying it is working fine. Ears are burning while taking. Amazon is not helping to return the phone. Xiaomi is looting money with very cheap quality phones.  People should avoid these kind of phones. A big NO.	1
7268	I am writing this review after useing this phone for more than two months. Excellent battery Life, reasonably good camera and picture quality, very good built quality. Screen size is also adequate to view videos and movies. Your can't get a full screen notch phone in this price range, total value for money product.	5
7269	Awesome Phone in the given range	5
7270	Very good display ,this give me full vision  with the good camera .elegant look and i just love the colour.	5
7271	Pathetic sound quality and phone speed . buy it @8k with exchange but not worth more than 7k.Pleaseee don't buy it.	1
7272	The only issue is with the speaker. Within 4 months of its purchase, the only speaker has started misbehaving for the second time. I got it repaired and now again it has reached the same stage. Nokia needs to develop/reopen its service centers back.	3
7273	Do not buy this phone...processor does not justify the pricing of the phone...also exchange value for this phone when u try to exchange it is miserable..having bought this phone from Amazon, never expected this kind of resale value on a brand new phone...	1
7274	Good front cam, battery, call quality are plusNo expandable memory, unable to use earphone are minus	4
7275	Best in the segment	5
7276	Camera is not good.	3
7277	Phone  performance is  good but it is delivered with damaged display	4
7278	Everything is amazing onething only one thing less hybrid slot	5
7279	This phone looks very nice and very smooth touch ... but the type of design phone that has the back side of the phone is not available...😏😏😏	4
7280	Have been using Q6 for more than 4 months now1 thing the phone heats up at times .LG is consistently providing updates but hasnt given the oreo update.Over all performance of the phone is good.Not a gamers phone though it supports high graphic games.Found it to be costly at the price 13990 as there are cheaper options with more features	4
7281	The screen is nice the quality of the handset is great and feel is mid premium battery life could be improved hopefully it n he next update it will be done	4
7282	Very good product but Barry low it's not big problems	5
7283	As with any android phone, the camera is a let down. Otherwise, Nokia lives up to its days of glory.	4
7284	I am hearing my own voice while talking over this phone. Bad quality mic	3
7285	Due to low battery endurance this phone fails and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Lots of other good option available on Flipkart.	1
7286	Battery backup is poor	4
7287	During call ear speaker ringer some time getting irritation.. if ringer volume set 60% to 70 % that time also ringer occurred irritation.	3
7288	Worst product in the world	1
7289	Worst thing is back of the phone is made of glass which breaks with just one drop? What the hell amazon sold me as amazon choice.Never to buy on amazon again.Other Worst thing is that since lenovo is chinese company .Moto quality is same as other china phones. One of the worst thing is  battery life , since they give you turbo charger , they expect the phone to be always plugged in or every 2-3 hour atleast. Picture quality of mi3 or mi4 is better than motog6. My rating is -5 for this phone. Never believe in big indian sale drama , they sell u worst items with inflated price as sale offer price	1

7302	Superb phone,,display quality is very good,also battery life is really appreciated,,it's a really value for money product....	4
7303	Beauty in hand.Little hitting issue.Great different look in such exchange price.	4
7304	Ordered the product on 10th August and got it delivered on 11th. Have been using the phone for the past 4 days and here is the review:1. The screen is and looks of the phone are great2. Android comes with the least customization and minimum bloatware3. Phone appears and feels sturdy with the aluminium frame around4. Made in IndiaHere ends the good part. Now coming to the bad things:1. Phone heats up beyond 40 degrees when downloading / syncing data and during automatic updates and it becomes difficult to hold the phone at such times as the aluminium frame gets heated2. Full charge from under 15% takes around 3 hours, which is somehow ok3. With auto-sync on, the phone does not last longer than 10 hours of moderate useNow coming to the return / refund policy of Amazon:1. Tried calling Amazon for a replacement or return.2. I was asked to download the Smart Check App and the device was remotely monitored3. The Smart Check App has a tolerance limit of 48 degrees and only if the temperature is crossing 48 degrees, the phone can be replaced and this Amazon says is as per the manufacturer's policy. Effectively, what they say is unless your hands are burning because of the heat, the phone will not be replaced.4. The battery backup they say is as per expectations because apps are running in the background and they cannot do anything about it.5. All they said they could do was to send a technician to check the phone	1

7315	Build quality is very good and also battery life picture quality... Am given 5 stars to this product	5
7316	Iam purchased this mobile on 08-09-2017 from Amazon --- This is the wonderful display i never seen  in this price range in the market, and call quality is better than other brands -- but, ear phones not satisfy to me -- actually iam confused which mobile brand i will purchased  sony -or LG but, iam going to purchase this LG Q6  -- After that i will satisfy my decision with this mobile -- another point  why iam purchase to this lg q6 -- recently 6 monts back iam purchased sony xperial xa mobiles -- 10 days back screen is not working properly and i will go to sony centre and replaced the screen -- therefore i will full satisfy to purchase this mobile --- dear friends you look the mobiles below 15000 k - this is the best option to purchase this mobile -- i will reming the all friends -- this mobile screen is most wonderful -- wonderful & wonderful	5
7317	Products are good at this cost in comparison to others but Mi Service centers are costing much higher amount for repairing damaged products.	4
7318	Very Good looks and display. Handy also.	5
7319	The best phone in the market at this price  nice phone good battery life and nice front camera	5
7320	We bought this phone for my wife. The phone is gorgeous and works well otherwise, but its radio is not very strong for the weak Airtel network that is horrible in Mumbai. We found that many times the person at the other end cannot hear us. Not a problem with my Moto G phone on the same cellular network. Also, when my Moto G shows 4G or H (3G), the LG just shows E (edge) for data. When we switched to Vodafone, the phone started working very well. So, taking one star off because of a weak radio. Caution: Other non-Motorola phones have the same problem with weak networks such as Airtel in Mumbai.	4
7321	Goodness smooth Really it’s so easyAnd is useful in super fast is more and more and more secure with Best Sound quality	4
7322	Overall phone is good but to my surprise it doesn't support direct video calls through jio volte, music quality through ear phone is also average.	4

7334	Please send invoice with seller details, as warranty card is not filled. It will be helpful in case for claiming for warranty	5
7335	Product built quality and looks is awesome i would rate 5 out of 5. But for bettery backup is not up to the mark. Taking two hour for charging and take 3 to 4 hour to drain if you use phone continuously . For front camera I would rate 5 out of 5.UI is also slow if you are using many apps in the phone.	3
7336	Wow Deign  and  good phone	4
7337	Would give it 5 stars as recd earphone not in working condition. If replaced then its 5/5 stars. very easy to use interface as simple as it can get. feel and hold too is awesome.100% would recommend to own one	4

7349	"Got it for 15.5k from Amazon. Camera is great except colors are too deep, giving an artificial feel. Display is NARROW compared to normal 5.5 "" screens. Backside is extremely slippery, it even glides at times when kept on cloth, so back cover is a must. Weight is less, looks premium and can be a good purchase if bought for a good price.Portrait mode of front cam doesn't work"	4
7350	Feel premium.. looks osm in red... Network strength much better than other smartphone up to 25k	4

7355	This mobile is not quality	1
7356	Loved this phone.  First of all the premium display in this price range is very rare.  Loved the glass back dual tone color. Photos  from both camera is very good quality.  The AI mode is just fabulous.  I will recommend  it to everyone.  Best phone in this price range.	5
7357	While experience was a disaster from the time I ordered till now. Ordered this on 16-Jul, conned by Amazon's prime offer of price and delivery. They rightly promised delivery the next day. Whole day on 17th, they even bombarded me with messages and emails that your product is out for delivery and will be delivered by 9:30pm. But guess what, nothing delivered and no communication from amazon, why! On whole day 18th, same story continued....as usual nothing was delivered. In these two days I had called and complained several times, but amazon has turned itself into an organization with red tape at every corner. Finally on 19th they delivered it. But another guess...phone was not working. I complained the same day and just found that their return policy is full of whole can of worms. I had to install a stupid app which told me what I already could see and know that signals on phone are there!!!! Then as I had made a mistake by ordering the phone from amazon, I myself had to ask for technician visit who will come in his own leisurely time, do his analysis, file a report with his conclusion. I being a culprit again for shopping with them, have to request for replacement, which will take another 2-3 days to deliver! They will simply not take the product back.I had bought this with an exchange offer of an already working but old phone. Now left with nothing but wait for amazon's process cycle to work at its snail pace!My advice...only buy from amazon if you have patience to go through all this and a customer service who have no authorization to do anything else except tell you the process....or buy elsewhere.Regarding the phone, it looks stunning for the price, though a bit slippery due to glass back...will post detailed feedback once its working and usable.	1

7407	"At the price I got it for, I'd say it's a fantastic phone. To put it into perspective, my daily driver is/was a One+ 3T, also purchased from Amazon. This phone does not perform to the same level - and understandably so, but the overall phone experience is comparable and sometimes tilts in favour of the LG.For a lot of people, a phone is the only computing device at hand, so maybe the review is not relevant for them. I personally use a phone as a a phone, with the occasional glance at gmail or a website or two.The default display colour is very cool, probably due to the quality of the LEDs - a common problem I see in most Indian-made/calibrated products nowadays. Even though the display is large and has higher pixel density than 5.5"" FHD phones, somehow the final look is not too great. There is still too much artificial sharpening/halo around text, and the blue colour makes it look terrible. There is a blue light filter to help with that, but even at lowest setting turns it a shade of brown, but it's more bearable than the default. sRGB mode in developer options does not work, meaning the display cannot be tweaked beyond some basic look.  Half a star off for that - they tout the display as their best feature, but it's really not. I would consider an anti-glare screen protector essential for this display.The software interface would have been great were it not for the lack of an app drawer, which is a really bad move by phone makers. A sorted app drawer helps in keeping clean homescreens - LG uses folders to stack and organise apps, but their labelling is confusing and finding an app may take a bit of time. Half a star off for that as well - though I would put it at or slightly above the level of OxygenOS were it not for that omission. I had to install a launcher separately, which I never enjoy doing due to the loss of optimisation.I have not had any overheating problems faced by other reviewers, so I'm guessing it's a consistency issue. My 3T runs as warm as this phone, also on the left near the volume rocker. What makes it worse on the LG is there's a small bit of metal between the two buttons which makes it feel a bit warmer. I added a back cover and this eliminated that issue completely - though I can't say it was disturbing me at all.The relatively weaker processor does not bother me too much. Interface seems smooth enough, though I do see some lag on very heavy websites such as Wired. Not a deal-breaker, but it is there. The additional pixels do not help the cause of the GPU, so there is a potential issue with those who like to push their unit harder.The call quality is absolutely stellar, and well above what I get from the other phone. voices sound clear and full-bodied, a very welcome change from the tinny Chinese earpieces populating the Redmi I had earlier, and the One+ as well. The theme of great sound is carried over to the headphone output, which sounds superb with good detail and definition. It's a welcome change form the 3T, which sounds like a meat grinder by comparison. The LGs loudspeaker lets it down, it's tinny and easily covered, and absolutely useless when the phone is kept face up.I have yet to run battery life tests but am not confident that it will break any records. More pixels and a slower processor/GPU means it will be less efficient than what I've used before. The processors will be running harder more of the time and the display will compound the issue.Overall though, I'd say it's a much better product than I expected it to be, quite the surprise at what I consider to be a reasonable price after exchanges and cashbacks. At its original launch price it would have been a tougher sell though."	4

Both daylight and night.Touch quality is great.Sound quality is great.No lags yet even after 7 days of playing PUB-G. No much heating.The best things I liked is the size of the device.

7479	Hi vewersI am not going complain more about phone.The only with the display features. There are host of display features in. But it doesn't give natural colors that is some what over saturated.And the main thing is when you are in auto brightness mode you can't able to set the minimum brightness level. Which may be the software bug.What I am saying to huawei or honor to fix this problem as soon as possible with the next update.One thing don't under estimate this phone the build and performance beast at this price level. BLINDLY GO FOR IT.	4
7480	Awasome phone in this range	5

7496	"Only one good thing in this phone is touch. 5/5.Battery is very poor. With 4g data ON only half day on WIFI more than half day. With out internet approximately 1 day.Rear camera n front camera is worst. Looks like VGA camera.Highly not prefered for gaming. If u started gaming then battery will get drained in hours.Phone doesnt look like 5.5""inch. U feel like its 5.I feel 15000/ is non worthy for this phone.Moreever people who use roughly should not prefer.Phone will starts getting heated when u try to download the two apps on wifi. One strange thing is heating starts from volume buttons.If u need to charge it from. 10%  to 100% needs 2hrs 45 mins.Kind information guys. After reading this still wanted to buy. One more issue is amazon will never refund or return ur money on this mobile.My kind request is please do not buy this mobile. U can go for motog5s plus of the same cost with high end features."	1
7497	No issues after one month of use, battery is working fine after the update, it would have been best in the range if it had FP sensor. The front camera is not good but it is ok, however rear camera is great.	5
7498	Very nice product from Samsung. I was using Grand 2 before & Samsung built quality perfect with excellent performance. Thank you amazon with gr8 delivery.	5
7499	It's a good phone under this budget with good performance and it might not be proven a gaming phone for you	5
7500	Good Picture quality and superb camera. High resolution videos supported. Better price range i m purchased time 14000...4.5 star rated	4
7501	Product is good with better picture quality. But the sound quality is not up to the mark as it is breaking while receiving the call from other phones. I have been observing this since delivery. So can you resolve this issue or replace it with another piece.	4
7502	Over all fabulous phone	5
7503	Best mobile that I had ever use.But I am little disappointed with my camera's video stabilisation but all are good.I just want a major update for camera quality.	5
7504	The phone is very good and the quality is good	4
7505	It's a good phone for the entry level. The quality is up to the mark and very steardy for a bit rough use. Bought it for my 14yr old nephew who absolutely loves it	5
7506	Great buy and value for money	5
7507	Great phone with MILATARY STANDARDS.	5
7508	Best gadget of mi,camera clarity very nice, slim mobile, but we cant expect battery backup becoz thy gvn less than 4000mAh	5
7509	I'm not Happy this kind of cell phone	1
7510	Good phone but price should be under 11000	5
7511	Good product but not worth of 15k.Its worth around 11 to 12k.No finger print scanner. Back body is of plastic.	3
7512	I have run this phone for 1 month, its camera is good, battery backup is not good and its charger has also got spoiled.	4
7513	Veryyy nice phone	5
7514	Camera is poor, remaining are the best	4
7515	Mobile is not good. Xiaomi is not in the race while comparing its camera. Vivo and oppo has gone miles ahead.	4
7516	Decent phone.The display is just amazing. You cant unlove it.Touch response is the best I've experienced so far.Theatest android is amazing.Cons -speaker quality. (Manageable at this cost)Processor (clearly not gor gaming) but medium end games run decently Camera quality is average. Front camera is a joke bit manageable.Face id works decently.No fingerprint scanner.But I'm quite satisfied with the product. I loved it. The pros are really good. The scree. Is amazing. Face id works fineBattery is also decent enough vut takes a lot of time to charge.Made in India, a bugable prodict if not a gamer and photographic freak. Else an easy miss.  But the phone is a really good cheap version of lg g6	5
7517	Im a big fan of honor. All futures of honor 8x are awesome. Battery lasts almost 1.5 day for me with more then moderate use. Sound quality is nice, no scratching sounds found. Completly value for money. Best option below 15k...	5
7518	Cool gadget	5
7519	This phone in its range is the best, I've been using this phone for a month now and I must says that my  experience has been good.. Display of this device stands out, as its 18:9 one of its kind.. Battery life.. I would say average as it last for a day with the mixed usage. Looks porch and its not heavy.. Overall a good device.. Worth every penny...	5
7520	UI is amazing along with great battery backup and amazing camera... One shuld prefer ths over Oppo Vivo n Redmi	5
7521	Good camera, display & sound.	5

7523	"First of all friends have best wishes for purchasing a fantastic phone by LG. Now come on its advantage and dis-advantage of buying.First of all deep heartily thanks to Amazon for its fast delivery and very positive responsive customer service.Pros-1) Display- friends display quality is awesome of this mobile as LG giving a fullvision display(16:9) with a full hd resolution of 1080×2160 with 442 PPI. Touch response also so good as it's like ""malaai maar ke"" feeling.2) Surfing speed- Surfing and downloading speed is really good and it's already described that it has a fast fast downloader.3) Camera-Back/Rear camera is really up to the mark I want to give 9/10 but front cam quality could have better. It's not so bad but just satisfactory as it's price point.4) Face recognition- Really impressed me. I just loved it's specification of face smile unlocking.5) Battery- battery performance is also good as it  has 3000 mah battery so it's not good as 4000 mah but it's back up is a full day for medium user like me.6) Screen replacement guarantee- dear all as we now in these days screen breaking is most common issue as LG giving 6 month for one time replacement of mobile screen in Q6. So it is also an advantage of this phone.As it has more other specification like latest android version 7.1.1 and also comfort view to keeping safe your eyes while reading and long Surfing on mobile, OTG support,light weight, slim design(looks and feeling like holding iphone-7).Cons-1) Heating- heating while using in multi-tasking like Wi-Fi, hotspot, 4g internet surfing. You can't use it for more works together as it's heating problem.2) Front cam- as mentioned above that front cam quality should have been better but in this price we can't expect more.LG is really giving a good phone in this price everyone can go for it if it suits your budget. All colours are good go as per your choice.Exchange offer +1500 also a good advantage friends. Thanks amazon again for your good service. Don't feel shy in heating like button if you liked my review friends. 😊"	4

7541	"Best smart phone under 15K. Design is better than other leading brands, can able to handle mobile in one hand even it's having 5.5"" screen. Display is awesome and colors are rendering nicely. Most peoples are reporting heating issue, actually mobile is warming up a bit on initial use. LG has already gave 2 new updates so far, after installing no more heating issue observed. Some of them mentioning heat is pretty much high near volume keys, that's because the device consists of metal frame and fiber plastic on back, thus heat get decimated there and it can be felt near the corners. Screen cast/mirroring is not available. Using this mobile for a week, performance is really good, smooth and user friendly UI. Battery backup is descent, slim body. Audio output is very good. In a nutshell, LG Q6 is a great piece of mobile device. Thank you LG for providing such a wonderful product on budget price."	5
7542	Really good phone. But sometimes it's getting laggy. After Android Pie update the phone became smoother. Camera quality is very good. Only one con which I have is only about it's output through headphones. Earlier it was not clear output because every time I had to replug the earphones for better clarity. But after Android Pie update the loudness reduced and output became more terrible. Otherwise it's a good phone. I loved it. My previous phone was mi a1. That's why I'm focusing on the output through headphones.	4
7543	Nice phone every thing is fine turn on data saver for arrest background apps. I appreciate LG for this product. Please provide backcover from LG. and one most important point is heating issue. Please update to reduce heating	4
7544	Worst and waste of money	1
7545	Dear viewers,I bought this product 15days back.Gradually by updates I am getting many problems.I have been used previously Motorola and Samsung.But I didn't get any problems.But now Nokia is not perfect as before.	1
7546	I'm posting this review after almost two months usage. Apart from screen ratio there is nothing to mention about this phone. Too much heating problem. Sometimes it feels like exploding. I don't understand why this is generating too much heat for normal usage. I use only social media and regular calls, don't play any games and If you want good camera mobile then you must not go for this mobile. My three years old one plus one has far better quality camera than this. Sound quality also not good. I'm struggling with this phone, can't use this phone anymore due severe heat problem. Now in this price range there are other good options. Chose wisely!!!	1
7547	Design is good. But facing issue while connecting to WIFI and apps are not downloading from Play store. Think before you go for this phone.	1
7548	Don't like the Mi apps all over the place, and sim+memory slot access is unnecessarily complicated requiring a pin to open it.	3
7549	Awesome product. Premium and stylish look. Great product in this price range.performance is very good. Must go for it. Glass body.	5
7550	I god bad product ☹️☹️☹️	1
7551	Good Phone for normal uses.	4
7552	The camera is awesome.Sound quality is good but needed a separate 3.5mm audio jack connection. Audio connector is available in the box which is a little bit annoying. If the connector is misplaced you will have to buy another one.The battery will not last long if you play heavy games like PubG or other.	4
7553	It's a great phone with excellent battery	5
7554	Worst product total waste of mony	1
7555	Nice handset, but heating issue persist which was not observed in redmi note 4	5
7556	Front camera not bokeh effect, it's slow 450sd at this price range, dual sim volte not supported	4
7557	Nice product what I wantI m happy wd ..Awesome to use.. nice speedI suggest to buy this mobile	4
7558	I am using the phone for last 3 months, and it is a great phone. Also the Android 9 update came by early December. So it's  great device from Xiaomi.  The camera, both the front and back are awesome. The image quality and speed of the phone is really good. The fingerprint sensor is fast, however there is some issue in face lock feature. Some time it will work, some time it wont work. May be there are some bugs for, so it behaves in this way. The biggest con is the battery. If it was around 4000mah, then it would have been an unbeaten phone in this category. In moderate use, it will last for the whole day. But heavy usage might last for 8-9 hours maximum. So I found only thses 2 cons after 2 months of heavy usage. Other than that, it is nice one in this budget to go.	4
7559	Moto G6 is best in this pri e range. Good camera nice looking. But unfortunately I got defective piece and after that Amazon irritated me alot. I fed up to return the product and also for the refund. Then I cancel the idea to buy from Amazon. And I buy Moto G6 from the other source. Phone is amazing...	4

7582	I got this phone on in 1 day and when I opened the box, I was thinking that device is so small. However, 18:9 FullVision Display is there, since the manufacturer has kept the boundary of the phone very thin. That is why it's looking small but very nice phone and good deal. Display unparellel to Iphone and is really giving it extra look. All other features good,,,if you are budget conscious and can't afford iphone 6,,then go for it,,,dont go through negative reviews,,,it is good looking phone also camera is nice and performance is superb,,,I like it and also suggest to go for it.	4

7619	Good phone and got it at a good cost. A colleague of mine purchased it from my account	5
7620	The graphic quality differs a lot from other phones but what can we expect more from 15k battery 🔋 not so lasting with 4g. Gaming pubg last only for 3 _ 4 hours	4
7621	Battery life is not good	4
7622	Phone heat when internet data on & mobile game running.pls replaced phone and call me urgent	1
7623	Awesome phone 📱	4

7626	Facing problem using keypad. Sometimes backspace doest not move and work while typing . If i want to give space after typing word its doest not move and remain there.	3
7627	Mobile is good but battery backup not good	4
7628	worst mobile	1
7629	Good PRODUCT	5
7630	Pathetic quality. Fast battery drain and heating issue.	1
7631	Opening Phone book with background of Whatsapp & few other apps is getting hang. Phone book is basic application and where we are feeling very frustrating when phone book gets hangs. Battery is draining very fast.	1
7632	Very nice picture quality good sound but battery little bit small	5

7635	Owesome phone....Sirra	5
7636	I am purchased this mobile on 22oct iam very happy  very nice mobile	5
7637	After using 2 week phone pictures and sound quality is good battery life is ok	4
7638	Awsome Phone	5
7639	Pros:1. Smooth experience to use.2. UI is great, comes with many useful feature3. System and ram management is awesome...4. Camera is ok but nor great, i feel AI management is not that much good... Without steady hand picture quality is bad... I like it's low light pictures.5. Design is awesome as well as the display.Cons: 1. You don't like the performance if you are a gamer. It heats more than expected. I am a fan of marvel contest of champions and while playing cpu soc temperature goes to 46 degree C. Which i don't like. And also Games lags while charging phone.2. Battery life is fine if you are using without playing much games. Quick charging is good. You can charge 100% in 1.5 hour.Overall no sense of purchasing this phone, MI A2 and honor play is far better than this phone in this range.	3
7640	Thanks Amazon for fast delivery...No issue facing ......product is awesome........go for it ..... 1.Camera is good (4.1* )2.Battery is good(4.6*)3.Build Quality(5*)4.Amazing OS(EMUI)BUT Honor does not gives regular google security patches,that's only the downside5.Display(5*)6.Notch simply perfect(5*)7.Kirin 710(awosome) (4*)But little bit lagy while gaming comparing to 660SD	5

7654	i like this handset	5
7655	Awesome, no any other word can describe this device. After using few days I am posting this review. Will try to cover almost all expect.1. Batter - I don't have more than 5 stars otherwise given to it. Wathched movies, heavy internet usage, app running in background, play couple of games and still battery lasts 2 and half day. Just WOW.2. Design - You can't get anything beautiful than this at any price. Looks premium, metal body, glass at backside-back cover suggested, easy to handle, perfect size, physical buttons are at perfect reach.3. Display - stunning vibrant display, vibrant color in sun, comes with pre- applied screen protector.4. Camera - 20MP + 2MP dual back camera. It capture stunning images and videos. I tried so.e food photography, nature photos, traffic, night and some aerial shots, all are gives good color output. It has 16MP front camera which is for selfie centric people and they would love to have one.5. Security - Honor 8X comes with huawei security feature like fingerprint and face recognition feature. Fingerprint and face recognition is really fast.6. Performance - This device comes with Hisilicon Kirin 710, which can match up with SD 710. It made of four cortex A73 cores clocking at 2.2GHz and four cortex A53 cores at 1.7GHz. I did not found any lags while aying Pubg, Asphalt 9 Legends.Overall Great device at this price. It is a jackpot for under 15k.#ReviewHonor8X	5

7671	Bought it from a shop, been using it for 3 weeks now.I would say not entirely disappointed with it. Design is pretty good, camera isn't bad, has good sound output.. But the charger stopped working in 2 days, And got it replaced in a short time..good for day to day tasks, not so great for gamers.	5

7680	A very handsome and sleek set.	5
7681	Rear camera no good quality & no 4 k recording& not gaming mobile	3
7682	Very pathetic battery life. Hardly runs for 12 hrs with moderate usage.On top of that this phone has super efficient memory management it doesn't even keep an app in background for even 1 second .like you switch between apps and you lost the state in old app , and have to start from all over again.With such super efficient battery management it should have be giving more battery backup but it looks like to be working against it.	3
7683	Awsome phone for a moderate user.	5
7684	Over all good if you want under 11k various feature then i suggest this one of the best redmi 6 pro	4
7685	A very gorgeous phone,with good performance.Camera quality is good,AI camera does its job perfectly and enhances picture quality.sound quality is fine like any other Honor phone,varies with the audio file's quality.Display is mesmerizing,crisp,and ohone management is up to the mark.Kirin processor enhances the performance as well as battery usage,so battery lasts easily for a day and a half when used normally.Go for it,highly recommended.	5
7686	Everything is good but delivery was too late	5

7693	Beautiful to look at. But not a perfect device. Screen has latency issues and the battery life is average. Camera leaves alot to be desired and front cam is wide but quality is poor. Better go for nokia6	3
7694	Apparently the product seems good however, the 3.5 mm jack is too loose to support the earphones and disconnects time and again. Your help regarding this is expected.	3

7722	Good phone for the price range	5
7723	Camera is best, good look, battery is average, sound is a bit low compared to other mi phone (Note series), i think MIUI is better than android one.+point: Look, build quality, camera, selfie light is added advantage.also we can create many user accounts like in windows PC, switching from one account to another is very  easy and fast.	4

7784	#Very good camera. The manual mode is superb!#Battery drains a bit fast, still could use for a day. For moderate uses it can stand for over a day.#type c to 3.5 mm port is very useful and thankful that it is provided alongside. Hoping that companies make headphones with type c jack, if it's possible.#the company logo on the back is not very visible (in the black variant), it doesn't bother me much, just saying. 😁#no SD card slot! But has about 46gb usable internal memory!#adaptive brightness is not very fast, but tolerable.#no notch. But I feel it's better without the notch.#thin and light. Looks premium.#certain software issues are being solved over time with frequent updates from Google.Overall a great phone with light draw backs.There are better gaming phones in the under 20k category. This is an awesome phone (with stock Android) in just 17k, for day to day works.	4
7785	Nice picture quality, sound and battery charge full day standard	5
7786	my mobile is less than a month old but Frequently plain black screen is showing its a hug bug/ manufacturing defect. Dont buy this model. Im getting doubt weather it is original or duplicate. and one more thing dont sign up the pre installed fitness app it ll show advertisement each and every time while you unlock your mobile.	1
7787	Cam is not as expected especially in dim light	4
7788	Very bad and i say worst qualityThis phone hangs many times and automatic calls are done and display is working automatically without typing its horrible i am fed up of this phone	1
7789	This mobile phone is the pioneer of low budget best camera phones there are, and realising the fact that this is made by xiaomi, the phone quality is just amazing, I no longer download HD wallpapers to be set on my phone, I just use the high quality snaps captured by mi A2.The sound of the speaker's are loud enough and I can hear my phone ringing from 2 rooms away. Not to forget, the phone recently got a stable android pie update which is pretty amazing as well.I am disappointed by the battery life of the phone though, I have to charge it twice a day for a decent usage....The fast charging feature through type-C port, however makes it easier to charge it quick.Also if you are buying this phone, do by mi quick charger 3.0 separately else the charging though standard charger is not as good as it is supposed to be	4
7790	last 3years i used lg Nexus 5. This is my first nokia smart phone. Before I can't expect this build quality, camera, display and sound. sony and lg phone lovers are just try this don't hesitate. Just one word i say AwesomeREAD MORE	5

7796	Combination of 4GB, 64GB and 2.0Ghz.....It is good. Size is also good as i looking for.	5
7797	LG Q6 is an amazing product, fits the bill very well. Looks fantastic with 18:9 display, when held in hand it gives a nice authentic feeling. It's got smooth performance until now, no issues. Battery lasts good enough for a day, camera is fine too for the price. Definitely a product worth trying!!	5
7798	All r good	4
7799	I should have gone for the black model. The red is way too red for my liking.	4
7800	This phone display is really fantastic, as far as the performance is concerned it is average in specs and the camera quality is pathetic, even a Rs.6000 products available are good camera sets. Here I would like to request LG to please improve the camera quality of this device providing a FOTA update software and then this device will going to be a top notch for its price point.	4
7801	Good. Mobile camera clarity is worst...	1
7802	Kindly send me invoice copy because i received bill in poor ink and so i cant see properly	5
7803	Only meaning less beauty that needs protective cover all the time also it has camera, and hangging issueThis is first honor device and it is Wost phone with worst camera	1
7804	Mi A2 very slow working. Again & again hanging problems, speaker problem, sensor problem, connectivity problem(network), camera working stopped suddenly.	2
7805	I'm a old mi user and I'm a fan of mi. But Redmi 6 pro little bit disappointed me. I bought it from amazon great Indian Festival on October 18, and now I face two problem. 1 is hanging and 2 is auto reboot, and it happens many time. Now i don't know what to do.	3
7806	Thanks amazon...	5
7807	Its battery is draining fast.	1
7808	Have used the phone for a couple of weeks...Let's talk the pros first.1. Amazing build quality, glass biuld looks like a premium phone.2. True dual volte support, in other words you can use two JIO Sim cards at same time.3.Display quality is the best, Very small notch, you can hide it if you don't like the notch. Perfect for media playback.4. Great performance... Best in this range.. Gaming or running multiple apps it bosses, no lag whatsoever5. Battery life is very good... For casual users it will last for about 1.5 days...6. Sound quality is also good. But you have to play with the settings a little bit to get the effects.7. Camera takes some amazing pictures, the secondary camera should have been 5 mega pixels... Can't complain.Cons1. Glass build, attracts finger prints a lot.2. No gorilla glass as usual with honor phones..3. Camera struggles at low light and macro shots..4. No front camera flash, but. Still screen acts as flash.5. No fast charging, with the provided charges it takes 2.5 hrs for full charge.A must buy phone I would say at this price point...Use it with a tempered glass and good case if you don't want to break it...	5

7882	Definitely more than value for money..as I bought it in exchange offer. Touch and feel is impeccable.. good sound quality...camera is a bit more than average under dim light.. overall a good experience.	5
7883	Cons:1. Camera is awesome.2. Fast charging is good.3. Display is very good.4. Fingerprint sensor is fast.Pros.1. Snapdragon 450 is included which is not a good choice. It Should be better.2. Battery backup is not so good.3. Portrait mode is so slow.Overall I think it's a good phone but not so good for high end gaming.	4
7884	Battery is worst. It dead in 3 months	1

7894	This phone is very good mid range phone but only for moderate users who likes to watch videos and use social networking and some common apps but not for those who likes to play Games and do some graphically intense gaming or using apps which requires higher performance. Budget phone with restrictions...	4
7895	Being used.	5
7896	Friends think before you pay 15000k for the device.I got it for about 7k with exchange of my iphone 5s.ProsGood displayGood call quality.Didn't expect anything else from this device. ConsYou will feel mild heat while playing games or while heavy using with wifi connectionBattery back up is not that great.Camera quality is not as expected.Most of the apps hangs for example fb, Amazon. I dont know whats the issue. Mite be some bugs.Also while playing youtube videos on full screen mode, the video resolution does not cover the whole screen.Screen shot attachedGiving 2 stars for display	2
7897	Battery back up is not good...	3
7898	"I bought this phone at 15000 during the sale.....at this price point .. snapdragon 660... amazing pictures from both back and front camera.........but battery is only 3000 mah....and I love the sound quality of this phone.....""MI A2 IS KING"""	5
7899	Everything is too good. Just the battery backup is not as per the price.	4
7900	I think its a perfect phone in this price segment ..everything is just upto the mark .. no lag in performance .. it just heats a bit after long usage .. otherwise a great phone with loaded features	5
7901	nice product but picture and sound quality is not good.	5
7902	MiA2 is a good phone.It is very smooth because of its processor.The front  camera is awesome.This phone has a flash for both front and rear cameras and take descent pirctures in low light.The phone is light and has a good look and feel, even though a nother display is missing.Watching a movie or a show in full HD gives you a very good feel.The missing headphone jack has not proven to be a big issue as normally I don't use headphones while charging the cellphone.The battery charges from 0% to 100% in about 2 hours. And also the battery lasts for about a day with normal usage of about 5-6 hours in a day.Being a MI fan, this is my 4th MI device and the first stock Android device.Overall the experience is nice but I will still go for MiUI rather than Stock UI.Overall it's a good phone with a good battery backup, as many others have complained about this, It is not really an issue now as an update has been provided.	5
7903	Very Good phoneFabulous displayCamera okFace lock working properlyOverall good phone by LG	5
7904	The only thing I like about this device is the software! I don't like the camera, built quality is cheap doesn't seems solid. 'LED light seems glow the complete front panel'(while panel), battery life is good as you can't expect more from 3k mah. Sound quality not up to the mark.	2
7905	Face unlock feature was aswome. Bulid quality was very good. Full HD+ display  is more brighter  than others phone.	5
7906	Front camera is poor.	4
7907	Sound quality	3
7908	Excellent, very compact design	5
7909	Amazing display. Great looking phone. Works very smoothly.	5
7910	My first review.. Buy it for sexy look.. Front camera and upgrading your phone for next 2 years... Hardware not for gaming but decent..I got with good 4k exchange and 1500 off through Axis bank for and 14k and in that price it is worthy..With HD wallpapers it becomes slow and battery is although not great but can sustain full day use in Ultra Power Mode... We expect a better processor at this price or Huawei should update Emui version it is using on this phone.	4
7911	Wonderful product,  good price. Highly desirable mobile & great value for money with most features of mobiles of higher prices. Thanks Amazon.	5

7926	Best phone under this price....	5
7927	Overall value for money.Picture quality is pretty average, sound is okay-ish, battery is upto the mark for moderate to high daily usage.The red colour looks pretty impressive. 4 GB RAM let the device operate smoothly enough, coupled with 64 GB and expansion possibility, if required.Overall a device worth the spending7.4/10	4

7937	This phone is getting strucked but, sound , battery, display is good	3
7938	Excellent Device, stunnig display and smooth performance. Rear camera is excellent. Look premium. Overall superb. Loved it	5
7939	The product is worth only what you paid for. It is an illusion that you are getting a quality product at much lesser price. The picture quality is ok but colour reproduction is not very accurate. Camera is below average and inspite of the dual rear camera picture is decent only in bright day light. Battery is good enough to last for full day on moderate use. In fact it’s performance is inferior to Redmi 5 Pro.	3
7940	Touch is not so good  and processor  is very bad	2
7941	Awesome phone at awesome price. The one thing that is bad is lack of notification led else phone is really nice at this price from a brand like LG	5

7949	Display is super	2
7950	Processor is low as compare to another brands in this range.	5
7951	Camera qwality is too poor	1
7952	I am a redmi 3s user. Exchanged it with redmi 6pro.1. There is no much difference in performances between redmi 3s and 6 pro.2. Eventhough  it is dual camera, quality is still bad..3. Notch display is useless. We do not feel comfortable with it.4. Display is good.5. Frony camera is not good at all.Verdict :  For 11000 ,it is not worth. Go for any other models like asus zenfone max pro m1. My friend is using it.	1
7953	I love that this fullvision display,😇😇😇😇	5
7954	Speaker quality is too bad ,after putting completed to replacement no responed from ur technical person side, I will never go to buy on Amazon.	1

7959	Great product.....worthed the money.........but pubg lagged heavily....  So it is not for tough gamers!	5
7960	As such mobile is good.  But what we expected of its size, it is not at par with it. The overall size is the same only full screen facility is there. I would suggest the buyers, that they should visit the shop first see the model and then place an order. Moreover, the courier service was worst. I need to go there to get my product.         The replaced mobile is good. Its battery lasts for longer time. It gets charged early. Fast charging is possible. Camera is good. Battery back is good. Now...READ MORE	5

7970	I received the phone on 22 Jan 19, this phone does not switch on. I called Amazon call center and they has asked me charge for 3 hours and I did. Still no signs of charging and also the switching ON. Looks like I received a defective product. Amazon is asking me to wait for his technical guy to visit me for checking and see what can be done. Highly useless and time wasting thing.	1

Not draining vry fast.Bt 2 big prblm is..1 face unlock is nt gona work vry well2 u gona miss finger print for some days.Face unlock work well in which light u setup ur face.	4
8005	Better go for Real me 2 or Real me 2 pro if you need a better display,better UI,and overall features.The only thing redmi beat real me is its camera,specially its portrait modeope a software update could manage that issue.	3
8006	Size small and Quality Good	3
8007	Loud speaker of mobile phone gets automatically on even the loud speaker button remains unpressed. Battery life is also not good	3
8008	Good phone..	4

8010	camera is great , battery life is ok. Main the body is perfect shaped , feels premium .	5
8011	Don’t think twice before buying it. Writing this review after using it for 3 months. Go for it guys !	5
8012	Mediocre phone except for Camera..no headphone jack and the connector which is in the box doesn't work when the 3.5mm earphones is plugged...Do not recommend	2

8014	this  phone picture quality and sound quality  very good. but battery life not very good.only good.	4

8017	Good phone in this price range no heating issue	5
8018	Hiting problem	1
8019	Battery drain very fast.Good for photography.Processor is quite good support pubg smoothly.	3
8020	This phone is good with respect to performance and camera.  But the battery is not lasting for the whole day even with nominal usage.  However, the main problem is with the proximity sensor.  While attending the calls, the loud speaker  do not disturb , torch , battery saver options are automatically get enabled/disabled due to this issue.  I first tried to return the first phone due to this issue and was able to get only a replacement after speaking to Amazon call center.  Even the same problem arise with the replaced phone as well and then I come to know that the proximity sensor is a known issue with MI A2 and still not been fixed.  People who are considering MI A2 should be aware of this issue before buying.	3
8021	What a great product what a look everyone should buy in a cheap amount everything look great and fashionable like it	5
8022	system is not properly working	1
8023	The Best screen resolution and picture quality with great battery backup. Only thing that needs to be improvised is the front camera.	5
8024	Screen is 5 star..Build quality is 5 stars...Dimensions are 5 stars andit is also pocket friendly.LGs (S. Korean brand) makes good display screens better than other chinese phones.Battery life is also good for 1 day use.Best thing is the screen which is having replacement warranty of 6 months from the purchase date this is really super se upar as generally the first thing that breaks on any costly phone is the screen..which costs more than 1/4th of the price of the phone to replace.Dual sim is an added advantage.I had samsung s5..iphone 5s..and oneplus 5 but this complete package is great for normal and daily use.	5
8025	Price is too high for this mobile and xiaomi use sd 625 in this mobile realme 2 is better than this mobile	1
8026	Battery is not comfort	2
8027	Nice phone. Display quality is superb. Good brand value.Great job done by amazon. They delivered my phone one day earlier.	5

8039	I have been using this from past 2days. Need few more days for detailed review. But one thing is sure the phone is super sexy when u compare this with its competitors. Sleek and light weight.I was using OP3 and was addicted with dash charger. Here the biggest drawback is time to charge. A complete 96-97 %, takes arnd 2.15-2.30 HRS.	4

8068	This mobile is very handy and the screen looks good with all day battery. There is no lag found and the display beside notch is only to display time and SIM signal. The only con is that it does not support dual VoLTE and dual 4G.	4
8069	I got it delivered the next day so delivery is very fast. coming to the phone, it's fabulous, the design is awesome and it feels like premium. At 15,999 RS. it's a complete package. idk about the other people but to me there are only pros, whether it's the processor Snapdragon 636, camera 16 mp, ram 4gb, ROM 64 GB, audio and video all are incredible. thanks to Nokia and FlipkartREAD MORE	5

8128	I am like its full hd quality display	5
8129	Provide better headset	4
8130	The phone is perfect in case if someone is looking for a better display not meant for gaming and multiple apps usages as the user will face the lag. I could have rated it as a 5 star but the delivery was pathetic and I had to follow-up regularly with Amazon customer care to make the delivery. I got the delivery after 10 days whereas while ordering it was showing that it will be delivered tomorrow. After placing the order the delivery time was changed to +6 days, on top of that Amazon delivery person kept marking the reason premises closed when I was at home. So I had to complain to Amazon customer care who got it delivered after a further delay of +4 days. The total disappointment was the reason they marked that customer has requested for rescheduling of delivery whereas the entire flaw was Amazon courier team who kept on making unnecessary excuses. So in case if you have enough patience to wait longer and deal with Amazon customer services you can go ahead and order the phone.The only drawback of this phone is its processor, in the age of Snapdragon 6 & 8 series LG is providing 4 series processor.A lot many people have also complained about heating issues which was occurring while using data on phone, which entirely is the issue of the processor, not the phone. So order it only if the heating flaw is acceptable to you.The fingerprint scanner is missing, which I found is not really a big issue from the safety point of you. Knocking codes unlocking is available which comes out to be pretty handy.An added feature is face scan unlocking, which I recommend not to be used as the phone can be unlocked using the photograph as well of the user. Not really a safe option.	3
8131	Nice looking and good performance.battrey  backup wow .	4
8132	Solid!!! Fast!!! Loud!!! Very great build!! People who are complaining abt camera, try using a different camera app for better results. Very decent camera. Dont expect this to be like DSLR camera!! This runs pure Android. So constant upgrades and security patchs. It's a very bad idea to compare this with Moto g5s plus, configuration varies. U'll feel the toughness. Just amazing job by Hmd global. Highly recommended.	5
8133	Handling simple and safe pocket	4
8134	Not fulfilled expectations	3
8135	I purchased this device 1 week ago.  Front camera is worest, battery back up is worest. Phone heats up while palying PUBG(I know it is a advanced game). I was happy with my old phone. I made a mistake by purchasing this phone.	3

8154	👍👌👍Go for honor 8x guys, Best quality mobile better than honor play mobiles!!! 3700mah battery performs well!sound quality is also perfect enough for its single speaker!!!camera quality is best but while zoom you will see the pixel quality losses!! Other than dual 4G and VoLTE supports working fine! Its screen size is also little bigger than honor play models!!this model includes Ride mode, party mode, Huawei share options etc!!!dual Bluetooth is not available, but it beats honor play model mobiles and cost effective!!!seperate SD card slot is super! IT DOESN'T SUPPORT OTG DRIVES!!!! That's it guys, go for it, worth for money... 👍👍👍👌👌👌	5

8175	The camera takes a bit of mastering, but once you get the hang of it, it's a stunner! A budget phone, which can take near DSLR quality photo, a superb processor and 6 GB RAM to make gaming a breeze, and a premium look and feel, can't ask for more. Thank you, Huawei and Honor!	5

If you need more spex with same series, then wait for Redmi note 6 pro.still I love this phone.Its not big and not small..we can handle it by one hand and display clarity is too good..!!	4
8190	My first Honor phone.Battery is awesome but charging is slow.In my case it's taking 3 hrs and more to full charge but it's ok(from50-60% to charge).You don't need to charge your phone twice in a single day.Display is so supercool awesome.I saw Realme 2pro and it inhands ,there was a big difference ,Honor 8x is superb .It's slim too and design awesome.Everyone praised my phone.Value for money device	5
8191	I brought this phone on Amazon great indian sale. bought this mainly for photography. This is an amazing device. I am getting around 7hrs of SOT on low usage and on heavy camera usage I am getting 5 to 6 hrs of SOT. stand by time is so good. it remains standby for almost 2 days.	4
8192	It's an amazing product within the price range	5
8193	I am little disappointed by the battery and without fast charger.When I am using it some time it get heated.All is good👍👍This is about 17000 RS smart phone.It have only 3000 mAh battery	5
8194	Everyone are perfect looking also, but battery life is not good power would be something 4000 mah.	5
8195	Camera Quality : it's okay. It's better than note 5 or coolpad or honor 7 .... There is a displacement in picture, after snapping a image.Sound Quality: Sound is just wow. I am fan of the volume it can achieve.Battery life : battery sucks , dries in one go within 12 hoursUpdates : quite frequent ... Google takes care of android one. I am happy.Overall: it's a good phone for 15k	4
8196	You can give it a try	5
8197	Good battery. Sound and picture quality is decent.Light proximity is not good. Screen is dim in auto brightness mode.Phone looks bit heavier with hard cover.Charging the phone takes more than three hours.The keypad that came with phone wasn't good.

8239	Within a month phone stopped working. I visited service center, to my surprise they were saying u have opened it, hence motherboard is damaged. I was trying to make them understand why should I open new phone. They refused to repair the same under warranty, after long fighting with service centre they agreed to repair. But mother board is common problem of moto phones. Keep distance.	1

8246	Super phone. Awesome battery life. Great camera and great screen quality.	5
8247	Depending on everyone's expectations and usage it is tough to design a perfect mid-range device because that is where the expectation of most consumers need to be satisfied.Honor 8X is the best mid-range device of 2018Pros -•Clutter free UI. Almoet equivalent to what Google now launcher offers on stock android. EMUI doesn't add bloats and ads like MIUI rather simplifies usage with wonderful built-in features like ScreenCast, Screen Recording, Sound Recorder, health tracking app and other good features.• Front camera is awesome. The portrait mode is fantastic. All features look nice and easy to use. Rear Camera might not be the best one would expect considering how it beats competition in other scenarios but pictures are very good in most cases, even low light.•Battery is decent with screen on time of 10-12 hours on a single charge with video streaming of 3-4 hrs using wifi with Bluetooth headphone.•Phone is snappy, no problem with app launches or lags. Gaming is flawless for normal games. Games like PUBG should be played with medium graphics for best experience.• Dual 4G volte , ie simultaneously using 4G on both SIMs is flawless no speed drop. Kept calling using JIO while using Vodafone for Data.•Dedicated SD card slotCons -• UI update including dialer is an urgent requirement as the UI seems old. Expecting EMUI 9• Rear Camera should have been less grainy more smoothRest in a heavy usage of a week I haven't seen any troubles. It has only contributed to productivity and awesomeness.Without any speck of doubt it is the best mid-ranger of 2018.	5
8248	Easy to use. Good size. Good picture quality and good camera	4
8249	Delicate	4
8250	Screen size is little bit smaller than expected it's only.5.82 inch with a huge notch,also it doesn't support fullscreens display I mean in YouTube and video player etc,you are not able to watch any videos in full view display.so I am very disappointed with that a huge notch,and also it has only 5 mp front camera it doesn't support ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SO CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT GOOD if you are selfie fan this device maybe very disappointing for you, I have already returned this item,but Amazon CUSTOMER SERVICE IS VERY GOOD AND DELIGHTFUL EXPERIENCE DELIVERY TIME IS  ACCURATE..THANK YOU AMAZON... ;-)	1
8251	Phone's look is premium. Gud display.Camera is ok. Below average performance in low light but front flash helps a lot. Those who complain camera is slow, try using manual mode. It's pretty fast.14nm SD450 Processor is decent but not great while playing games like pubg etc.Battery is the biggest con in this. 3000mah will not be enough for heavy users.With gaming, YouTube etc it gives around 4-5 hours of screen usage time and total battery usage is around 9 hours for 100 to 15% or mixed usage with 3.5hrs of screen time and 15-21hrs total usage.	3
8252	If you were using redmi.. Zenfone and other budget phones..this one will be your beast for you!!!You will really love this phone..Writing my review aftr 5 days:It has lot of hidden features.. You need to identify them before using..display is awesome and touch is perfect.. Camera is good.. Byt you have to activate some effects to keep them good.. Face recognition is very fast.. No heating issues... Good battery backup.. Overall you can feel the honour of having honor😎	5

8255	It's not excellent, but overall a good phone.	4
8256	Superb phone only 1 problem chargeing slow and not dinger sensor rest good phone	5
8257	Good phone with all features inbuilt. Only thing is phone is a bit heavy to carry due to 4K battery capacity.Rest all the feature are common as compared to other MI phones.	4
8258	I love this phone... Really nice	5
8259	Greatly disappointed due to small size 5.85 inch with 19:9 aspect ratio  is very small in width and notch size is bigger and inproprtionate to screen size not recommended to buy better go for Asus zenphone max proM1.with the same price ,high processor, GPU good camera,big battery and screen size	1
8260	I loved lg phone. But this phone is not as good as other lg phones.I don't know why lg didn't make user friendly options how they made for their other phones.I don't know what to do.But its looks is soo good that I can't return this.	2

8268	Nice looking phone but after around 5 days ofusage this phone ui is not good as miui	3
8269	worth for this price	4
8270	An average Performer.Pros:--Stunning Design (Looks premium)-Full View 19:9 FullHD+ display though it has a notch but as its a 19:9 display u can always enjoy contents at 18:9 by hiding the notch-decent selfie camera specially for good lighting conditionsCons:--Underpowered CPU & GPU (it uses the same kirin 659 CPU that is on honor 9 lite a much cheaper model) so don't expect performance likeSD636 or 660-Average rear cameras bokeh effect is kinda artificial & low light performance is poor Camera is not a huge improvement from 9 lite- No fast charging at this price even though usb type c-Battery backup is not upto mark its strictly average doesn't  lasts a day.If looks isn't a concern i would recommend to GO for Redmi note 5 pro & save some bucks.Buy this device only if looks & selfies are your first priority.	3

8316	Superb phone. Strong build. Looks premium. Camera quality is good in daylight and poor in low light but selfie camera is good so selfie lover will love it as it also provided with Bokesh effect in front camera. Performance is good, battery life is good, Charging is fast takes about 90-100 minutes to get full charge from 0% to 100% which is very good.I will surely recommend it if you budget is 20k just for its premium look and build quality, fast and smooth clean Android OS and must buy for Nokia lover, surely a device you can rely on.	5

8335	Just Received Device Before 4 days , Good Packing and Fast delivery from Amazon india. here is pros and cons after  1 day use because volume button found not working since first day.  so I follow steps for refund as per Amazon policy service Engineer visit at my place and confirm report for defect, as per him wait for further process for refund . after 2 hours I contacted Amazon Customer Care twise they politely refused for refund as per policy we only offers refund for selected pin code only only replacement is possible this is really pathetic because I am here in india so why this facility for refund for selected pin only. very disappointed on this, as per they verbal they collect device next days then after receive product after approx 2 days they we recheck and send me another replacement phone, but without phone for week it is difficult. so my simple request is kindly give replacement in minimum time Line. here is some reason for I want refund  first I share cons on this device .cons :- 1) Calling incoming sound is pathetic and too loud which is most irrited .2) Rear and front camera is disaster. no quality of photos and videos in this price range.3) Excessive Hot to handle device even see 01 video on youtube4) Processor is not expect perform well.5) Worst gaming experience.6) Finger Print sensor not available it is ok for me but not all users.7) Sound quality is too weak point in this price range.8 ) In sunlight display is not visible properly.9) NO splash prof or water resistance feature. In this price range moto have splash nano Coating feature bring as value added feature.also I would like to share cons of this device which is best in this class , You have to buy if you ok with this pros.1) 18:9 Display with FHD LOOKS GREAT2) EASY TO HANDLE3) Build quality is stronger as per claimed US military standard of material use for making tough device which frame is consist of 7000 grade aluminium.4) Battery back up is good.5) 0 to 100 Full Battery charge time is approx 3 hours which is ok because it is not support quick charger.6) Easily Battery survive full day for normal use . some calls , Watch some videos and Facebook use for 20 minutes.7) LG brand name which is not made in China8) make in india device.9) Two sim slot and one sd card slot.10) Gorilla Glass 3 protection.11) Back side is made with plastic but quality is good.12) Looking Premium device in this price tag.Note :- Still headphone not use because I use for one day only. So I can't say quality of this accessory.  if you are normal users then go for it.  if you are heavy gamer or heavy user then go with another brand.  why I am rated 3 star ,2 Star For Display and Design and Quality build.1 Star For Amazon packaging and Delivery Process.  Why I am deduct 2 Star1 Star deduction for refund policy i think it must applicable for all pin across india.1 /2 Star Deduction for loudly Call voice quality, Deivce heats abnormal with normal use.1/2 Star Deduction for front and rear camera performance.  My intense is not hurt anyone it is only based upon my users experience. I m sorry if any person hurt . Thanks. Anis Amazon Customer	3

8339	Amazing sounds, picture, DSLR camera, battery life is good	5
8340	I bought this from Amazon some 2 months back. I found this is not a bad phone. A good phone to use for the people who doesn't like to play games on the phone and uses important apps only. Good Battery back up that works one and a half day long . Music player is Ok type, don't expect a boom bang.Picture quality of the camera is also not bad. Colors are vibrant and impressive so I am just satisfied. It could have been better.  Front camera takes good selfies in good lighting conditions. Both rear camera struggles in low light and image are full of noise. Images are impressive in the day light conditions.Considering all these aspects, I think this is not a bad phone to use once.	3
8341	Nice phone for easy uses	4

8374	Hi guys I bought this phone offline. This phone is very good except battery backup. 10 min 10 percent gone.Worst battery I have ever seen. I went back and replaced with different phone. You will really get sick of chrging this phone , even though you will have 3000 mAh battery , works like 1500 mAh battery. This issue is seen with all q6 and q6 plus models and they don't have a fix so far , so replacing it with the same phone will not help.dont buy this phone.	1
8375	This is awesome mobile with good camera. Picture quality is good. Sound is also nice. Battery life is OK. Not so good, not so bad (i do not play much games).I am little disappointed with touch quality, which is not up to the mark.But overall it is best phone in category.	5
8376	Good phone but two things are feel embarrass me those are it not support any memory card and  battery mah is low (3010 mah) is not enough for whole day using.. In this range the phone is awesome..Sound, Camera are mine blowing..	4
8377	Picture quality in evening and night is poorBut all over performance of the phone is batter then other phone in this segment	4
8378	Always good	5
8379	Worst Mobile.Note 5 pro is better than this mobile	1
8380	Except camera all others r good	4
8381	Top notch phone at a steal away price	5
8382	This is 3rd Redmi phone i buy. Before i had 2 Moto phones, so i did consider buying another model, but most other phones i consider had thumbnail scanner on front, i like it on back. This is good phone, i am not happt with the NOTCH they put on this phone.  I like phone with no NOTCH, may be that is a personal perference or not used to this kind of NOTCH.	5
8383	I used mi earlier again perchased mi 6 pro I can say its a value for money deal.	5
8384	I had a xiaomi redmi note 3, which i always felt was too big. this one is just the perfect size. it looks beautiful, feels really good in hand, and when you use it you realise how smooth it is. the software is well optimised and works extremely well. overall i think based on its performance this phone is definitely worth the price.	5
8385	Price & hardware spec are the pros	4
8386	Picture quality not as expected ...and cant able to use two JIO sim same Time	4
8387	Super awesome	4
8388	I thikk 3 star is sufficient for this product.	3
8389	Redmi 6pro mobile is very good performanceBut notch is hidden on videos playing	4
8390	Battery life superb👌🏼	5
8391	Pros :- Loved the camera : 5/5 Front , 4.5/5 Back- Perfect and clear pictures especially from the front camera- Beautiful display with notch- Sophisticated and sleek/sexy design- Easy to hold, not slippery- Looks good in hands- Pretty reflection from the back (I've ordered Blue)- Smooth settings and features- Android Oreo- Loud Speaker- Long display giving enhanced looks to all the applications- LED notification- Loud voice call- Great signal- Reasonable price- Charging speed is okay, not too slow like other new smartphone eg. MI- If you love iPhone only because of its looks, not IOS then this is the best Android for you beating iPhone design in budget- I preferred it over Redmi Note 5 Pro- Private Space feature turns into a new unused phone within seconds, for people who want privacy- App pin feature best when you're giving your phone to some other person and so that the person couldn't change to any other screen except the app you've pinned in recent application. She/He can't see anything except that app or the lock screen- Many features you would love in it, can't describe allCons :- Sometimes the applications freeze, the phone doesn't hang but the application freezes. Though it starts working well when cleared from the recent apps and opened again (not always has this problem)- Not all applications have new feature of full display provided by new generation smartphones, so applications need to be updated so that it works well with notch and full screen display- A lot of settings need to be adjusted for notifications banner and battery otherwise all your private notification data might show on lock screen plus drains a lot of battery if applications are not stopped from automatically restarting- I'm a heavy user so I need to carry power bank with me, after heavy use it can work for 6 hours then you've to charge it up (Syska 20,000 is the best)- Sometimes the speaker is so loud that the voice might crack a little, with a little noise though it's not noticable- Because of the notch you can't see all the batch icon above , or unseen notification batch number because the signal display covers half of the left side of notch if you're using dual sim	4
8392	This phone honor 8x is an beast. All-rounder. All the things are perfect. Must buy	5

8398	Overall the phone is really good. Looks really classy. Camera is exellent and screen is vibrant. But the biggest issue is the battery. I have been using it for 5 months and now i have to recharge it before the night. Atleast the battery should last 1.5 days.But if you are not an intense user of phone definately go for it.	4

Battery backup of this device is very poor. Phone got heated even if it is in the pocket. Camera is not also good. Its better to buy Samsung on nxt or any other Chinese device. Its price should be 5000 because there is nothing in this phone. I bought this phone because I thought it is from a well established manufacturer LG. If I could rate it zero star.	1

There's no such issues in terms of performance even you can play pubg in hd with high frame rate without any lagging or heat up issue .

8503	It's very good phone with a notch.......	5
8504	Poor design makes device dim..... display is not bright camera ok over all go for note 5 pro.....	2
8505	All is good.	5
8506	Hello, Friends don't buy! this productFront Camera - 00/10 badly poor performance.Main Camera - 6/10 overall good performance.Design - 8/10Dual 4G not supported. only one sim support 4g  and 2nd is 3g/2g.	1
8507	It's very hitting and battery parfomance is very poor	1
8508	Its clearity of camera is awesome.,smooth while processing	5
8509	Chinese phone makers are getting better now. At this price of 15000 you will not get any better phone than Honor 8X. The phone is a little longer with 6.5 inch of screen size, its bigger and better. The screen color is vibrant, brightness is good in indoor and outdooor conditions, it's. Edge to edge with a notch which is not a problem at all.The call quality is great, speaker sound volume  is loud but sometimes at higher volume the quality of the sound is below average. I recommend you to put the volume level under control to hear loud and crisp quality sound.Camera is great both front and rear but only in good lighting conditions. For low lights the on-screen front flash gives a real soft light effect which is really helpful for low lighting photography. Photos from both the camera looks good and crisp, you cannot take a better photos from anyother phone in this price segment.Battery life is also moderately good, however, you may need to charge it at night if you have moderate use. The only downside which i have experienced is sometimes while switching between the apps there is a slight lag or jerks. I think this is a graphic issue. I don't play games so it's not a huge problem for me, rather its just a non-fluid experience which i never had with my other smartphones. May be the software update will help fix this issue.Overall the phone can easy be recommended to anyone who is looking for a phone between 14k to 16k.	5
8510	Phone is good light weight but heat while charging.	4
8511	Pathetic battery backup. I give two star just because of battery life.	2
8512	No fingerprint scanner and back cover looks like a low rate plastic. Didnot like much	2
8513	i got this mobile for 13500 during festive sale + sbi discount, id say its cheaper then realmi while having a better camera ,sound quality via headphones and loudness via main speaker. I personally did not had any problem with battery life, may be i ma not a heavy user, but charging speed is quite good even with the supplied charger (1 hour full charge(as i start charging when i am around 20 and top up till 95)) . Display is very good...and design is premium bcoz of unibody and being very thin at 7.3 mm. Id say at 17000 it was slightly expensive but at 13500 its baaaang for buck	5
8514	Awesome from mi....just go for it...camera is perfect..😎	4
8515	There are heating issue after calling the phone going to heat after talking 15-20 min, this is not expect from the what can I do now for solve the problem can you help me...	4
8516	wowwwww effect*******🤗🤗🤗🤗✌️✌️✌️🤙👌👌👌👌👌	5
8517	Almost 2 months of use.Phone came in a very basic white box with even more basic earphones. They should rather not give one.Charging is super quick and easily lasts a day.Phone feels great and looks premium.Can be easily used with one hand.Camera is great both front and back although the rear flash could have been more powerful.The led notification lights way too dim. LoudSpeaker volume and ringer  a bit low compared to any other phone.Occasionally the phone slows down.At times Bluetooth pairing issues. I've to restart the phone and then it pairs fine. But it shouldn't be that way. The worst part is the tampered screen protector cause its difficult to find one that fits right. And the company doesn't bother to give one that fits right. I tried 3 different protectors but all leave bubbles on either edges because of the phones curved screen.Otherwise overall its a great phone. Value for money	4

8544	Good product but sometimes phone hanging	4
8545	A nice phone, I am using mi note 4 and my wife is using this phone, I must say this phone is far better than MI note 4 if we see the camera performance. Its ultra light and slim.	5
8546	Battery life meadium	4

8548	Battery life is worst	1

8551	Camera quality is very bad.	2
8552	I received the product after a looooonnng seven day period. Now, about the phone- I find it quite okay. I have been using it since the past seven days. Everyone else has already enumerated the features so I am not going to enlist those. It looks very pretty if that is a concern. My only problem is that the SPEAKER VOLUME IS VERY VERY POOR even with the earphones. Other than that I am not a hard core gamer. The phone is good enough in all other respects. The camera performance is as publicized, not satisfactory in bad lighting situation though. It does have a lot of fun little features and settings for you to explore.	4
8553	Nice mobile at this price range..	5
8554	After using this phone I observed that it is best selection in low budget mobiles.display clearity awesome and battery life also very good if you keep 100% charge it comes 2 days even if you are using internet.camera also good very good front camera it is not looks like 5mp. I found no heating issue overall good selection Redmi.	4

8590	Sounds quality is average.	4
8591	Best mobile in this price and gud features	5
8592	You have two reasons to believe my review1:I'm writing this review on the same phone2: I'm a flagship userSo off to the details.This phone is seriously underrated.Even in  flagship mobiles like the OnePlus 5T, Samsung Galaxy S8,The battery backup for my usage(24hrs Data on.Alternating between WiFi.6 to 10 rounds of PUBG and hours of social media,music,calls with data on,and a bit of location crunching)would be some 10 hours of that I'll get some 5 hours of screen on timeBut this phone even though it's low spec amazed me as it lasts a whole day getting 16 hours of standby and 10 hours of SOT in a single charge.(image included)RAM management is excellent and is smooth as I found no lags when switching to and fro large apps like PUBG to Chrome and back.Too damn good for a budget phone eh?And another miracle I experienced is...THE PHONE NEVER EVER HEATED UP.Its been 3 weeks of hardcore usage and I never found my phone heating up.The Camera is the only letdown here.The rear camera performs well as expected but the front camera is a total disaster.Face unlock works optimal thoughBuild quality is like a tank and tailor made for people like me who subject our phones to extreme pressure...The notch on a smaller screen does wonders as it exaggerates the screen to body ratio making the phone's display much more bigger than it already isIn conclusion if you want to get a sturdy reliable smartphone that would last a good 6 or 7 years with just a meagre sacrifice of the front camera..Go for it..The competition is eating it's dust for the moment	5
8593	very good phone in budget	4
8594	The best phone	5
8595	Battery drainage too much fast. Do not buy this phone. If budget allows then go for Moto	1
8596	Everytime when I go out of City and come back from an area of no coverage, my phone shows no network at all.Even if I search for network manually, it shows SIM network but it can't register to that network.	2
8597	Fingerprint sensor doesn't work some time	2
8598	It is having good battery backup. Screen is good. Only  con is lack of casting capability to TV using casting devices. It is necessity now to have this option. Hope they give the option in next trip update. It is a decent phone with good screen size	4
8599	Display quality is low and sound is not loud but battery is good and camera is good	4
8600	Pathetic product. The phone is already lagging in less 15 days of buying it. Apps take forever to open. Battery life is also only about 4-5 hours. There is problem in warranty return as well.	1
8601	Sound quality is not good.But in this range it's okay.Pics are good in good lighting but sometimes they are hazy. In low lighting camera quality is worst.Battery life is good enough for a normal player of coc but if u play PUBG it will drain and u would not be able to notice it even while playing.	3
8602	The phone heating at the simcard side	2
8603	Phone is heating too much.And there is  no hd voice calling supported on this device.	3
8604	Pictures quality is good nd good ps	5
8605	Good Phone in this price range	4
8606	Not much better as expected in 13k	3
8607	The touch is not working and product is not working only buying after two months. It’s such a bad experience	1
8608	Good product according price	4
8609	Good battery backup, fast & smooth phone.	5
8610	Camera quality is not to get but averageBut i m satisfied at this price i got this phone at 8600 only with exchangeSo u r looking for budget phone then try to buy this and if not satisfied then return it as early as possible	5
8611	I am using this phone from last 1 month and I really like it. I have not faced any problems with this phone.	5
8612	I bought this phone thinking LG would have finally put the goodies in a budget phone but like its said u cant always get what u expect.I will go with the pros first...1)beautiful display and body2)lastest android with LG skin on it3)Gr8 network reception4)Pricing5)one hand useThe cons over come all pros of this phone and hence the phone loses a lot to competitorsCons1) Blurry camera and picture quality is mediocre hopefully this is fixed in software updates.2) No fingerprint and face unlock is unpredictable and doesnt work in low light condition3)No Screen Mirroring present (In 2017 its hard to believe this feature is missing)4)Heats up and battery drains occasionally5)LG is known for slow or no software updates.6)Low speaker volume.7)No fast charger and headphones provided are of worst qualityAt this price range i would suggest you look out for redmi 4/nokia 6/redmi note 4 or a few samsung phones as this phone is only hyped on the basis of screen.LG did a gr8 marketing job but eventually Amazon customer reviews will tell the real story.	3
8613	This is the best phone I have ever used. Super quality	5
8614	Awesome Screen...	5
8615	Excellent phone at excellent price	5
8616	Awesome cellphone in this price range one and only one of the best cellphone... Go for it without any doubt..Battery is only 3750MAH but trust me it gives backup more then my previous note 5 pro.. could be honor is using latest processor which utilized less battery.. It gives 2 days battery backup with normal uses.The phone is awesome for gamers and casual users.The camera(both rear and front) are superb.Better than honor 9n and redmi note 5 pro10/10 design10/8 camera10/10 battery10/8 performance	5

8657	💙	5
8658	Awesome phone for that price	4
8659	This probably was my worst Moto phone. Worst in terms of battery life and phone sturdiness (compared to previous moto g phones). Battery doesn't last more than 12 hrs max and the phone would break at the slightest fall from even a height of 1 ft. Highly bad investment.	2
8660	It's quite a large phone, difficult to carry on a trousers pocket. Make sure you have a hands-on feel before you buy.	2
8661	Performance wise worst mobile.Do not go for this😡😡	2
8662	Its earphones are really bad...overall performance ok...	2
8663	READ THIS BEFORE BUYINGEverything in this phone is pretty except for some features but we can manage that, now the main problem is its display tech. guys. It is the cheapest display tech. which is used in this phone (tft display) . The main thing about phone is display. Due to the display everything you see whether it is a video or you play a ge, they are of entirely different colours. Ofcourse if you compare with other phone you will see. But to compare you need to buy and amazon people won't return your money back.	5

8740	Guys!! I am  using this mobile form last 5 days, phone is very good in terms of camera, battery and daily apps usage.One thing is quite frustrating is it plays adds as soon as you disconnect the call and that too in a loud sound.if you are attending a meeting and you finish a call on your mobile and then it starts playing some video in a loud sound and asks you to install the app. You will feel ashamed in front of audience. Please beware before you buy this phone. It is happening in huawei,honor and redmi phones.	1
8741	A Good Budget Phone..	5
8742	Design very good best product but Battery drain fast	3
8743	Built quality is awesome and feels premium in hand.	3
8744	Good phone. Highly recommend	5
8745	Battery performance is very low quality and picture is also same conditionThis product is useless	1
8746	Dislike for Amazon:Is delivery partner (eCom Express) are terrible. I waited 15 days for product delivery but dint get it even after that and at last I grabbed the product from DC on my own just because of my insanity for Honor 8x.Likes for Honor:-Premium build that looks good but feel good as well.- Large display with several personalization features.-Perfect Intelligence in rear camera. Clear photos, dont get blur on zoom in clicked through front camera not rear either.-Sharp processor performance.-Above average battery capacity, lasts for 1/2 day with continuous internet usage and calling excluding online streaming.-Deficated slots for dual sim & memory.-Large memory expansion.Just three deficiencies won't say dislike.-Pre-installed screen guard is not smooth that you can't swipe easily.-Sound quality is not above average.-Micro usb cable (means slow charging) however, it dont take much time to full charge.Its beast above all smatphones in its segment and price range.Must buy if you are willing to...	5

8763	Front camera is quite of low quality other than all functions are best in this phone.	5
8764	Compact phone full vision display so good	5
8765	Phone getting very hot. Yes very hot. On Sim slot side. Neither Amazon nor LG ready to address the problem. It seems LG is trying to clear stock of this worst model. Thst's why heavy discount was offered on this phone in recent Amazon mega sale. Dont buy. Your money will be wasted. My heard earned money has been wasted.	1
8766	One of the best budget phone	5
8767	Review after three days of usage....Camera - worst camera I have ever seen in this rangePhone Speaker - speaker is on the back panel and volume is too lowBattery Recharge - hmm, 3 hours to charge it full, are you kiddingFace detection - Poor, success rate of detection is less than 40%.Battery life - Avg.Performance - noticeable lag multiple timesedge to edge display is actually not edge to edgeSomething good about the phoneBuild quality is too goodlooks premiumFHDthat's itI have already already wasted my money but would not recommend you to buy this mobile.	2
8768	"I think honor has understood the customer mentality of what features does a phone require keeping in mind the most important factor ""COST"" that too with quality unlike other cheap chinese phones out in the market. I am a techie and use very expensive and high end phones in my day to day life. This is the first time i am buying a phone below 20K and i must says it is one of my best decision so far. The phone works really very well especially the battery which lasts me 2 full days with heavy internet usage. Picture quality, speed, UI, everything is at par for the price thsi device is offered. I am sure thay have few more high end devices lined up which is a tough competition to Samsung, Apple and other giants. Bach ke rahiyo mitroooo"	5
8769	All feature are good, best camera best performance, but battery is poor it drop in whole night by 25-30% while you not use phone.	4
8770	For this product the fight between me, my frd vs amazon was like 3rd world war while booking it will show guaranteed delivery by next day after booking it will show after 5days which is fine but after 5th day also we are not getting any update from the amazon 67 times we contacted the executive but not able to her any thing form there finally after 10days they placed order for the new one worst people in the world if you are not able to handle the pressure of billion days don’t even dream at it creating high expectations and eod not able to reach that 0 rating for amazon	5

8826	Don't go for it..feel cheated..so many good option available in this price range..different types of problems arises in two days use..trying to return the product..but returning mobile purchased in Amazon is proving just impossible..	1
8827	The phone looks damn sexy. And the performance is also nice and it is not suitable for heavy gaming. Battery is good enough for an average usage  but it takes too much time for a full charge. And the display is simply fabulous. But both the cameras are not upto the mark. Front cam is not at all good in low light conditions. And this handset is cool enough even in heavy usage. My final verdict is if u r a heavy gamer don't opt it. And I think it is the most sexiest phone under 14k.	4
8828	Display is great , battery back up is good, premium look in hand . Only concern is camera it is not upto the mark from good brand.	4
8829	The only thing which i don't like is front camera... Its very bad	5
8830	The features provided are excellent...for the price this is a extraordinary phone. Very good in sound quality, good picture quality...and functions like picture in picture, finger tip recognition..all are superb. I am fully satisfied.	5

8859	Earlier I was worried about which phone to purchase on sale. Almost looked for every phone in the market. But my options came down toRedmi 6 pro and real me 2While comparing real me 2 gave mi 6 pro a tough compatationBoth had battery back, notch screen(real me had an extra edge on both the features)But in terms of camera, screen resolution and ppiReal me 2 was way behindPros-Camera-9/10Display-10/10(430 ppi)Speakers-9/10Body-8/10(have a plastic finishing but looks great, and plastics have two added advantage- less heating and low jerk when phone falls)Processor-9/10Extra features- low light face recognition along with fingerprint, feather touch screen, 3 slots for 2 sim and memory cardConsPhone is bit bulkyBit costly if you haven't bought it on sale with respect to real me 2Old school looksOverall recommended	5

Same with Amazon guys.. and after so many rounds of talks with Customer care where I have given them remote access to my device even.. now they are saying that you have to give your phone to service center for repair... How disgusting is that... Rite now m really feeling cheated by MI as wel as from Amazon. I have given 1 star as it was the minimum I can give for reviewing.. but they deserve no stars for this product... really disappointed...	1

8886	Hi, all.I am using this phone for the past 3 weeks and below are my reviews.1. Camera is superb under 20K price range. If you are more keen on camera features it will be a good choice.2. Design of the phone is good and is not too bulky and less weight.3. Back cameras are placed on a bulgy area and chances are there to get scratch of the glass covering. We should protect if by using proper back cover. MI providing a normal cover along with the pack!!4. Battery :( I was using Redme Note 4 and really feels the Difference.. One day it will last for normal usage. If you are FB/Whatsapp freak, pls dont go with this model.5. Power Adapter-Type C would be a problem, since micro USB chargers are common. You may need to buy an extra adapter to manage while travelling etc.6. No idea what that are going to save by not providing 3.5 mm head phone jack provision. Its a real need. the adaptor provided is good, but it would be difficult for you to keep it along while travelling7. Got android pie update, its good that the device will get updates on time other than usual MI models	4

8895	Can't set the phone region to India. Laggy software. When using mobile network the phone heats up. Applications most of the time shut down unexpectedly. Camera is just superb as most of the photos taken can't be focused. A phone thats is oversold or Amazon Sellers robbed me. Anyway Good Job Amazon. Never buy a phone from AMAZON ever again.

8920	Everything is perfect but battery backup is not gud and memory slot also not available ..	1
8921	Fabulous ,  After using few days I am posting this review. Will try to cover almost all expect.1. Battery - I don't have more than 5 stars otherwise given to it. Wathched movies, heavy internet usage, app running in background, play couple of games and still battery lasts full day ,  Just WOW.2. Design - You can't get anything beautiful than this at this price. Looks premium, metal body, glass at backside , easy to handle, perfect size, physical buttons are at perfect reach.3. Display - stunning vibrant display, vibrant color in sun, comes with pre- applied screen protector.4. Camera - 20MP + 2MP dual back camera. I think camera is a little issue with this mobile, I tried  food photography, nature photos, traffic, night and some aerial shots, afterall i am disappointed with the camera. It has 16MP front camera which is for selfie centric people5. Security - Honor 8X comes with huawei security feature like fingerprint and face recognition feature. Fingerprint and face recognition is really fast.6. Performance - This device comes with Hisilicon Kirin 710, which can match up with SD 710. It made of four cortex A73 cores clocking at 2.2GHz and four cortex A53 cores at 1.7GHz. I did not found any lags while aying Pubg, Asphalt 9 Legends.Overall Great device at this price.#ReviewHonor8X	5
8922	I just love this smartphoneGreat design, good camera, best battery life	5
8923	Pictures quality is very good.	5
8924	Awesome looking phone. Full marks for design. Camera is ok. I have been using it for a couple of days. Those looking for a powerful performance will be disappointed. Face unlocking is impractical and useless. Earphone and data cable are of poor quality. Bought it at discount. 15000 bucks for this is highly overpriced.	4
8925	Cam picture quality not good, battery life is normal, mobile to much heat 5min. Voice calls ,camera side corner pressing the two fingers,off the display	1

8933	Good phone,  good picrure quality.....Lack headfone jack and face unlock...  But a good buy at this price	5
8934	Not better value for money.	1
8935	I had a thought not to buy this phone first, however, when I got an exchange good offer, I proceed for it. Now I am not regretting buying this product, one of the awesome phone ever, at the time of startup it got a little bit warm, but later it is now rocking. The performance is good, voice quality over the earphone is good, and the speaker is also good if you use a stand without keeping the phone on the ground, face recognition is awesome it is too quick and responsive. Battery back is Ok, but not upto the mark, though its drains faster than my old phone but manageable.	5
8936	Average cell phone	3
8937	i didnt get an bill	5
8938	Am using this model.most worst quality display clarity and battery. Heating problem also .Simply money waste.	1
8939	Camera goodDisplay depth is goodWeight is not best in this range..	5
8940	Its a good looking phone with brilliant screen but QC issues with LG.The first phone I received, the screen glass was not fitted properly, it was lifting from the top of the phone. Called Amazon and they arranged a replacement within 2 days which is great. The second phone again has SIM tray issues, the secondary SIM tray was jammed but as I will be using only one SIM, it doesn't bother much but LG seriously need to improve their quality control.Now coming to the Phone:Pros:Great screen - really sharp and good image qualitySize - Very easy to use one handedRam and Storage: 3GB ram good for multi tasking and 32GB internal with dedicated SD card slot is greatBattery: Easily lasts a day with normal usageRear camera: Decent quality for the price, in well lit conditions takes good picturesCons:Processor: Average processor and sometimes it takes time to load heavy applicationsHeating: Minor heating issues under normal usage like watching YouTubeFront Camera: Average at bestOver allPhone: 3/5Amazon 5/5---Will further update the review after using it for few more weeks	3
8941	Thanks to amazon for on time delivery. Redmi 6pro is price worth product, it's picture & sound quality is good. Battery backup is cool.	5
8942	PROS- very responsive, quik and buttersmooth.-almost perfect shape, very comfortable in hand.-awsome software with latest android is a very very feeling.-screen shape and the fhd 18:9 display looks cool.CONS- average quality camera,-inadequate battery power.-i personally didn't like the brightness part of the scren. Its kind of dull.-phone is a quite costly compared to other feature rich famous phones.	3
8943	Product quality is very poor. The phone got bent within 30 days of normal usage. And huawei says it is not covered under product warranty. Bad support and poor product.	1
8944	loveable camera ,display	5
8945	good mobile	5
8946	Face recognition not working properly	5
8947	Not worthy of 13000 RS it Should be below 10000, MI is selling this same product with in India with it's customized MIUI but globally selling Android one version. I am very disappointed with this kind of partiality....Are Indians fools	2
8948	very nice product.notch display is awesome, camera very nice.	5
8949	battery is really very good , front camera is bad , sound quality is not good not bad, display is best. overall best phone	4
8950	Battery discharge within day with avarage usage	4
8951	For 13.5k, this phone is amazing value for money. Pic quality is great. Screen clarity is very good (have not checked it in sunlight though). Really liked the night read feature (screen goes a little yellow at user defined times making it a pleasure to read in low light). It's sleek and has a nice grip in hand and doesn't feel heavy. Battery is decent (charge it once a day and you would be ok). Loved Amazon's prime next day free delivery.Few negatives - not for the phone but for Xiaomi.1. Xiaomi doesn't provide a data transfer app so moving data from old android phone was a challenge. Also, phone doesn't come with a quick 1st time setup guide so could be challenging to 50+ aged citizens.2. Few software related issues which I hope will get resolved eventually (eg : Cannot scroll down notifications using fingerprint sensor, timer for selfie isn't intuitive, etc)	4
8952	Its heating so much near volume rocker and power button	1
8953	This is the best phone till now I have used.

8974	Power button & Volume button stopped working Already went to service centre.Bought 15 days back only on 12th Oct17. Volume button is so hot where service person told it is normal. I don't know when again the power button and volume button will stop working. Waste of money. This is my first LG phone but Never ever in my life I will buy LG phone. Ecactly after my exchange window closed mobile problem started. Don't know what to do with this. Afraid to use because of the amount of heat it produces.	1

9000	Everything is good but some battery issue  and sound is too slowNot fast charging.It taking almost one hour to charge	4
9001	Bought this phone for Diwali.Brand LG drove me to opt this.Iam 100% satisfied by this Phone in its price range. I got it for 12900 from amazon as part of its Great India Festival. And an additional 3500 discount fro exchange of my Old Motorola 1st edition Moto G. So on the whole I paid(12900-3500)= 9400. Aspect Ratio is Killer. Camera is Good, Sound has clarity and Huge. Face recognition is 3.5/5, Only problem is 1.2 Amp charger which takes time for Phone to get Charged. But I see those as small flaws and does not impact my Usage.	5
9002	The headphone adapter provided with mobile is not working well. It's duplicate. Otherwise mobile is awesome!	5
9003	The phone is too good	5
9004	TBH I didn't like this phone. I got this with much expectations but it's just okayish. My old lenovo A7000 is actually better than this. The picture quality is just bomb but just with the back cam. Front cam gives a kind of fake image look. Back cam is absolutely stunning. Battery life is just average. Quick charge is not available. Phone hang tremendously. It's just been like a month but phone looks like old one. Get some better phone. Don't go for this. I really don't recommend this to anyone	5

9031	Overall rating is good. User can easily go ahead with this product without any doubts. First time I am experiencing notch display and it's performing well as of now.Battery back up is good.Camera quality is also not bad.UI is very attractive.Earlier I had redmi note4. Comparatively battery back up is less for redmi 6 pro and lack of small features had experienced with the new product. Thank you Amazon for such a good service.	5
9032	Camera is too good and awesome mobile in this range	5
9033	Very worst in screen resolution only 720x1480 not satisfied in gaming performance.Don't buy it	1
9034	"Everything is awesome. Great display good quality sound, good network reception,  Exceptional camera...LG is poor in marketing Mobile phones. This Q6 is a beast. Think about it's elder brother G6... It can dominate if marketing was good.Those who doesn't use mobile phone as ""Phone"", don't look into this. Yes 2K display consumes more battery if full brightness. Along with this, if you play video, you can see quite a bit of battery consumption soon.Why you need your finger print scanner when this phone can unlock just by looking at it (face detection).To conclude,"	5
9035	Well can expect more for this, there are minor problems in phone which annoys a lot, like call disturbance n cant hear the other person voice properly etcBattery life is very good.Camera - dont expect more.	1

9061	Received on 13 Oct 2018 and found that one speaker is not working.... Overall its value for money except sound problem...What to do pls suggest.	4
9062	Huawei made me go back to Android after 5 years - very very impressed! I bought this for just 15,500 at an amazon sale, as a backup phone. I am currently using an Iphone 7 and trust me, Huawei can give it a tough competition in - Looks, Full HD Screen Resolution and Selfie camera. It also has a type C charger.  The quality competes with the likes of Iphone and Samsung, so its definitely above the Vivo, Oppo or Mi league.Some things that can be improved:1. Rear camera - 16 mp is nearly not enough and photo quality is bad2. Battery at 3000 Mah drains pretty fast3. At a retail price point of 23k, it needs to offer fast charging4. No Video stabilisationIrrespective the cons, I think at 15,500 these specs and performance is pretty amazing! Well done, Huawei :)	4
9063	Nice quality... A good product from LG... The sound, software, picture quality is good... The front camera is poor... The screen is weak so do handle with care..	4

9112	This is just wow i got this phone after reading so many reviews but bullshit if you r not a gamer then its a blessing for you go for it.everything is perfect each and every feature is perfect and most importantly before these smartphones arrival we have used a phone with 2000 mah then don't worry if you want a good smart phone then mi a2 is your all time favourite...	5
9113	A great phone, an all rounder except for the cameraWhich performs okay in normal conditions but poor in low light and dim light conditionsGo for the phone if camera isn't your priority	4
9114	Full jesture mode is not given like mi note 5pro. And face unlocking vanishes often..	4
9115	Wanted a phone with a notch, because I loved iPhone x but couldn't afford it..This phone delivers much more than what you could expect in this price range.. You can go for it without second thoughts..Battery is good, but not great. No fast charging is a draw back..But on the whole will be a worthy choice	5
9116	Very goodsmartphone premium feel with middle range budget	5

9150	Before buying this mobile, I was really confused by few negative comments posted.  However, after buying and using, I can say that most of those negative comments are intentional to impact the sale of this product.Samsung Galaxy J8 is excellent in many ways.  Very good screen.  Excellent Cameras (both rear & front) with superb features.  Huge storage.  No lagging at all. Very decent battery back up for normal daily usage. Fingerprint sensor and face unlock work absolutely fine.  The features available in J8 are similar to many high end models of reputed brands.A mobile phone should be seen and used as a mobile phone and we should not be naive to expect the mobile to work as a PC, mainly at a sub-20K range of mobile.  I will suggest to ignore all negative comments and go for this Samsung Galaxy J8, if you want to buy a new mobile at this price range..	4
9151	Awesome phone, more than as expected according to its priceBattery back up is awesomeNice clicks during the day	5

9157	"Superb phone under 15 k means value of money.I like the 6 fonts given in the phone which I have not seen any other android phone.Whole screen covers with view hence even 5.5"" screen looks as 5"" screen only means you will feel it as small.Face recognition screen open is new concept in this phone.Night view mode in the phone is really suprb.Built quality excellent metal pack from all side.Jio runs superb ... very fastHappy with back camera 13MP day hour pictures very nice but night time picture little dull ..Front camera is ok..Sleek design....Out of 32GB 28 gb is available..Battery Life Excellent means 1.5 days with full charge and fast charge is 1.5 hour full from 18%.

9160	"honest review! this review is step by step un-boxing in wordsALL GOOD:-This phone looks really good.The presence of plastic at the back doesn't make it feel bad or cheap and it has nice grip but prone to scratches.Switch on the phone and it loads easy and LG interface looks really clean,very smooth and extremely responsive.Screen ""the Full Vision display"" is the catch and it is better than the MI ones and other in the same category but one can always argue that its just a marketing gimmick but yet ill say its better than the rest.FaceID works good but ill suggest to improve it like phone suggests.SnapDragon 435 with Nougat backed by 3GB+32GB is alot better than i expected.MI phones with 435SD is not close to the responsiveness of this phone!!.I dropped it once or twice but its all well without any covering but make sure to get a Tempered Glass.ALL Wrong:Why a phone that is 15k has only 435! this is where LG lost to Redmi! I get it, most companies in the market is pairing 435 with Nougat (android N) and after using this phone i understood that it works well but still 15K demands for a chip-set from 625 series.Such a poor front facing camera!! almost every pic is washed out and the front facing flash is nothing but a software trick! Read camera is OK nothing to boast about.Overall LG failed in camera department but i feel we don't have much to say about other phones cameras as well unless its a dedicated camera phone like in ViVo or Moto series.This phone has gyroscope and other sensors and i have read reviews saying it doesn't have which isn't true.See attached pics.Overall the selling point of this phone is its Full vision Screen and its really good but if you expect that everything runs full screen thats not the case.Phone functioning is smooth and responsive> I bought this with an exchange by back offer at 10k and i find it worthy if ti cost it 11k at max unless your usage is not much intensive and you like to show off a good looking phone!"	4

9195	Using this phone for the past 10 days. It's main highlight was the camera, which is absolutely great. with a 16+5mp rear combo you can click some great shots. Low light capability is also very good. Front camera is decent but could have been much better. The Super AMOLED display is awesome and has a good amount of sharpness. In the case of prossesor, the Snapdragon 450 is decent, but not great. They could go with a higher version of chipset considering the price. But It can handle heavy games...READ MORE	5

9200	Lookwise phone is good but there are some serious issues with the phone which can be debilitating1.Infamous hotspot problem which has been reported in many handset not just one or two. Hotspot just keeps on toggling between on and off. You won't be able to use it and it's really frustrating.2.Camera is of poor quality. Images are grainy even in sufficient lighting condition, not expected from LG.2.Usb tethering problem .you might be getting full network coverage on your phone but USB tethering just refuse to give you net access on your laptop via USB.3. Sometimes video call i.e video over LTE ViLTE just refuse to connect.4.Phone processor is entry-level which is readily available under 7000 like REDMI 4.5.Heating problem is serious.6.In a nutshell it's not worth RS 14999.	1

9231	Xiomi India has certainly worked hard on their mobile phones and their recently launched Redmi 6 pro phone has started proving them right in following terms :1. Great Battery Life extending up to 2 days without charging (Normal uses up to 16 hrs per day) as committed by Xiomi.2. Screen Size coming with Notch (No other mobile phone company offering this feature at this price range)3. Picture Quality has really increased a lot and HD videos are playing flawlessly4. Camera Quality is awesome and even in low light photos are coming neat and clean especially from 12 mp primary camera.5. Earlier Redmi phones used to get heated in continuous working, till now after  using phone for last 8 days no heating problem has been observed on Redmi 6 pro.6. Battery charging time has also been reduced and phone getting charged in a shorter span of time.The weight of the phone has been increased a bit as compared to Redmi Note 5 pro.In my personal opinion in a price range of up to Rs. 13000/-, Redmi 6 pro is a Great Deal having increase in Specifications, Features, Style and Quality.	5

I received 1000 cash back for using Amazon pay for the payment.Camera : AI features really performing well.Both rear and front camera is giving awesome PICTURES.NO IssuesBattery life: It lasts about 1 day for me.If you continuously uses then it comes upto 8 hours.Speakers: sounds well. Being at the bottom if you closes the speaker with your finger it's really not that much great. But at normal times it is good more than enough.	5

9252	I've fallen in love with the display, a vivid and bright display within 13k. I am very disappointed with the camera quality, day light images are OK, it struggles a lot in low light. Audio quality on phone is good. Battery lasts almost 36 hrs on moderate usage.  Performance is good, I haven't face any lagging yet.If you are not an photoholic,  you can definitely go for it.	4

9291	I ordered this phone on 13 Aug 17 and the delivery date was 18 Aug 17 during this 5 days i read all the reviews updated by the certified buyers after that i get confused by all those reviews and i think should i cancel the order or should i take the risk many of the review mentioned about heating problem camera front and rear processor etc finaly one review was useful to me writing the phone is best for normal using not for heavy gamers finally the phone delivered on 18 Aug 17.After using 2 days i was writing this review the phone looks premium performing well. As written by others it has heating issue at initial when you are browsing watching videos downloading but after continious using it becomes normal this issue is negligible. Both the front and rear camera is normal display and touch is superb mind blowing battery last for a day.Battery last for a day before this phone i am using optimus 2x lg which battery last for only 3 hrs of continious using which is very horrible. After that i was worrying about the battery performance of this lg q6 phone but great job lg has done this phone battery last for a day easily of normal uses. If you are looking for this phone do not get confused go ahead this is better than those chinese phone at this budget	5

9307	Best brand for less price	5
9308	Sleek design. Feels much more premium than it looks, particularly the metal rim that surrounds the phone. Display is vibrant and Colors are punchy. I'm using it as a secondary phone and it serves that purpose well. The face unlock is very gimmicky though and makes me miss the fingerprint reader. The UI isn't the best and takes quite a bit of getting used to.	4

9320	Issue with notch while playing videos	3
9321	Price should be less for 625 processor,as realme 2 pro is giving bigger screen with better processor it's antutu score is 74000 while realmente 2 pro has benchmark score of 1,32,000	3
9322	"Frankly, Q6 is for people who have no great expectations at 15K price segment. Ofcourse, if you pay 15K, the brand won't let you down in many aspects. It is not a camera phone but a good camera in the phone. The design is remarkable!!! Display is a critic in himself. If this is not the perfect answer to your query, Open YouTube and search for ""rajeshroy402"" and watch the detailed reviews."	4
9323	Finally A Non Chinese , international Brand Roars with new Face scan tech. Smooth function and a good Camera . Device's look is also little diffrnt from Chini copy cat Mobiles. Well done LG Global. Poor people can opt for chinese phones for more functions.	5

9370	Size	5
9371	This phone is a boon for a stock android lovers with completely Bloat Free software.Display is crisp and more than descent for this price point.Although the Battery is of smaller capacity it lasts for a Day with average usage.SD 660 coupled with 4 GB RAM is enough for day to day usage with more than average gaming.However it lacks expandable storage support, which can be a deal breaker for most of them.Talking about the Camera's performance, it is one of the best phone at this price point. Although the portrait mode is kind of hit or miss the outdoor photography with light is perfect for clicking pictures. The front flash is a saviour for the night selfies.	4
9372	Pros:Strong performance for the priceClassy build qualityPure AndroidCons:Screen brightness low and adaptive setting way offNo NFC or headphone jackLimited availabilityKey Features5.99-inch 2160 x 1080 18:9 IPS LCD screenSnapdragon 660 octa-core 2.2GHz4GB RAM64GB of storage12MP + 20MP dual rear cameras20MP front camera3000mAh batteryFingerprint sensorVerdictThe Xiaomi Mi A2 is a phone that punches way above its weight. A few hardware shortfalls and limited availability drop it just short of an automatic recommendation, but this is deeply impressive stuff from Xiaomi.Why buy the Xiaomi Mi A2?Beyond performance this is a well-built, stylish (in a slightly derivative way) phone with a highly competent camera. The inclusion of stock Android 8.1 Oreo really completes that premium feel, and puts the Mi A2 beyond many of its affordable Chinese rivals.A couple of drawbacks prevent it from being an unequivocal recommendation, however. The Mi A2’s screen doesn’t get bright enough, and the lack of both NFC and a headphone jack are tough to swallow.Ultimately, though, the biggest downside to the Xiaomi Mi A2 is that it isn’t more widely available at the time of writing. If Xiaomi can really commit to a global launch of this range in future – and iron out those creases – it will be onto a winner.	4

9417	Left speaker not working on all phones, I have checked 3 phones and found the same issue.	2
9418	First up all the mobile doesn't support dual 4g network. Mi UI is not that smooth as compared to android one UI. In the notch notification part no app. notification icons shows. Camera is below average. The Ambient light sensor not performing well in low light conditions. And has a common Mi body build. Though the battery is performing good and the screen resolution is good but the cons. are really hurting, in daily use of the device.	3

9427	Nice phone with good quality camera	5
9428	I ordered it on 11 Oct. and got this on 13 Oct, thumbs up flipkart for fast delivery and after 1 week of usage ...i am satisfied with the Phone ...and battery is just massive...insane backup ...and they should improve camera but that is not a big issue for me,afterall camera gives descent results...Overall this is Amazing..😍😍😍😍😍TOTALLY SATISFIEDREAD MORE	5

9431	Total package except for camera.good phone in this price from mi	4
9432	This is one of good smart phones in this range.. Feels very premium. Camera, Display, Design are awesome. Battery drains quickly. normal usage will lasts maximum one full dayProximity sensor stopped working after 3 months of use. Charging will not work sometimes. Never expected this quality from Nokia.Trying to change mobile now.READ MORE	3
9433	Delivery as usual Amazon does a great job on time delivery.About the phone, it looks premium at this price. The size is perfect, it's slightly smaller in size compared  to honor 9 lite. The difference is in mm. I have provided the image where I have compared my old phone Xiaomi Redmi 2prime which has a screen size of 4.7'.  Perfect to hold in one hand. Slightly slippery due to glass finish you need to be careful.. It's cool, people easily assume it's iPhone X..I have used for a day, it's good for a mid range user like me whose don't use too many apps or games. Camera is excellent especially the selfies. NFC would have been a advantage..Seller please correct the details of its in the box. The webpage says we get type C adapter.it isn't in the box nor screen guard on the screen of the phone.. surprisingly I gota ear phone with mic which is actually not mentioned on the box nor on the webpage	4
9434	Hmm Music Lover ???Well i m.When i connect my Headphones with the LG Q6 i m surprised, the audio Output with the good headphones is really Awesome.Even the speakers at the back are also loud n Clear (i read somewhere in the review that the speakers at the back is not that loud)Display 📱 - only one word AWESOME.Camera 📷- The REAR CAMERA is really good. Pictures r sharp,colors looks vibrant too.Low Light camera performance is also good.yeah there is no pro mode but still i m happy with the camera performance.FRONT CAMERA - Not good but more than average performance.I THINK 5mp CAMERA DOES ITS JOB WELL.Battery 🔋-Depends on the usage But it is able to survive a whole day.U.I -when i got this phone there is no app drawer but same day i got an update n now there is two options available HOME(there is no app drawer here) ,HOME & APP DRAWER.APP KNW AS LG MOBILE SWITCH helps u move ur data From ur old Phone to this phone n i love this. All u have to do jst Select the Usb option connect both the phones with USB cable LG Q6 needs OTG Adapter n here u go.PERFORMANCE 🎲- Well i saw some ppls said tht LG Q6 heats ,BATTERY drains Fast. BUT BELIEVE me There is no heating issue (YEAH THERE IS LiL BIT HEATING AT THE LEFT SIDE NEAR VOLUME CONTROLLERS,WHEN U PLAY GRAPHIC INTENSIVE GAMES BUT THAT IS QUITE NORMAL) BATTERY will play with you all day, in a single charge and remember that FULL VISION DISPLAY if you talk about battery.SECURITY🔒- i known that FINGERPRINT SENSOR is MISSING but i dont care, when i look at my phone. I M A CLASSIC PATTERN USER .	4
9435	Picture,sound and battery life all r expectable	4
9436	Good Product but this time delivery service was very poor no proper customer satisfaction..	3
9437	Outstanding	5
9438	Cons:1. software is a bit slow. Applications don't open quickly. Process is bit slow during surfing in Google or any social platform.2. Slightly heating issue3. Network doesn't connect if there are 2 SIM  Cards. U don't listen ringtone when u call to any number but call will be answered. It happens sometimes but not every time. My friend also facing the same problem who bought this phone. Its not network operator problem its purely huawei problem.4. Doesn't support 4G+4G. It's 4G+2G5. Sound quality is Medium.6. No stabilization in camera7. Quick Charge take 90-120 min to complete 100% chargingPros:1. Stylish look2. Good Notch & Display3. Decent Cameras4. Good Battery back upVerdict :Eventhough software is a bit slow we can buy it for its premium look & for 4 pros . Hope they update software to resolve software issue. Heating is not too bad. We should handle it carefully since it is Slim & Delicate.Amazon courier service is very pathetic. I ordered mobile on 2nd May but received it on 7th by 9.30pm after I follow up with custimercare nearly 5 times otherwise I wouldn't have received it another 2 days.	4

9449	Not that good as expected because mi a1 was a way better lounch	3
9450	Nice Product from LG	5
9451	Worst product. High priced. Less performance due to outdated processor. Better option availableat considerablelow price. This product will soon be abandoned.	1
9452	In this World, the most difficult is to find best phone in your budget. Because there are many Options we have and we have to find one that best suit to us.(1)Honor 8X Design is Awesome and No one in this price can get this awesome design(2)The Small Notch and Small Chin is a very perfect screen and it's definitely Same size as Redmi Note 6 Pro . Because it has small Bezel. So you can use 6.5 inch easily with one hand if you are habit with Redmi series phone(3)Rear Ai Camera is very good. The night mode Really deserves likes and Many AI mode are goods. The Super Slow Motion captures 480fps is supported in these phone which never get in other phone in similar price.(4) The Speaker Sound is not so loud . But I am person who not worry about speaker quality.(5) Front Camera is Not so Good like Many other in the Similar Price. But it's still ok. I hope Honor give some updates in Front camera(6) Android Pie is not available now. But it should be coming soon(7) Fingerprint Lock is extremely fast. Face unlock is also fast , work in all conditions except very dark area.	4

9476	Nice phone pe bau Very happy  this device for using I suggest all buyers buy this samrt phone.... .	5
9477	Selfie not upto the mark. Airtel coupons for 2000/- useless as majority of the customers use 399/- plan for 84 days & not 199,249 for 28 days & neither 499/- plan, so better if 399/-plan is also included so that coupons can be used else I can surrender them. Return/replace request for two major reasons was also not. Considered.	1

9509	Loved the phone and its features looks are of top end phone and fits the hand perfectly...	5
9510	Display is bigger in length that Redmi note 4 but width is bit quite smaller. If u have used Redmi note3\4, u will be bit upset.Camera is good, clear pictures.Watch front panel, outline is black. Watch pic of mobile on Mi site and other sites carefully. it is not attractive as Redmi Note 3\4. You might get upset here as well.Touch is absolutely smooth.While taking selfie, you might have to struggle to adjust everybody in screen because camera options are eating almost 1/3 of display. SO u won't be able to see full display while taking selfie.Overall I will rate 4. Rest after using phone.	4
9511	The mobile phone's performance and appearance are good but it gets heated in continuous used.	5
9512	#redmi 6 pro good version for budget segment.Portrait mode superb n battery two day work. Gaming performance superb no lag no heating for game play I have use in 1 month.	5
9513	Awesome phone with its super build quality.1. Phone speed is awesome in terms of software2. Brightness is lovely as iPhone x3. Edges are not curved as vivo v9 and xiaomi note 5 Pro4. It Is so luxurious like iPhone x5. On paper battery is small on no but it works fineProblems in phone1. No image stabilisation2. Headphone are awful u can replace with its back cover3. Camera features are trickyConcerning after using it some features can be add like image stabilisation, easy to use feature like bokeh mode after software update.4. Lowlights images are not gud as image stabilisation is missingPeople who are complaining for the back cover is so poor. Before buying u can read no backcover is included. Giving 5 stars because all problems can be solve after software update otherwise 4 star	5
9514	The delivery i received was a day before the date. I will thanx amazon for that. The product is just awsome. I m love in it. I will suggest everyone tht if they want to buy a phone in mid range budget(15k) then they can definitely go for honor 8X.fully value for money.	4
9515	Good  need lmprovement  on camera	5

9523	Snapdragon 625...	5
9524	Value for money, Xiaomi has maintained their quality standard. 5 stars for the product	5
9525	Awesome mobile,valueable price....	5
9526	It is a good phone with a good display,  although would have preferred a option for 64GB storage with 4GB ram, along with a fingerprint reader.	4
9527	Performance wise is very slow, dont buy this phone	1
9528	This device is good for camera	5
9529	Just amazing. Looks stunning in black colour with glass finish. Too good in size to hold for single hand usage. Huawei could have bundled a case with the device instead of earphones as its slippery. Love it for the premium look.	5
9530	Serious heating problems.You can not do multiple tasks simultaneously.Gets heated too much only on using 3G internet just for 5-10 mins.	1
9531	Recommended to buy, no issue till now,fare with price	5
9532	Nice.	4
9533	The phone is good in it's camera and performance. Speaker is nice. But it does not support 3.5 audio jack. For overcoming that , the package consist of a dongle. It is of very worst quality , as my dongle is not working after 5 days of usage. Now I can't use earphone with the phone.  Also while taking pictures on zooming , it does not be satisfactory. The battery backup is also an average. Otherwise phone is good. If anyone wants to buy this phone , then please buy it through mi.com . I bought it from Amazon and there customer service is very poor. They are not willing to replace the dongle which is not working.I gave only 1 star due to this poor service from Amazon.	1
9534	This phone has a ghost touch problem. Ringtone sounds are going down to vibration mode continuously without my interference.	3
9535	Battery backup is too low	5
9536	The phone has come with andriodone software. You can buy	5
9537	The Looks, performance and features of this phone can compete with high ended premium phone.I am the member of Amazon from 2015. Till this today it gives me best service.	5
9538	Getting restart often, not good for longer run :(	1
9539	Looks is poor. Very bad Performance, Camera quality Totally Worst. Please everybody do not buy Redmi 6 pro. Go to Realme 2. I wasted my money.	1
9540	Awesome product...hats off to Amazon.in	4
9541	Phone is good. Display is amazing.. Camera is decent.  BUT heating issue with normal usage (even when u r not playing games or watching movies) , i mean its big problem.. too irritating. how many of u facing this issue? LG are u gonna fix this with software upgrades?	2
9542	outdated processorand Bakwas UI	1
9543	Worth of each penny and great phone is Redmi 6 Pro.The only drawback is that the display does  not utilize the complete screen while playing videos and pictures!	5
9544	Poor performance in every department except camara	2
9545	Frunt Camera quality is low	5
9546	Ordered on Oct 02 and received on Oct 3rd. Fastest delivery by Amazon. Thanks for that.Talking about the phone,its great value for money! Excellent screen, great battery and good camera. Can't ask for more at this price.	5
9547	Great phone with great features. Nice camera and sound. Little heavy due to heavy duty battery. Best package in this price range. But till now I have not received my cashback money...	5
9548	Was confused between q6, nokia 6 & samsung j7 max, very happy to own Q6 after using it for 6 days now. Its Full HD Full Vision Display is much superior then any other smartphone as they used TFT disolay which is an outdated one. Fast processing as its 4GB RAM is clubbed with quolcom snapdragon processor where as others uses mtk and Exynos which is slower. Q6 comes with a premium design and superior build which is easy to hold.I have been a fan of LG for their superior hardware and easy UI, keeping the price right for Q6 can give (good) run for money to all smartphone manufacturers.	5
9549	Superb device in mid price segment!	4
9550	Though the look is OK, the software has lot of flaws that needs to be fixed. Not a user friendly system they built.Expecting them to be fixed in next MIUI version.	2
9551	Processor is not so good... Should go for Redmi Note 5 Pro	4
9552	It's one of the most fastest phone wat I have ever seen it	5

9627	After 1 month usage, i find the phone overall to be good in this price.Few cons:1) notification light is very tiny that u dont even feel its there.2) since back surface is of glass, it easily slips off ur hand and on slant surfaces.3) catches finger print marks very easily on the back surface4) phone size feels big in a normal hand	4

9644	User interface is great.Camera quality and finger print scanner works really fast.Rest is great.	5
9645	The phone has got a great display but that is it. Sound output is poor , Back camera is average at best nd front camera is way below par. Old processor means phone lags on occasion . When u pay ₹13000+ you expect the performance would be good . But this phone is disappointing on many levels. However people who don't use there phones for multitasking or heavy gaming and just use there phones for calling and occasional other uses can consider this phone for its brilliant 18:9 display.	2

9731	Hotspot is very low grade as usual  because i have been a user xiomi mi A1. The camera is not upto the mark as comparison to the A1. A1 have a way better camera than A2But A2 should have upgrade version of camera having 12+20 but truely saying not good. Leaving the portrait mode behind regular mode is also😠 not upto the mark.	3

9733	Good for purchase.	3
9734	I like the design and look of the phone but the camera quality of the phone is very bad. I purchased it because previously when lumia come they also have Carl's Zeiss camera but their quality Was far better as compared to nokia 6.1 camera.	3

9739	After nearly some months of using this phone I got to eventually hate this .. thought moto was good .. but now the battery backup is not that good .. but in only standby the phone goes for2 days ... Else have to charge two times a day.. also it is not fit for playing heavy games..it lags a lot and sometimes goes mad it does not respond to touch and shows something else..There are many good phones at this price point..please opt for it unless you are a hardcore fan of moto.	2
9740	Good value for money phone	4
9741	Overall this is the best mobile i had found in this budget,just got this from amazon and using ,everything is working excellent even the remote got connected to setup box	5
9742	I just have been mindblown by this LG Q6 after the use of 3 months.This is not a sophisticated specification mobile but It does what is promised to the customer greatly.Also, The deal I got is never ever I have experienced with any online shopping, Thank you Amazon.The performance is superb for the daily normal usage and handle more application without any hanging.Except for Selfie which is good at the daylight, The others are very positive including customer support.	4
9743	Overall I am happy the loud speaker could have been a bit more loud.	5

9750	Good product in this price range.	5
9751	Battery,display and performance superrrrr	5
9752	This phone is nice in design, Apps and camera. The performance is bit less.. It strucks some time when you wanted to transfer photos through Bluetooth.. It strucks when you open Google photos app..need to work on this... I guess vlc player is not there for this phone as the reviews are too bad... Fingerprint sensor is very good.. Face recognition is good... Need to work out on this a little bit to unlock through face during night.. Need a software upgrade to put the screen on while reading... Or should be like face turn out or into the screen..	4
9753	The allover experience is really good. Bang for buck.	5
9754	Hanging problem	1
9755	Nice looking and best performance... Thanks honor and thanks also Flipkart	5
9756	Trust me it has the best camera and the worst battery.Not recommended for heavy and moderate users.If camera is your ultimate priority then you may go for it.	3
9757	Redmi 6 pro mobile is very nice	5
9758	"Bought this product on freedom sale thanks amazon for great discount I had bought this item on approx 16000 very gud performance... Very gud battery life picture quality is also a gud... Overall very satisfy with this product!!One line for amazon ""Yaha dikhata hi nahi hai milta bhi hai boss"""	5
9759	Worst camera. It's not a good mobile for camera lovers. Better to for redmi note 5 pro which is better than 6 pro in terms of picture quality, software and Processor.Display notch is not that attractive. You can disable it though.Mobile is handy, fast and  battery backup is good and but still camera sucks(front/rear)It has shown returnable at the time of booking. After talking to customer care they say there is No return policy for mobiles and tablets.Only replacement if any issues.Think before you purchase.	1
9760	Picture quality not good	2
9761	This phone only for normal user not heavy users, price high and value is low overall phone is balance.	4

9767	Picture quality is excellent, but battery  life is very poor	4
9768	one speaker only works	4
9769	As per my usage for 1 day I say this is an awesome product by Moto. I have battery charged so quick and even with lot of usage the device after running for 12 hrs straight, my charge is at 50%. Fast charging using turbo charger. Performance is good. slight lag is there sometimes. It is heavier because of battery. camera is good but still I need to explore more. But as per my usage till now it is a very good and cheap phone currently.READ MORE	5
9770	Everything is perfect but don't go for it if you want a phone with a good battery life...the battery is life is worst and doesn't lasts for more than 1 hour. Camera is awesome.Stock Android and Display makes the phone more better. But it could be a perfect one if it had a good battery life.	3
9771	Nice picture quality. Good sound and bettery life.	5
9772	Good mobile in this rate	4
9773	Picture quality sucks . 6x or 7x was better.Battery life is very good even you play PUBG for quite a few times.Comes with a convenient transparent back cover.Multitasking is good.Duals voLTE slot is a saviour. You get 4G in both slots and it helps when your first connection is poor in places .	4

9833	I have used this phone from last week and loving it day by day. Not love at first sight.It's so slim(slimmer than S8) and body is metal and front is Gorilla glass screen. Thanks to Cover which came with it.What you will love or this phone is worth for:-☆☆☆☆☆☆Camera- too good pics, check attached ones.☆OS- Stack android (Upgradeable to PIE soon)☆Body(feels premium)☆Screen good for watching videos.☆Battery working good till- full one day.☆OIS at 1080P video.What phone lacks:☹☹☹☹NO Face Unlock☹ No Optical Zoom☹ NO Optical Image Stabilization at 4k Video☹ Screen, it's hard to see in sunshine even its on full brightness☹FM radio☹3.5mm jack (you will get a connector for 3.5mm jack in box)☹No micro sd slot(dual sim only)Verdict:☆☆☆☆☆The camera is awesome, Sony lenses. Focusing is fast and accurate.Low light camera works great. This phone is the selfie king.Camera + stack android is just wow, go for it guys.Give me a thumbs up and ask questions in the comment section.	5
9834	Picture quality isn't Good..waste phone	2
9835	Except for the loudspeaker volume being a little low, everything about the phone is drool worthy. Amazon had a great scheme for exchange, hence bought 2 in lieu of my old lumia 630. (3500/- return value per phone)Build quality and 18:9 aspect ratio is the USP of this phone.	5

9920	A perfect phone you need	5
9921	The best thing about purchasing this cellphone from Amazon is that it was delivered in less than 24 hours.The performance of the phone goes beyond words, even after installing a few games. The battery life lasts almost 1.5 days under normal usage (4G + Bluetooth  switched on). The design is almost similar to that of iPhone X. The same feedback applies to the camera as well.The only issue I found with this phone is with the IR blaster. I tried pairing the phone to almost 4 ACs and one TV, but none of the devices responded.	5
9922	Over all good performanceAverage phoneBudget oriented	4
9923	Great, outstanding	4
9924	Product battery backup is not good	5

9927	While calling from jio sim there is no option of video calling. It's really disappointed for me. And also while unboxing I did not find back cover and provided very poor quality of headphone. Transparent l Back cover should be provided. It's not wealth of 20k.	1
9928	I have used MI A1 but this time MI has really disappointed in terms of price, battery and hardware's.Battery draining in 2~3 hrsNo headphone jackHigh pricingFace lock open not up to mark as per price.I will not recommend this product to anyone..	3
9929	Have still NOT Received the refund which you initiated on 25th June against the return of this product. Request please check and do the needful.> Seems That Nokia is selling Inferior quality products in India.> FM Radio not working in low frequency areas where as other branded phones easily catch FM frequency> Picture stabilisation feature is absent and causes NOISE in picture quality and hence clarity becomes absent> Audio Quality in Receiver and speaker is pathetic as output is not of Nokia standards at allVery dismal Product	1
9930	Camera is not as per the sample picture shown in the site. However a good phone in this range	5
9931	Good woth battry backup	5
9932	Thumbs up for 18:9 display, and tough rim, dedicated microSD slot! 🔥Performance average, no issues for normal user!Would have liked a more powerful SoC, bigger battery, USB Type-C!Not for gamers, and don't use Hotspot for long time!	4
9933	This is an awesome phone!!  It is so SLIM.Battery:You need to understand this, that your phone needs a or two to fully set itself up. There is a lot which goes on in the background for setting the phone up as per your liking.I have location (Battery Saver) enabled for 'Find my Device' and adaptive brightness and partly on Wifi but majority of the time on Mobile Data for day-to-day usage.It easily last me 1.5 days to at times close to 2 days.  I think since we depend a lot on smartphones now-a-days, 1 day should be enough.I have attached screen shots for you to see the battery endurance.Proximity Sensor:Honestly, I've not faced any proximity issues. It works fine for me.3.5mm Headphone slot:I'm very upset about the fact that people rate low JUST coz this phone does not have a 3.5mm jack.This is mentioned EVERYWHERE!!!!!  Still if you buy it and say you didn't read it anywhere, that's your fault not the phones.The world is moving to complete digital signals and wireless.  However, Mi has provided a dongle for you to use it along with your headphones. I've never bothered removing my headphones from the dongle. It's like my headphones are by default Type-C instead of 3.5mm.If you are soo much addicted to using headphones even while charging you have zillions of other option.Sound Quality:This phone is loud!Wouldn't say its clear when full but definitely loud.  Even with the dongle, the sound quality does not drop.I'm an audiophile, I've bought music player worth a lot to have a great audio experience.  Trust me, this does the work.Camera:Need I comment on this? ;)It's brilliant!!Qualcomm SDM660 Snapdragon 660:Excellent CPU. Blazing fast speed.Overall, I'm highly content with this phone.  The price you are getting it, it's AMAZING!!  At the price I got it with exchange and offers, it's a steal deal.Realme 2 Pro may be a competitor coz of UFS 2.1 Storage but A2 has Type-C slot and Corning Gorilla Glass 5,  better Camera quality and Android One which gives it an upper hand.	5
9934	Amazing phone at this price..	5
9935	Best in this price range.. Don't waste your time to look for any better device in this price range because you won't get any.. After a detailed research of 2 weeks I have bought it.	5

9944	camera quality nice...Looks beautiful.. preferences good	5
9945	Product design is awesome and functions like Redmi note 5 pro	4
9946	Pros:Compact and lightweight, makes it handy.Good battery life.Full charge easily lasts 1.5 days, can stretch to 2 days on decent use.Portrait photos are good.No lags, seamless performance.Cons:Front camera could have been better.Micro usb charging port, they should have migrated to type C.Screen is not too bright.	5
9947	Good display but it doesn't contain a gorilla glass, with the usage of 3 days found many scratches on the display screen.Battery drains soo quick.Very limited service centers. Even LG team doesn't aware of that which glass contains on this phone.	1
9948	The overall phone is good, sound quality is also nice. affordable, stock android , processor speed is good, type 'c' charger are good features.But, I really hate this phone as1. you can either charge the phone or listen the songs as same port is used for both... If your phone is drained out and you want to call someone.... you can't charge a phone and have a call together or listen songs during charging2. AI selfie camera actually nothing but like beatification tools.3. 20 Mega pixel camera is just a word and picture quality is poor	3
9949	It takes time to capture picture . Rest everything is upto the mark	4
9950	Super smart	5
9951	value for money.....	4
9952	Nothing new in this phone. It is an upgraded version of redmi4 with notch display additionally. That's why maximum offers are available for this model. Heavy weight, poor camera quality.	2
9953	Nice phone for the range of 15k	5
9954	Received the product on time in good condition. Issues I faced: 1. Sleep mode doesn't work. 2. Network doesn't work properly. Because of this problem, I moved the SIM to another old phone, which works better than Mi A2.	1
9955	In short we call it small DSLR	5
9956	All over good phone	4
9957	Very nice phone. Lg rocks. Go for it if you prefer user intetface over features. Display of this phone is bestest	5
9958	Thank you amazon this phone I am very licked, super phone,very good product.	5
9959	Superbbbbbbbb	5
9960	I liked the design, has less bazels,Hate the launcher and skin, user interface,  doest feels premium.And about the processor,, it is decent, but not so amazing, cannot Handel heavy loads,It doesn't supports Google latest GCAM apk port, it supports the old Gcam apk which doesn't have hdr+ enhanced mode, no night sight, only lens blue is available.  And i hated this.Front camera it's very good, for this price, it offers great quality selfies and the back camera is also good, but Video recording is very average, you won't get EIS or OIS,..And no usb type C port, it offers micro usb port,Display is quite good, but it is not comparable with AMOLED and OLED displays, they are just amazing, And the midst important part, it doesn't provides CORNING GORILLA GLASS PROTECTION,Over all, this phone is ok for the price,.  But I think Asus ZenFone Mac Pro m2 is a littelbit better choise, because of the big battery, stock launcher, user interface, CORNING GORILLA GLASS 6 protection, and It will support Google's latest GCAM with night shift and good portraits after enabling the CAMERA 2API,	5
9961	Too Many limitations.	2
9962	REALLY I DISAPPOINTED POOR DISPLAY QUALITY. DONT BUY HONOR 8X GO HONOR 9N OVERALL ITS BETTER COMPARE PRICE ALSO	3
9963	I loved d phone. Itz a very good product in this price range.. Loved d camera quality, d facilities available in this, fast to run..Battery life is quite less.. Nt good for gaming much.. It will consume more of battery.. Overall phone is very good..U may  Go for it...☺	5
9964	A good product for the budget. Worth. But MI all models has more radiation which affect us. If u speak for 10 min on call..ur ears got pain.	3
9965	Not much gud	3
9966	The product is fine, with notch display, but there is unnecessary blackened area, as shown in the picture. Otherwise, nearly 1 week of use, and all's good. The battery life is standard. With full day data on, it runs for about 24 hours. The speakers are at it's best, sound is so loud that it can be heard from next room(unlike Redmi 3S, in which I have to take the speaker close to my ears to hear what exactly the sound is). Now, only time will speak of it's quality.	5

10002	Update after using for 12 days:No changes to my original review - nothing has changed in the phone. I did some more customizations and my liking towards this phone has only increased. Only drawback is keeping speaker at the back. Without our knowledge our fingers can cover the speaker.Original Review:Writing this review after 4 days of usage (actually two days use and two days standby: day 1 - getting a feel of the phone, navigating here and there, installing apps and customizing phone for my liking. General messaging through whatsapp - in total, 2 to 3 hours. Day 2 and 3 - standby. Day 4 - more customization, wifi on for 8 hours, messaging, watching videos for 2 hours, using google assistant, taking photos, and some more activities)Note: when i received phone, the battery had 80% power. I kept it for charging until it reached 100%. Then unplugged it. Now while writing this review the charge stands at 10%.People complaining about things that are missing : fingerprint sensor, lesser battery power, plastic back, etc etc. Wont you guys read the specs before buying. With so much information available at our dispose, we should make use of it to decide.Coming to phone: its good phone in the given price range. The driving force for me to buy this phone was - once i was owning nexus 4 which was manufactured by LG.Heating issues: to be frank, i did not experience any heating issues so far. There are different photo sizes available. When i was using 4:3 (13MP), i did feel little warm near volume buttons. Later i tried all other photo size options. I did not feel warm/hot. Overall there is no heat issue in the piece that i have received.Battery Management: IMHO, the battery management is very very relative. As in - It all depends on how we are using our phone. It can not be a generic statement unless there is some flaw in the design and manufacturing.As i mentioned before, i recharged battery on day one and till now it has not drained completely.Tip: if this is going to help - do not overcharge battery and do not charge frequently. I received this advice from a Dell Professional - charge your battery until it reaches 100% and then unplug it. Keep it for charging again when the level drops to less than 10%. I follow this for all my devices - macbook pro, iphone, kindle, samsung tablet, Bose soundlink, and etc..One thing that i did not like is the default Home screen option. In this, if we have to remove app shortcuts, we have to go to settings and home screen and hide apps. This is not at all user friendly. To overcome this I installed LG Home and App drawer. This is good and it suits my needs. If you are a user who doesn't like cluttered home screen, then you should use different home drawer.	5

10021	Review after 10 days of use:Build Quality : SuperbLook and Feel: Very NiceUI: Fast and FluidPerformance : SnappyDisplay: Best in class. Quality of display is class above. No one can come even closer.Sound: Main speaker seems good but output through headphone jack could have been better. Using SkullCandy earphones.Camera: Not a camera guy but it feels like details in images could have been better.Software updates: Can't say about updates but do not expect frequent software updates.Overall a very considerable smartphone in this price range. No one can go wrong in buying this smartphone over others.If you still have any doubt, ask me here. I would love to help you out.Peace.	5
10022	Stock android experience is very bad	3
10023	Not bettry life goodMi a1 good performanceNot happy this phone	3
10024	Very slim and looks good. Only drawback is that there is no headphone jack but since I hardly use earphones it doesn't affect me much.	5
10025	This is my first LG mobile phone and I must admit I am far from happy.Pros:1) Looks: It is a good looking phone indeed - small and slim - one you wouldn't mind flaunting.2) Screen: The full vision screen is good, if not excellent.3) Ergonomics: Having a small footprint it is good for one handed operations. In these times of big screens and fat phones, the Q6 comes as a welcome relief and yet gives you the large screen experience.4) The one time free screen replacement offer: it saved me.Cons:1) The biggest disappointment is the Call and Contacts application. Both hang and are extremely frustrating. When you are looking to make a call and taps on a contact or number, it takes a long time to start dialing, if at all it works. Often I have got surprised when the call suddenly starts 2-3 mins after I gave up trying to call! Any other app hanging is understandable.. but call n contacts application hanging?? .. not acceptable at all..The man at the DSC told me that this problem can we fixed by clearing call logs! Am yet to try..2) Fagile Screen:The Q6 screen is a bit curved if you notice carefully. The tempered glass therefore doesn't fix properly to the Q6 screen. Remember that the package includes a tempered glass. The edges just don't stick! Yet I had kept one. For me, the phone dropped from approx. 1 foot height and everything shattered - tempered glass and the touch screen! It was a mild fall which many phones would have come out unscathed, but not the Q6.3) Battery: This one has a poor battery.. needs charging 2/3 times daily, for me.4) Back cover: It has a cheap plastic back cover which is completely at odds with the overall well designed product. It's a finger print magnet too... In a month your back cover would look a year old!5) unlock: Q6 doesn't come with a finger print scanner. The alternate Face unlock isn't great.. you need ample light and works at 50% accuracy at best..6) Software tuning: Improvement needed.7) Resale: After just 3 months, Amazon was offering me just a paltry INR 1,500 on exchange with a new phone! Remember this costs 15k to buy.I usually change phones every half year or so and I can't see myself picking up another LG! Overall it is a disappointing package.	2

10061	About the phone:Android Version:*Android v8.1 (Oreo) based on MIUIPerformance*Snapdragon 625 battery efficient*Octa Core, 2 GHz processor*4GB RAM enough for daily useDisplay*5.84 inches (14.83 cm)*1080x2280 px, 432 PPI crisp display*IPS LCD beautiful colourCamera*12 MP + 5 MP Dual Primary Cameras*LED Flash*5 MP Front CameraBattery*4000 mAh 1 day+ battery life*Non-Removable*4G Supports Indian bands*VoLTE*64 GB + 256 GB Expandable*Dual SIM: Nano + Nano*Dedicated Micro SD Slot*Fingerprint sensor*USB OTG SupportReview:Overall the phone feels bit heavy given the small form factor, which indeed feels good in hand. Camera performance is average. Processor SD 625 is aged not the latest (but still good). Battery life is sufficient. SIM ejector pin is too small may get lost (careful!). Has got a notification LED on bottom. Has most of the decent sensors (Compass, Step, Gyro etc.). Has IR Blaster.The phone looks identical to other Redmi phones. The display is the main attraction.Overall performance is average, don't expect huge from this phone at this price segment. Good for average user.	4

10109	Heating issue in my lg q6 in black colour...... Its to hot during use...	2
10110	It is super but front camera should have been given more.	5
10111	Phone screen gets black whenever I do calling.. also many times not able to listen and transmit the voices.edit: problem got sorted after a reboot. didn't happed again till now. so changing my rating from 1* to 3*	3
10112	Package was delivered within 48 hours of purchase. The phone handles very smoothly and is surprisingly light due to the aluminium body. Android One is a brilliant collaborative effort between Google and certain smartphone brands including Nokia and it delivers on all points. OS is Oreo 8.1 and works super smooth with zero lag. No unnecessary apps by manufacturer, so there's approx 46 GB free space available after all Google LLC system apps are updated and installed. The fingerprint sensor is accurate with no lag time. Battery life is average with approx. 60 hours standby for my usage. There was an issue with overheating initially when charging. Am not yet aware of what measures are to be taken regarding this issue, however, funnily enough the overheating stopped when I charged the phone for 20 mins using my battery pack and then shifted to actual charger. Eh, whatever works. Front camera takes decent selfies with good facial clarity. Rear camera is 16 megapixels powered by Zeiss optics and that's evident with picture detailing and sharpness. For the price range, the specs of this phone are very robust and you can understand that the manufacturers have made it to last for long term usage. Anyone who likes to buy a phone for hardy usage lasting at least 3-4 years, this one's perfect for you.Picture was taken in auto mode with no filters.	5
10113	Not good cemra	5

10119	Everything I liked so I bought	5
10120	Phone damn sexy, I got in superb exchange offer and totally in love with this device, this phone have dedicated memory card slot, no hybrid crap if you want a good device go for it. 15k for reliable branded device go for it.Amazon delivery really sucks they delayed delivery of this phone 2 days even I ordered with prime but 5 starts for the phone	5
10121	Amazing  fone	4
10122	LG Q6 It's a fantastic phone and full vision video experience full handy use I like its LG Q6 ...	5
10123	My phone receiver sound is very low .When I call or receive a call during conversation very low sound level very difficult to hear the voice.	1

10125	Like the mobile	4
10126	Stylish and sleek	5
10127	The phone looks good and has a pretty good build quality. Has two bottom firing speakers and still has 3.5 mm jackScreen is full HD but is IPS LCD but has good viewing angles and yes the notchThe vibration (haptic feedback ) is pretty average in my opinionAlso the placing of led notification light is not pleasantcall quality and speakers quality seemed good.people usuing JIO 4G should know that Volte will only work if the default data connection is set to JIOcamera at least for me it was the major disappointment  below average camera performance . there is no point in providing 2 cameras. It doesn't add anything but the Bokeh effect.keeping that in mind daylight performance on whole could be said as passablefingerprint scanner and face unlock works finebattery is of 4000 mahcapacity  ( charging time is around 2.5 hours). for moderate users battery may last for 2 - 3 daysEven though it's claimed to support fast charging , Xiaomi supplies their normal 5 V ,2 amps chargerI bought this phone as an exchange to redmi 2 prime which was given 2700Rs as an offer.after bank discount i paid around 7500 rs and for that price i would say this phone is stellarOverall performance is snappy and so is the software.may be camera performance can be improved with software updatesOverall rating is 7/10	3
10128	Poor picture quality	2
10129	There are some slow down issues in this phone right out of the box.... I guess update to MIUI 10 would solve it.... The screen size i very good..... Overall good phone	4

10160	Product was awesome. But after sometime it becomes slow in performance	4
10161	Good Mobile who loves camera picture quality. After Android 9 updates, feels awesome. Nevigation is fast due to stock Android. Battery life is slight lower but it doesn't matter who carry charger/power bank with him. MI manufactured beautiful mobile.	5
10162	Best Phone in this price !!!!!	5
10163	Last phone redmi note 4, I am enjoying using this gorgeous and very cute device, it's a great feel to be able to use your phone again with one hand. Ability expand notification and reply or delete right from notification is great , its not clunked up with xiaomi unnecessary features , but have all the vanilla features of 7.1.1Tips1) go to settings and scan your face 3-4 times every time it cant recognise you in same lightning condition and it will be become almost flawless.2) if app is not supporting resolution (yet to find even single app myself) , set your preffred resolution in settings	5
10164	As expected MI 6 Pro is upbeatable	5
10165	Worest product dont buy	1

10172	Camera very nice,full touch,but battry power low	1
10173	Battery stands for one day with full time mobile data ON and moderate usage of apps.Camera quality is not that good.Smooth navigation.Only generic Google apps are available. MI users won't be happy with this since MI phones had built-in apps for almost all purposes. Not even Gallery app is available.Facebook and Instagram videos are blurry ,while YouTube and Amazon prime videos play with full HD quality. Seems to be an issue.	3
10174	Picture quality good , sound clear, battery backup excellent	4
10175	Pro:1. Awesome screen.2. Best MiUi interface.3. Sturdy product.4. Good photos for this budget.5. Best in class battery life.Cons:1. Camera could have been better.Been using it for 4 days now, So far so good. Will post another update later.	5

10177	Everything in this mobile is perfect. However, the camera can be made better. Good, trustworthy and sensible choice if you select this device. I liked this device very much. It looks very rich. Performance is best. No issue with this phone. Battery and notch are excellent. A good budget phone. Go for it.	5
10178	Phone doesn't support many apps. Processor is not up to the mark. It's quite slower than its rivals. But on the other hand it gives premium touch with awesome looks.	3
10179	Suparb products	5
10180	Everything fine about this product... But my  disappoint is that it doesn't have a jack pin... And it doesn't have separate SIM tray... You can't use an external memory	3
10181	Value for money. Good buy	5
10182	Picture quality Sound quality and Battery life is good	5
10183	On first day .Average phonecamera not very impressiveNo new features.Heats up littleSize seems smaller than other 5.5 screen phone.No charging notification.(really bad)Only good thing was Amazon exchange a best deal for this product.Now after 2 days use, i have difference in my own opinion and given 4 starPhone build up is solid,display is excellent,Battery life is for one day.Less heat.Looks to be the best phone in this range.	4

10267	Battery life is very poor. You can get a much better deal for this price.	2
10268	I got the product today , 6.5 inch screen with slim design and battery back up  I Love it , thanks Honor ,  I am waiting for next 9.1 updating  guys go for it , amazing product for this price at this moment .	5
10269	OK on budget	4
10270	The mobile is good but better options are available. The battery should be atleast 3500 MAH and the camera is also not up to the mark.	4
10271	The phone is decent, although it should have had more wider design for media usage,Overall is a good buy, but do compare for better alternatives.	4
10272	Premium look awesome design but conditions applyMobile is good nly for external and  too bad when comes to internal performance, battery camera too avg 20k it's a big for thz it's better to go with honor play	2
10273	1. All is talking about display but the display is not as much impressive as expected2. Average rear camera coz of its focal length and colour tone, worst front camera3. Bad speaker4. Mobile heating issue only first time while setting up google accountBest mobile under this price range..  :)	4
10274	Greay	5
10275	Don’t bother about unnecessarily negativity built around a very good mobile for the bucks so go for it if wanted.Everybody knows that it has -1. Stunning camera with great hardware and very optimized software.2. Android One – Pure and snappy android with future upgrades for two years3. Great performance  - Impressive hardware, Snapdragon 660 is a decent processor4. Sleek and slimSome cons though can be mitigated –1. No headphone jack – Not a big deal as I kept provided adapter attached to my wired headphones/wireless BT in future can be used2. Average battery – I like gaming but not a heavy gamer and not a sales person on the go, so can be manage and anyway fast charge 4 support provided.3. No Micros SD slot – Who cares when Android one provided unlimited cloud storage. 64 GB seems sufficient in case.	5
10276	face lock not working always ... waste of money ...	2
10277	Battery life is ok. Sound quality is awesome, but picture quality is not so good.	4

10298	Overall a fantastic phone, the build quality is great and holding the phone in your hands, feels like a premium phone.	5
10299	A total value for money	5
10300	Value Money product. Nicejust quite heavy due to 4k MAH battery	4
10301	Handset is having couple of problems like software update problem, sound problem, signal strength and much more. Inspite of raising complaints no resolution. Have been a loyal customer of amazon from a decade but after facing this have to re think.	1
10302	It's very nice phoneI m satisfied with this phone	5
10303	This phone behaves itself. The notification tones will switch off itself. Battery is really bad. Camera is OK. Absence of head phone jack gives space for dual speakers due to which sound is too much, really not required. Got this one after hearing the success of Mi A1, but not satisfied.	2
10304	Nice product, quick charging and no heating problem.	5
10305	Satisfied with this phone best in class in this budget	5
10306	Stongally recommend	5
10307	Good looks with Gazab ka performance	5
10308	Not a good phone in this rangeBattery life sucksHeating issuesLagging problem tooCamera quality not too good as shownLow light camera performance was too poorUnnecessary adds by google provided as pop ups , its too disturbing	3
10309	good but not excellent	2
10310	Snapdragon 660 processor is awesome and makes all the apps work smoothly.Android one program is giving quicker updates.Other than avg battery everything else is superb in this phone.	5
10311	Like:Sound qualityBattery lifeCamera can be built more better	4
10312	Phone is not that much worth for the amount better go for motog2 is best compared to this	1
10313	So Far its good	4
10314	Delivery was prompt, received it in 24 hours. Good phone. Notch doesn't work while playing videos, watching YouTube, playing games. So people who are buying it for notch, ignore this phone or until XIAOMI comes with an update. Bought RED colour, it doesn't look RED, looks like MAROON or PINK, not happy with colour. If you want to buy go for BLACK or GOLD. Overall it is a nice budget phone. GOOD JOB XIAOMI.	4
10315	I'm Very much Happy with The Product and Delivery was also Very Fast	5
10316	Good phone for low to medium users. It works well for basic tasks like social media and basic apps. If you are looking for great performance this is not your cup of tea. There is a little bit of lag in the UI. The camera needs improvement. I hope LG will push an update for this. The screen is really good you will love it. The battery is average and it will not last a full day of usage with multi tasking. The back attracts scratches and you will need a case or cover. There is a bit of heating issue on the back and the sides during multi tasking especially during syncing. I would have been really happy if they have included fast charging and a higher processor. Finger print scanner is missing - but I am ok with this provided the privacy and security issues. Face unlocking is there but it only works if you hold your phone properly against your  face with good lighting.SummaryPros:ScreenLess blot-waresFront CamMetal frameConsMediocre  processerAverage back camPlastic backNo fingerprint scanner	3
10317	Good.It may known when it start to run min.6month	4
10318	Perfect!!! Another Cool Mobile from LG	5
10319	Price is too high	4

10321	They r using a 2yr old processor, just eyewash notch ph, don't buy	3
10322	Awesome phone!!!	4
10323	Usiing this for two months and literally its working very fine, better than any phone at this price	5
10324	Not a good product , have ordered another note 5 pro 6 GB	3
10325	Good Product, features, look and performance at par with 1+ series	5
10326	Worst piece with no special features waste of money ,worst camera	2
10327	Great budget phone....you will love the amazing body structure.....looks premium.....the screen is the best feature of this mobile	5
10328	First let me talk about the PROS1: Build quality- it is sheer delight holding this device, the glass back looks and feels so premium without knowing which phone this is nobody can even imagine that this costsjust 15k from Redmi note 6 pro ( not a typo it will launch this month) to MI A2 as well as Realme2 pro no phone can match the look and feel of this device2: Display- GORGEOUS nothing else to say3: Camera- Dont understand why a few people are bashing the camera on this, yes it lacks EIS but that can be fixed via an OTA, for photography this is no DSLR and no other phone even twice its price is. For the price this phone does its job. Nobody will tell you that the picture lacks in quality.CONS4: EMUI- UI is a matter of preference few people are complaining about occasional lagging of the phone and they are not wrong. Sometimes the UI lags although its minor but yes a bit disappointed on that.Audio:. This is the biggest con for me. The speakers are average but the output from Audio jack is POOR many a times I end up clicking the volume button in hopes that the volume would further increase. You would feel that your Sony extra bass headphones have become useless all of a sudden because the volume is so less that the bass never hits your brain.	5
10329	Mia2 is good but poor battery	3
10330	Product is good and satisfy with the service.	5
10331	I loved it. It has everything what I wanted n I got it in 7k with an exchange offer with my old mobile. Brilliant offer.	5
10332	Camera colour is not natural	5
10333	Five star	4
10334	I love amezonGood packingGood productCamera battry good	5
10335	Very good fone for selfie and DSLR loversBattery is very good and also dual LTE .	5

10341	Battery is draining as compared to other mi mobiles . Everything else is cool	5
10342	Display is awesome.. Display Looks like 20k plus mobile... Front and back camera is also good at this price range... Phone never lags for normar daily usage... Battery comes easily 1 day... .Only cons of this phone is - No fingerprint sensor...	5
10343	Best phone for the people who are looking for a phone within the cost of 15000/-.	5
10344	Love love love	5
10345	Value for money!	5
10346	Waste Google os	2
10347	Not satisfied my expectations	3
10348	No battery life as mention. Its not even work for full day Not happy with purchase Phone is not working properly This was my first purchase from Amazon. Bad experience	1
10349	Huawei team, rear camera quality to be increased with good picture clarity....	5
10350	Very nice product..	3
10351	Unexpectedly surprising!	5
10352	Not working charging board..  Poor battery life.Poor amazon work.	1

10354	Phone is hanged..... Sound quality very bad	1
10355	Chutiya phone	1
10356	Battery life very poor.. automatically discharged	3
10357	Bought the phone. Here is my experience.Pro's1. Display is good2 . No lag in day to day operations3.UI is new I liked it.4.bright displayCons1.bad camera2. Screen colour reproduction is not great ( red, green ,blue ).3. Heating problem4. Back of the phone is the worst you (mine is platinum and is worst).	4
10358	FOR THE BATTLE OF MID RANGE SEGMENT PHONE IT IS CLEARLY A WINNER	5
10359	Mobile founded problem while listening, need to on speaker, also download the app, though founded the same problem,had asked for replacement.	1
10360	Very nice phone at this price range.Highly recommendable.READ MORE	5
10361	Overall Nice and good phone	5
10362	O ok	5
10363	Full vision display is very good. Best compact phone ever use before with big display. awesome selfie camera with wide angle. Best phone at this price.	5
10364	Overall quality and look is good enough to feel like a premium phone. The battery is good for a day in normal usage. Continuous access of online videos and games will result in a heating problem. Front camera could have been much better in same price package.  Image quality is good in daylighting but it will disappoint you in low light . Overall 3.5 out of 5.	3
10365	Display, battery backup, camears  are all good but size is not satisfactory.... Realme 2 is far better than it....	4
10366	Go for it. It looks and features are just awesome. It can compete premium mobile phones.Really impressed with the honor.Video quality is not very good.	5
10367	Very annoying	1
10368	After 2 months of full use, the mentioned points are to be noted :Picture and sound quality is good.Automatic brightness is not there you have to manually set it up all time.Processor is good and working fine.Hangs very rarelyBattery is worst among all Samsung brand, it drained within 2 to 3 hrs of full useSo before purchasing the product you can check other products available in market with good battery life and more featuresOreo is not yet updated.	4
10369	phone is noy good productREAD MORE	1
10370	I've been using mi A1 from last year. That phone was really killer in the segment. Now Xiaomi has released the A2, the successor, and it's been a week and I still feel that yes it's really better than A1 and most importantly still the best in segment. However there are few things which I hate that is no headphone jack and small battery. I don't mind if my phone is a bit thicker if it has these features. Although Mi A2 has a better camera than Realme 2 Pro, RN 5 Pro and is very similar to Honor Play and Poco F1. Performance wise you get Snap 660 and it performs like a charm. Display quality is not the best but very clear and sharp. Most importantly, it has a gorilla glass 5 which is definitely a big plus point.	5
10371	Good Looking Phone... Camera is Quite ok.. Average Specs..	4
10372	Small mobile but nice looking	5
10373	Best mobile camera below 20kGood Android one experience	5
10374	The phone heats up after 10 minutes of usage causing the touch to work automatically or not working at all. Many a time phone becomes unresponsive without using it (Idle screen). It had the issues since the first day I received it.I can see many users have complained similar issues which clearly shows that this particular model has build quality issues.I returned the phone.	1
10375	I bought this for my brother. As of now I couldn't find any disadvantages on this mobile. Some people may say this is little bulky. Yes it is. But I couldn't find it as a prblm. Bcoz it easily fit on my hand and pockets (in both matter(size & money☺️)). First of all I want to say u say, u can't get a dslr like picture with ur mobile which priced under ₹25,000/-. We should look for the mobile which could give u a better performance, bathery backup, handy....etc. Some people would say that the processor is outdated! That is ridiculous! Bcoz those people who hv been using 'redmi note 4' and other mobiles which powered by SD 625 wouldn't give u any shit on the performance of their gadget. Here's also I could feel the same thing. U can throw any damn things to it, it executes all them very smoothly!!I really love redmi products. My wife and I hv been using redmi note 4 for last 1 and half years. Recently I bought a Redmi TV too. TV is also working very smoothly!!☺️👍👍 thanks redmi team.. i Love U..The above said things are my personal experiences. I'm not promoting redmi company.	4
10376	Over all it's a good buy, apart from the music output in headphones. Great battery life, speed is very good for a 4gb ram. Water resistant as I tested it 2-3 times. Prepare your mind for the standard UI of Android as it doesn't allow you to customize.	4
10377	This product is very low qualityIt's not good please update version MIUI10	4
10378	This has been a fait deal. I wanted it before my birthday and exactly on the day it was delivered perfect cell in 11k range but I got it in exchange with my old 3S so it was a double gift for me ...Everything from sound quality to battery life and function all are good. I love Xiomi.	5
10379	I purchase a phone MI A2. It's not working fine. sansor is not working. Face unlock feature is not working...	1
10380	Front camera OKBack camera not goodNot Worth for money	3
10381	"Well, This review is after 4 Days of Usage.**First of all, I would say my whole family is Honor bound since it's Launch. We've been using Honor 2, Honor Holly, Honor Bee, Honor 6x & now Honor 8x.** Why Honor phones throughout?  - Still our first phone Honor 2 is working and it's been nearly 6.5 years. So that should suffice I guess.**And Why Honor 8x and not any other phone in the market (Oppo F9 Pro / Vivo V11 / Realme 2 Pro / POCO etc.)  - 1. Trust & Brand of Huawei - Most of the above mentioned names are new entrants in the Telecom industry & Huawei has been there for nearly 4+ decades  - 2. Pricing for the 6GB Variant (My budget was always 15k-17k; Nowadays, Mobilephone market functions like a Use & Throw - The Sellers are keeping us occupied with added features in every launch - almost like every month - So always a budget performer with reliable quality gets a thumbs up from me)  - 3. Looks & Durability of Honor 8x when compared to the other models mentioned above.**How is the performance ?- UI - (5/5) EMUI is one of the best UIs available in the market next to the iPhones. I bet you no other phones has a better UI on offer other than Honor - Be it (ColorOS from OPPO / JOVI AI Asst. -Vivo / MIUI - of Xiaomi )  - CAMERA -  This is where I feel 8x is a bit let down. Yes! The Selfie cam is not at par with Oppo F9 Pro but comparing a 25MP Cam variant with 16 MP would just be a sin + Add 10k extra price to that of Oppo F9 Pro.  But still, Huawei could have bumped up the Selfie Cam to 20/25 MP for an extra price of 2k.-- 20 MP AI Dual Camera is just a pure delight ! Corner/Edge Correction is good & Bokeh is okayish.Night Mode is very good for the 20MP AI Camera the Huawei has offered. So that kind of equalizes the low of front cam !(*I would any day switch my Honor 6x cam for this 8x)Hence:  3/5  - USAGE & ISSUES -  - This is the part I love with Huawei (Their Own KIRIN Processors) - Absolutely no problems in switching between the apps, Works like a swish ! (*Better than the Snapdragons available in market*)  - No Heating issues on playing games for at the least 45-50 min continuously (*Only my hands get numb -lol*)  - Huawei Cloud Storage is a smart feature to have.  - Fingerprint is 5/5 any day.  - Face Unlock : 4/5So on Usage + Processor - 5/5 for all the loaded features it comes with for a price @ 16k. - Just unbelievable.  - CHARGING - (4/5)  *No fast charging but it takes 2 hours to charge from 2% to 85% (*Impressive according o me)  - SPEAKERS - (4.5/5)  Honor has finally listened to it's subscribers Honor 6x, 7x 7c, Play all lacked a bit in Speakers output & Wow, they have increased the output considerably in this one. So a big Thanks! (*Without compromising on the quality)So OVERALL -(4/5)After my usage I would definitely recommend this phone for people who are budget oriented (like me) but at the same time want a Trustable brand + 6 Gigs of RAM - I bet there is no other phone available to swoop other than this HONOR 8X.Yes, Front Cam is a big let down, so for the ones who say, ""Boss! I am gonna keep showing my face 24*7 infront of my mobile and keep showing that to my followers across the globe & I can shell out 10-15k extra for the same"" - Then this is definitely not your cup of tea !"	4
10382	Asw phone in this price range	5
10383	Don't know whats the problem with your phone  it has two dots on the screen or dust I can't tell	2
10384	Camera is not that good as claimed by the company.Hope some bugs will be fixed after few updates	3
10385	Very good product; thanks to amazon including this LG Q6; i strongly recommend to buy this phone	5
10386	I didnt received proper billing of my phone. what i received a inked paper which is nt printed even properly.plz issued me a proper bill of my purchased.	4
10387	Nice picture and Amazon pakage was so good. Amazon is best of buying the product	5
10388	Pros- Good design- decent camera- decent battery backup- no unnecessary build in appsCons- heavier than other phones- apps lag sometimes- the metal edge gives mild shocks when the phone is charging	3
10389	The phone is very good to use if u have a tight budget bcz u don’t get snapdragon 625 under 10k but this product which I purchased in exchange of my old htc is worth, its battery and everything is easier than ever to use.	5
10390	First things first, the phone has really pretty looks. The phone is cute, handy and feels light in the pocket.Size-The phone is smaller than other devices, so if you're looking for a bigger screen, this will be a let down. But I really liked it that way. The screen is superb and full HD.Camera- The rear camera works good outdoors. But not so good in low light! However, the front camera is just average.Battery- Battery backup is good. There is no fast charging. It takes like 2 hours to charge it full.Processor-I have used the phone for 3-4 days. And so far I have no complaints with the processor. So, it's fairly good!Its really not a big shot but I guess the phone is worth the price.	4
10391	Not this buy phone so, Battery life poor,All honor product isNo direct video calling, No conference call,Secondary camera very poor, very bad customer tech support, so I am not happy this phone	1
10392	Anybody seeing all the configuration and specifications in a handset can buy this. It's good looking, with perfect RAM ROM and processor!!	5
10393	I didn't get my ear phones ,I want my ear phones	3
10394	Oil Painting color in it's camera. Don't buy. Thode paise jod k iPhone hi lelo.	3
10395	Camera is great and  good processing speed. Loved it	5
10396	Honor 8x is having The Poorest and Worst Display Glass Quality.	3
10397	Classic looks and best in mid-range segment.	4
10398	The Earphone Plug-In point doesn't work at all.	2
10399	Writing a review after 10 days of usage phone is just awesome... Very good processor I don't feel any hang problem till now.. Battery life is just excellent.. The phone looks premium in hand, it is very easy to read pdf due to it's massive 6.5 inch screen.. Also watching movies feel great in 6.5 inch screen there is option called themes in this phone from that you can able to choose a good looking theme for your phone.. Also I don't feel any stress on my eyes till now..the phone automatically adjust brightness according to availability of light, and I don't know why people are shouting for speakers the sound is enough and loud and clear for specific person There are some problems also I faced like camera is not that good... Also phone struggling to capture slow motion videos overall if you want a premium phone in your hand with good processor and big 6.5 inch screen then definitely go for it.. If you wants to capture good photos then I think mi phones like mi a1, a2 and note 5 Pro will be a better choice now choice is yours according to me ( agar apko camera jyada matter nahi karts air above average photos se aap khush ho jate ho to ye phone aapke liye hi bana he log kate hue apple ko dekhkar pachas saath hazar rs kharch kar dete he to ek premium phone hath me lena chahte ho to honor 8x best he)I hope that honar will provide a update regarding camera.. Because if we show photos to someone from your honor 8x then no one will believe that the picture is taken from 20 mega pixel camera	5
10400	Battery life is very good	5
10401	camera is not satisfies to u and i will suggest any one dont purchase this items	1
10402	Only one word to describe this phone...English: ‘Awesome’Hindi: ‘Zabardast’At the very first glance it captures you heart.Technicality part, I suppose its already mentioned in the reviews...Over all, a Stylish, smooth & a very resourceful phone.Definetly recommended :)	5
10403	It's a really terrible experienced with mi a2 battery life is so disappointing need to charge 3-4 times a day even don't play any games manufacturer should fix these problem otherwise it's very hard to continue with these phone and need to drop and move to other brandcamera is also stuck when clicking continuesly 2-3 pic don't know why....?Overall very bad expirience to have these not satisfying service these time	2
10404	battery backup, camera, picture quality,network speed, ram speed, screen width everything exelant. sound quality not great. but ok.no heating issue.	5
10405	I bought this mobile at only ₹13500.Camera quality is  very good.Display is also very good.Battery life is not good at all.If u r doing heavy gaming in this mobile, battery drains so fast.U have charge it 2-3 times a day.If u r normal user it pass whole day in 1 charging.Processor is amazing.No lag and hang.Stock android is good.	4
10406	Well Nokia haven't stood up the standards.  Not much satisfied with the phone.	3
10407	The processor of the phone is very poor	3
10408	Everything is good.	5
10409	Larger screen with good resolution, the screen would make others look at your phone. The output of the sound/music in speaker as well as in earphone is awesome, the better output could be experienced with earphones like Sennheiser, JBL, Boat etc. It would have been great if the kit comes with latest bass earphone and unsatisfied with the normal earphone that was in the box but the sound quality is decent. 4GB RAM along with 64GB internal storage helps the phone remain smooth (No lags) as expected even when the background apps are active and no heating issue. The rear camera is awesome with built-in effects Portrait Backdrop & Portrait Dolly and the front camera is good in default resolution. Moreover, the best budget phone that could be considered by Android users/Samsung lovers.	5
10410	"""picture quality"" just superb great work by honor. Battery life also decent best smart phone killer deal must buy."	5
10411	1. Battery Life is best.2. All games Are working properly without lagging.3. Face unlock & Fingerprint is Quite good.4. Very very very very worst Part is camera, Camera quality is not upto the mark, very disappointed by poor camera.5.Please give us some update for improvement of camera.6. Mx Player Is Not working in this phone.	2
10412	Sd card and audio jack slot is not available. Battery backup is not good and also not providing turbo charger for fast charging. Waste of money....Will not go for Mi again or purchse phone from Amazon in future as they also not replaced it when I approached.	1
10413	Nice product at this price level	5
10414	Very good mobile for it's price range.	5
10415	Below average becauseCampare to this mobile price range many phone in market better than this	2
10416	Very dissapointed by the software quality of this phone! It keeps on restarting if we are not using the device! Within just a month of purchase I started facing this issue. What will be the conclusion now?Should I dispose this or will I get a replacement for this?	1
10417	Nice work and good luck to mobile	5
10418	They need to improve in camera area.. apart from camera, performance wise this is best choice	5
10419	Best Wishes	4
10420	I expected some large display.. but this phone is small in size compared to another 5.7 display (like lg stylus 2) phones..Watever it is , it is so cute n beutifull nice to use this.. front camera is not as much as powerfull that it is came of 24mp	5
10421	Good looking phone, but bad hardware design. Has heating issue at the top left half near the volume keys. If that happens to do something with the processor/heatsink location, it should have been properly designed to let the heat distribute. Else it’s not a great/safe feeling to hold the phone with a side heating way lot more than the other. LG is a great brand, so I am hoping it would take customer inputs seriously and bring an improved product in future. Till then, it’s not the phone for me. If someone is fine with that mentioned heating issue, I believe it would be a good phone for you.	3
10422	I like camera ...But battery life is not so good.	5
10423	best phone at low budget	4

I don't know how this much price nearly 20K mobile is having this much issue. there is serious R&D, and quality issue with NOKIA, I am shocked with the performance of battery and camera too. It is degraded when small players are coming with good standard, in that era substandard item like this unacceptable.	2

10570	If you are looking for a decent phone with good looks, go for it. Have been using it for 3 months now and it's working fine. Battery life is also good and lasts full day of heavy usage. Picture quality is quite good for the back camera but things could have been improved with the front camera. Sound is just perfect.	5
10571	Except camera everything is good	4
10572	Memory card slot missing.Battery life not as much good as Mi note 5	4

10579	Likes: build quality, look and feel, battery life(2 days), Newness in UI and UX, FHD play quality, No lag(octa core snap dragon processor),Dislikes: No 3GB/64GB option, poor indoor quality pictures, little bit bulky in thickness, no full screen display for videos(notch area unusable)The mobile is worth the money and is a good option to buy at this cost which comes with FHD display, snap dragon processor, many sensors and a big 4000mAh battery.	5
10580	Over all good package in this price.Body to display ratio is not well.	4
10581	It;s just been a week and from day 2 I started seeing performance issues like google play music hangs, frequent call drops, no signal on phone. If it was SIM issue or network issue I should have faced similar issue with my previous mobile which was Samsung J7. Camera quality is also very poor. NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH NOKIA 6.1 (2018)I call Amazon technician even he declined to accept that it is Phone issue. As the issue is intermittent I cannot prove the issue then an there.	3
10582	First of all thanks to honor for making budget friendly mobiles in this price.camera is not upto satisfaction but after software update you will get the better one.processor i m not gonna say because its awsome,overall at 15k its a better choice.	5

10592	After one week usage review : I purchased 11/08/2017 and I  returned 19/08/2017 because  worst product of lg q6 because over heating of while charging ,internet usage and watching videos , poor battery normal usage also half day only battery backup, it not worth 15k,  but mobile looking smart and handy	1
10593	Picture quality superb	4
10594	Price + Description = Awesome	4
10595	always used pure android nexus phones and Android one amazing too.	5
10596	Superb Look honor 8X	4
10597	pros :- good screen size- good camera quality- good performance- storage is very good- ram is also good- stock android (may be update after sometime)cons :- no sepaeate audio jack available for headphone- no option to skip swipe screen to unlock the phoneoverall this smartphone is very good in this price range. you can surely go for it.	4
10598	Worth of buying	5
10599	Like battery life and dislike camera quality	3
10600	The phone gives better performance and speed even though the processor is not the latest one.Face unlock is accurate and responsive just like the fingerprint sensor.Face id become less accurate at night, I understand this is common among similar phones like realme and so on.cameras are good,selfi camera does the work better than any other 5 mp camera, but performance is not up to the mark at low lights.selfi camera frame is somewhat small,capturing area coverage is small.Display is awsome,battery is also good.I think you can choose this phone for a person looking for almost good processor, good quality veiwing and especially the notch display lover should try this.....	4
10601	Defective piece is give to me...it is very hanging on androidone name....continous blinking the name on and off....it is waste of money...please pickup it and give to my money back....total waste of money.....	1
10602	"Nice phone in 15K , Display Is Great , Iris Blue Color Is Also Good In Looks , Very Light Weight ..Over All ""Great"" Phone .. Amazon Exchange Offer Is also great"	5
10603	Product is ok but service is very poor for Amazon....	1
10604	The picture quality was not so bad and the battery life is good but the sound quality was bad.And the other big problem with this device is it hangs alot and some time the call was not connected on jio network.	3
10605	Very nice products	5
10606	The picture quality is just gorgeous...... Very perfect dae rear one...  But front cam. Is not upto da mark.. Need to improv... Sound  quality is descent..	5
10607	The camera is awesome, no doubt about it's camera quality and sound quality. The problem is battery and also missing 3.5 mm Jack. But overall this phone is great in it's price range.	5
10608	please do not buy this phone. It simply overheats too much specially during video calls. It gets heated up so much that one point I thought it will catch fire. I couldn't hold it in my hand literally. The same issue is there while calling too and you will get headache because of that.On top of this, phone is very very slow. It can't handle normal browsing. Completely useless product by lg. If you can't use this phone for basic things like calling and browsing then what use keeping this phone.On top of this, amazon is not accepting return. They say install smart check app and then based on the results they will accept. When I tried the app, it shows battery temperature as 40 and accepted level is supposed to be < 48. I think that smart check app is smartly developed in order to make it impossible to return this pathetic device.I have shopped so much in amazon. This is one of the worst. My sincer request to anyone looking at this device. Don't spend your money on this and regret later	1
10609	The product built quality is excellent. Looks good.But that's where I got fooled.It's an extremely slow phone. There is a general lag on everything. Press the button and wait. Camera recording has a lag!!!!!!??? In this day and age. Phew! Touch screen is absolutely not the best in terms of responsiveness.	3
10610	after a long period a very good mobile from MotorolaREAD MORE	5
10611	Defective product, in one month am facing display issue, and it's not because of physical damage, please do not buy they will provide poor quality products	1
10612	nice products of MI	4
10613	The quality of Glass is very low . I just slipped and phone screen is broken and now the price is 5500 to recover it.	2
10614	the phone has it's cons, as many reviews have enumerated in detail. But the pricing during the August deal, along-with my repugnance for Chinese phones, clubbed by the pathetic launch delay for Nokia 6, made this my choice. And it hasn't left me disappointed.	5
10615	Excellent performance , awesome picture quality.	5
10616	Phone is awesome.... Comfortable to use... No heating, lagging... If your budget is limited... Go for redmi 6 pro!	5
10617	Compact one. Nice looks. But u have to compromise on front camera	4
10618	very nice must buy but you can buy realme 2 at ₹11000 at same specificationREAD MORE	5
10619	very bad camera quality and also it gets heated	2

10622	1. Bought as replacement of Radmi note 3, And not even better then that mobile.2. Picture quality is decent but still note 3 had 16 mp camera , couldnt take a selfi coz i didnt detect all faces , emabraced in front of friends.3.After placing screenguard touch is not working smooth at all, very poor thing.4.notch of this mobile is as useless as 3rd golkeeper in a football match.It can eat top portion of ur whatsapp.5. Small size makes it more terrible game is not fun at all .6. Go buy Radmi note 6 ,5,or 3 instead of this useless mobile7. Packing and delivery was excellent as always by amazon but mi disappointed me in this product.Good this is its size compitable , slim , good looking and white flash 😂.Just a Radmi note 3 at its worst with new miui 10  oreo nothing more.	1
10623	Perfect size , mast battery backup, hundred % good product	5
10624	VERY NICE.	5
10625	Only front camera slightly low	4
10626	Have been using for 3 and a half months now.Not giving any problem  till now.	4
10627	Goob	4
10628	Overall the phone is good  but the camera is bakwaas.. disappointed with Xiaomi .	3
10629	Bought this because I was very impressed with the Mi A1 camera that a friend had. Lives upto the camera expectations. Compared the cameras with much more expensive phones like pixel or s9 and it is almost as good for a fraction of the price. Portrait mode is so good on both the rear and front cameras. The rear camera also allows for toggling between 12mp and 20mp for taking better low light photos using 20mp as a primary sensor.It also got an update which claims to improve the battery life even further. Will check and update the review.	5
10630	Nice phone.. But SD625 and 5mp selfie camera is not that great..!	4
10631	Phone  is good	5

10639	Remote sensor missing	5
10640	Screen is a killer .. very nice display in such price segment...yes you will miss some features which you can get in China made phones in this price range but you won't regret after buying LG q6...and remember this is LG	5
10641	Selfies problem....I don't why my phone only selfies catching not good	5
10642	Decent phone for the money paid . AI works fine,but front camera is not dat gud. Overall happy with the phone and other features.	3
10643	It is truly amazing phone in 15k. Little bit heating in starting but after few hours of usage it is normal now.Loving the phone display and compact design.It deserves 5 stars.	5
10644	Some basic features missing like motion and gesture control.. otherwise its good and battery life is fine pictures quality is impressive	3
10645	"Only one point I want to highlight is ""IT's being HEATED while charging and long talks""... apart from this, it's awesome... and also camera is amazing without any doubt.MUST BUY in this range"	4
10646	Too much hanging prob main prob is Heating with in 10 mine.....which is serious prob,its may b blast.mostly every month we listen mobile news continuously ........never recommend to others	1

10670	What a magnificent phone it is.!!1.The battery life is awesome. With a morerate usage, the battery easily goes for 1 and half days of battery life.2.Camera quality is awesome. The pics taken with aperture mode and night modes are brilliant.3.There are no lags and heating issues as of now.4. Initially i was bit skeptical about the phone. However after a usgae of 14 days i ak pretty sure that i have made the correct choice by not going with Realme2 pro or Redmi Note 5 pro.The only take away is the OS EMUI which needs improvement in some areas so as to enable more smooth experience for users.	5
10671	Compact design.. Amazing full vision DisplayNo lagging while playing games.. Love taking photos in wide angle selfie	5

10682	"The quality on this budget device is top notch. I've had no problems with my day to day tasks, battery is still settling in, but I'm getting little over a day, with netflix, youtube, browsing, 2 - 3 calls and constant IM's. I play PES 2017 and Unkilled on all my phones, including this and the gaming experience is way above expectations, thanks to the gorgeous screen, have experienced no lags whatsoever., just make sure you do not have too many apps open in the background.It does seem a little slow initially, but i figured its the animations, so, I lowered the animation scale to .5 under developer options and now the phone zips through everything. I have 5 to 6 apps open in the background at any given time and have still around 1.6 GB free. I definitely think power users would find this phone a little slow, but if you are buying something with a snapdragon 435, you should be ready to use it like that too. I bought this only because of the screen and the build quality and I'm totally enjoying the experience, including the face unlock. Unlike finger print scanner, need to constantly save your face under ""improve face recognition"". If you keep saving under different conditions and lighting, the face unlock works like magic. I tried to unlock with my photo, but it didn't work, so, yay!.. Camera is 6/10. Some shots come out really great, low light photos are not too bad too, but they do seem washed out. I have to edit all photos that I take on this phone to get the exact effect and make it presentable, I must say though, the editing software is great on this, you can control ALOT of the components of the picture, apply a filter and then further enhance with the editing tool. Music is amazing too, would have loved an equaliser though. There is an option to increase/decrease the pitch and speed, but i think that's useless, an equaliser would have made more sense. A Quick charge is all I'm missing on this phone, hopefully, once the battery settles in, that should improve. It's a great phone, calls are crisp and no issues with noise and the other person has no issues too, the mic and speaker are top notch. I would say that before buying, think about what all you require in a phone, if reading, watching and general gaming and general phone usage is what you're looking for, the build quality on this beats all the Chinese brands by a mile. You should get one, the 5.5 inch screen with the 18:9 ration is big and yet fits beautifully in the hands, after all, in a smartphone, the most contact is with a screen, if you are a regular user and do not want to shell out big money just to get the stability a high-end phone provides, you should get this."	5

10686	Best in budget phone sectionBattery could be better if 3500+But it is only 3000mAh which work 8-10 hr on average uses.Pic quality 5🌟Sleek design 5 🌟Battery performance 3.4 🌟	4
10687	good colors n cam for this price	4
10688	I dislike the color. Phone is not that fast hangs a bit	4
10689	Using this phone for last one month, battery life is above average , snapshots are clear in day light , functioning and performance wise its the best one i have.	5
10690	Great phone with brilliant screen and premium product.	5
10691	Nothing to be dislike	4
10692	Superb value for money mobile very Happy!👌Thank you Amazon for amazing offer!	5
10693	"""picture quality good sound quality very good but battery very very bad"	4
10694	So worst camera  front and back...sound quality is also not gud..better check with another mobiles for this why people are giving 3 and 4 stars dont know ..those are fake are genuine i get doubt abt these product	1
10695	Good phone for the price.	5
10696	Sound quality could have been better..	5
10697	Up to the mark	3
10698	Best mobile under 13000	5
10699	Picture quality & battery quality is good but sound quality is not good	4
10700	"Like:1. Fast charging (excellent)2.  slim and good built quality, except for the protruding camera on the back.3. Good picture quality at the price range.4. Good performanceDislike:1. Stock android is not the likely option for those who love MIUI. It kills all the fun. The feature provided are so basic that you can't even edit a picture. The only gesture provided is ""quick double press power button for camera"". Not even a dedicated button to silent/ring your phone (you have to press the volume button). There are so many such silly issues. Mi A2 with stock android is the worse experience I had ever had with MI phone.2. Battery backup is horribly bad (I have to recharge twice a day even if for moderate use (whatsapp, hotspot)).3. Battery saver option will display annoying red color bar on the top and bottom screen. Terrible choice!4. No choice to restore my backup from Mi account. The option is available in all other Mi phones (feels like betrayed by Mi).Verdict: if you are not a fan of Mi (haven't use Mi phone) the ""Dislike"" written above may not be much relevant to you except for the battery backup. But if you have been using Mi phone and love the feature of MIUI, this Mi A2 won't be a good choice."	2
10701	The phone is very good for its price. I wish there was no bloatware loaded & little more refined interface. Also I wish it had nfc & double tap wake feature which itsnt avaialbe, otherwise its the best phone.	5
10702	Need to improve camera pics extra boosting coloursAnd sound level poor when you connect ur earphones	3
10703	Nice phone but back glass is cracked in 1 3 weeks  phone is awsm but my back glass iscracked	4
10704	500 rupees is expensive. But phone is very nice. And nice performance 6 pro 👌. My opinion is that when the phone is 10499 then buy, ok bye all dear friends	5

10716	Money waste	1
10717	This time MI have disappointed..only due to battery backup. I love Mi for it's feature pricing and battery. But with this phone battery backup is not as a Mi mobile. Rest all is very good specially camera is superb also in low light.	4
10718	This phone has created a very good first impression by its display.The best thing about this phone is its display and smooth UI.I really love the compactness.After using so many china phones, I feel LG Q6 offers good quality for money.	5

10729	Horrible experience.Rear camera broken within 15 days without any scratch or excessive pressure. I bought it on 30th july today morning when I removed it from my pocket I was shocked, At first I thought that the camera cover broken but after clearing the glass cover I realized that camera does not working. Pls suggest me what to do mow?	1

10731	Genuine product	5
10732	Bs.. Not good for heavy use ..	1
10733	The body is so sexy, the notch make it even beautiful. The camera quality is not upto the mark.. :( Still u can get decent photograph in good lighting.18:9 ratio screen display is not supported by some apps yet.4000mAh battery have enough juice to last a day.Chipset is powerful enough to run mid level games with quality.Speaker is loud and clear.The display is bright n stunning.MIUI is fun for those who loves to customize their phone interface.Phone feels great in your hands, its not bulky at all.	5
10734	Screen-great as ppi is very much.Sound-You can't expect more than this from phone's speaker.Battery-Godd because of 4000 mAh.Camera-Quality  is good but disappoints as blur is very little. In zenfone M1 you can adjust the blur.Processor should've been upgraded.LED is only of white colour. I don't know why they discontinued the colourful LED. It helps us to recognise notification in off  screen too. Well competitor Realme doesn't have LED.The improvement they can do is to give feature of adjustable blur effect in portrait mode. And please give those colourful LED notification back.	4
10735	All things are good. But battery life is not good.	4
10736	Best Budget phone with all the features. I bought it on exchange and got it for 11.5k. Screen is Awesome	4

10755	Only one disappointment in this phone that is it' don't support dual 4g volte that's the major con for this mobile because Redmi providing  dual 4g feature in low cost(6A,6).redmi6 and 6A with low cost we got better features than Redmi 6 pro only one difference the processor and battery. Overall it's a good phone.	4
10756	Best offer I got in exchange.... Gift to wife and thing is She's happy.... Processor, speed, rear camera quality is nice.... front camera is not much good as compared to others... And one more negative point is that you will not get good case/cover of this lg phone.	5

10793	Within 10 days of purchase, MI A2 start malfunctioning and it is started restarting and sim 1 showing invalid. MI is not replacing the product as well. If you are comparing the MI A2, MOTOROLA and NOKIA 6.1 Plus then dont go for MI A2. If your MI product is malfunctoning then dont expect to replace because MI is really not good in service.Its a REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE OF MI. Dont Buy MI A2 better go for other option. Waste of money.This is my first and Last MI product.	1
10794	Don't buy this mobile who are looking for camera...totally disappointed with this mobile camera	1
10795	All is good but battery is not that much and also not for pubg smooth gaming, sound pictures all are good	4
10796	Battery life is good. Picture quality is decent. Good phone in this price	4
10797	The service of Motorola is extremely incompetent. Am living 80kms away and have travelled to the place 3 times to get my MOTO G6 fixed. Suddenly, as am speaking on phone, the other party can't hear me at all. Am sure it's a hardware issue... But the so called experts here just keep the phone overnight, do factory reset and return it back. Extremely disappointed. Phone in warranty and yet these jokers don't do anything. Am sure other brands would have replaced the defective piece ...Hope Motorola does something about this.Update:I wish I can take the 1 star away too!! REALLY FRUSTRATING.After getting Moto reply, called Neotel and the person on phone simply says that they didn't post any response. I cannot travel another 80kms for nothing.Motorola sucks. Motorola sucks. And NEOTEL sucks. You may have a good product but if this is the response for a phone in warranty, am never going to go for it ever again.	1
10798	Nice mobile battery 4500  amh hone chaiye so this product is completely pack	5
10799	"CONS1. I felt intermittent mild shock on back panel when I am using phone.2. There are few MI inbuilt apps which we can neither uninstall nor avoid annoying their ads. They self update even after selecting the option ""Don't update"" in settings.3. I've used MI Redmi 4 before whose battery was same as this, 4000mah. Comparing the discharge rate with my usage this discharges quick(even aft disabling face unlock).4.Sometimes I don't get my downloaded photos and videos in gallery/file managerPROS1. Rear camera is decent and less noises due to high quality sensors2. This is one of the few phone which has less screen size with notch display(this is for those who like small screens)3. Sound is loud and good.4. Durable, as I slipped many times and fell on screen the display didn't break."	3
10800	decent product really	5
10801	Display good. Camera average . battery backup vary bad	3
10802	2 times they provided defeted phone ..i am very disappointed.. After return again provided defected product speaker not working	1
10803	After using it for 15days I have written this review. In my opinion this is the best phone in this price segment. Good hardware , minimum bloatware, fluent performance & the most important point perfect size phone . Superb metal unibody design & top notch finishing makes it value for money. Personally i don't like glass body phone ( look like a cheap phone). All the phones have some limitations but most important point of this phone is feel good factor in hand.	5

10830	Camera asmBattry not good	4
10831	After using the phone after four days I am writing this review.  Phone looks pretty awesome, you don't feel that you purchased in the price range of 15K and you will feel premium in hand. No headphones on the box might disappoint you a little. Camera effect is decent, one thing I am not satisfied with is the noise in the image, its yuk . You can feel the effect on image, but you will not be satisfied on it due to the noise in it , while zooming can be seen clearly. Next the screensize, though size is much bigger, you won't need second hand to support it . Its much handy . Screenguard and cases are given already in the box,thats a good bonus and you can start using it immediately. though the pixels range are higher , due to the bigger screen size you may not satisfied with the clarity it gives on the video or whatever on the screen. Screen could have better. But its not logically possible to give everything for this range, so its an acceptable clarity on this range phones. Next battery,  I never felt any phone holding the battery much longer time even after heavy use. It will come more than a day . Phone is not hanging even after loading multiple apps. Played Pubg, works very faster than my galaxy s8. Speed you can even compare it any high end phones,Such an incredible speed you get for 15K under. So everything are given more than the price range. Go for it guys.. you will fallen in love with this beauty all day.	5

10870	I AM HAPPY WITH THIS MOBILE..... 100% PAISA VASUL	5
10871	Photos should be better than this quality. Camara quality should be better. Expecting more sound than this. But phone looks like a premium mobile. Battery backup is very good for normal users. Expecting gorilla glass and OLED screen. But overall mobile is good.	4
10872	"Mobile 5.5""me bahut small hai,look achha haiLekin size me bekar hai"	2
10873	Pros:Value for money at this range.cons:The mentioned screen guard is all printed about the product.Ear plugs could have made it more merrierThe color variants were not available while on sale	5
10874	i didnot want what i think so, very bad experirnce with redmi 6 pro	2
10875	There have a lots of problems are facing on the phone, charging and battery rereadim and data changing from sim 1 to 2 and networks are gone of one sim	2
10876	Nice sound and camera quality	5
10877	Its good to useCamera is prefect	5
10878	Best value for money phone.	5
10879	Battery- 10/10Camera-  9/10Display- 10/10Build quality - 10/10Processor- 10/10Face unlock- 10/10Finger print sensor- 10/10Overall- 9.8/10Amazon love u for ur fast delivery (just 2 days)	5
10880	I am using this mobile from last 1 month...i have both sims inserted and i have my 4g on 24*7lookwise this mobile is really good ...i see heating problems1.  when i am doing teathring and simultenously browsing video on mobile2. sometimes if mobile signal is weak and browsingbattery drainge during idle time is superb... i meanduring idle time i saw battery drained only 1 % or 2 % sometimes 0% alsoinstalled free game which lg offered on purchase of this mobile.not seen heating or battery drained while palying the games.	4
10881	Battery drains out in day....not worth to buy.....	3
10882	Battery:Following are the charging times from 10% to 100% using different chargers (WiFi was ON, mobile data OFF during charging. If mobile data is ON during charging then the times will only increase especially on 4G):- Using charger supplied in the box (1.2A, 5V) - 2h 15m (Max battery temp reached - 32.6 degrees)- Using a standard charger (2.0A, 5V) - 1h 45m (Max battery temp reached - 33.4 degrees)- Using a fast charger (2.0A, 5V or 1.67A, 9V) - 1h 42m (Max battery temp reached - 33.9 degrees)So to conclude, This phone does not support fast charging, however you can save half an hour using a 2A charger which is considered as a std these days and is supplied with most phones in this segment. But it is always recommended to use the charger & USB cable supplied in the box and also using a low rated charger increases the battery life in the longer run.The battery juice over a single charge has been above expectations and am pleasantly surprised. Easily getting 1.5 days usage over a single charge under normal use on WiFi (No gaming). Overnight battery drain results have been impressive with only 1-2 % drop.* For those facing battery drain on idle, switch OFF 'auti sync' for a cpl of days and monitor.Camera:Overall am quite happy with the performance of the rear camera for the price i've paid for the phone. Images are fairly sharp, shutter speed is excellent. takes a bit of time to focus though, low light performance is also decent. Attaching a few snaps using rear camera under different lighting conditions.Selfie lovers will be disappointed with the performance of the front camera. Yes it has a wide angle feature but even if it had a 180 degree angle still what's the point if the image quality is not upto the mark.Audio Output:Placement of the speaker has been the biggest disappointment in this phone. You can easily miss a call if it is kept face up on bed or sofa and you are not in the room. Audio quality through 3.5mm jack is excellent.** To emphasize it's sleek form factor am attaching a pic of side by side comparison of Moto G3 (5' screen) to LG Q6 (5.5' screen). Both are same in height and in width LG Q6 is a lot slimmer.IF YOU SEEK ANY MORE MINUYR INFO REGARDING LGQ6 THEN USE THE COMMENT SECTION BELOW. I'LL GET BACK TO YOU. THANKS---------------------------------------------------------------------------------I bought the LG Q6 (Platinum color) at an effective price of 9290/- [ Exchange offer Rs 1200 off + additional Rs 3000 off on exchange + Rs 1500 (SBI card cashback offer during independence day sale)]Honestly i was waiting for the Nokia 6 and expected the Q6 to be priced between 18-20k but ordered Q6 instead when i saw this listed here with some offers and calculating the effective price.In the box:- Handset with built in battery.- Headphones (Not the in-ear type, just the simple ones which won't be probably used ever).- Power brick.- USB to micro USB cable.- Information leaflets.Advantages of this phone over others in same price segment:- Biggest plus is the full vision full HD+ (2160 x 1080 pixels) display with a pixel density of 442 ppi. This kind of display is first in the price segment.- Made of 7000 grade aluminium making it tough and durable but note that it is only the frame & not the back.- Snapdragon 435 which is the current generation chip as compared to 430 being used in nokia 6 which is a generation old.- Dedicated dual sim slot and separate micro SD card slot.- Single hand use possible despite 5.5' screen thanks to the thin bezels- Latest android version 7.1.1 Nougat- Launch offer of one time free screen replacement within 6 months.Where it lacks:- No fingerprint scanner.- Speaker located at the back.- Many phones in this price segment come with Snapdragon 600 series SOC , so in gaming & heave duty performance it will lag in comparision to Chinese brands.Impressions after receiving the phone:-DISPLAY:The main selling point of the phone. It comes with a full vision full HD+ (2160 x 1080 pixels) display with a pixel density of 442 ppi and is just gorgeous to look at. Easily the best display in the sub 20k category. In fact if just the display is considered then this gives the flagship experience.RATING - 5/5BUILD QUALITY:Pros:-- Made of 7000 series aluminium which is resistant to scratches and toughens up the phone, has a military grade build certification but only the side frame.- Comes with dual nano sim slot along with a dedicated micro SD slot expandable upto a whooping 2tb.- Weighs at just 149 gms which is excellent for a 5.5' phone.- Screen has corning gorilla glass 3 protection (Source - GSM arena) plus the company is offering one time free screen replacement within 6 months of purchase.- Comes with all the imp sensors (Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass). Generally in this price segment reputed companies like Samsung have been known to emit some imp sensor to cut costs.Cons:-- Major area where it lacks in my opinion is the placement of speaker at the back which will muffle up the sound when it is kept on soft surfaces like bed or sofa, also the speaker opening can be easily covered by hands when watching videos or playing games. Hence the potential of a great multimedia experience thanks to the gorgeous screen will be spoiled a bit.- No fingerprint scanner which is a std these days (Comes with a 3D face recognition though, the effectiveness of which remains to be seen).- Only the side frame is high grade alumimium but back is made of plastic which is a fingerprint magnet somehow.- Also no IP rating, normally we see that feature on much more expensive phones but budget phones have come with this feature in the past like Moto G3RATING - 3.5/5PERFORMANCE:It has an octa core Snapdragon 435 SoC with 3GB RAM and 32 GB inbuilt storage which is running on the latest Android version 7.1.1 to maximise it's potential and is still better than a generation old Snapdragon 430 SoC used in soon to be released Nokia 6. But in this price segment there are devices available which have Snapdragon 600 Series SoC which is better. So in terms of performance the Q6 lags and if you are a gamer who likes to play high graphic games then you will be disappointed with the lag. Otherwise for a light to moderate user not much into gaming, this Soc will take you through your daily tasks without any hiccups.RATING - 3/5BATTERY:Comes with a non removable 3000 mAh battery which on paper is average and should last an entire day under normal use. Depends how LG has maximised the potential of the SD 435 SoC which is not as battery friendly as SD 625.This phone does not support quick charge (To be verifies) and the power brick supplied has a rating of 5V, 1.2A which is very ordinary and below average even for the phones in this price segment & a micro USB cable (Not type C). Will update this section after using the phone for a few days on the battery juice and the charging time.RATING 3.5/5CAMERA:Comes with a 13mp rear shooter with f/2.2 aperture. Might not stand up to the phones having dual cameras in this price segment on paper but the initial impressions are that it fares well. Images are crisp with a good dynamic range, fast focus. Suffers a bit though when images are zoomed in but can't really complain for this price range. Low light images are decent thanks to the OIS present which is excellent to have in the price range. Capable of recording full HD videos.Front shooter is 5mp again with a f/2.2 aperture and seems to be a bit average. Highlight here is wide angle selfie shooter (100 degrees compared to the standard 82 degrees).RATING - 4/5VERDICT - If you aren't a hardcore gamer or heavy user then you'll enjoy this phone. Yes there are some major flaws (No fingerprint scanner, placement of speakers), but if you can overlook them for that gorgeos display at this price point from a reputed brand like LG then don't think twice. Keep in mind that in the same price there are many Chinese brands offering better specs BUT AFTER SALES MATTERS !!	4

10921	Overall the phone is a decent phone with some nice touches like LG Mobile switch and the Capture features. The biggest problem is the battery life. Battery keeps on draining no matter what you do and there is no quick charging which makes it very irritating. Honestly, one is better off buying other phones..	3

10958	I am posting my review after using the phone for a week... Phone looks premium but the back side plastic cover feels little cheap when u hold it.. Functions are good but the face recognation seems little irritate when it do not work in low/bad light (it shd build with the finger unlocking sensor for better performance)... Come to the battry life, its good for an average user.. But if u r a mobileworm then it might not be of ur type of phone coz its heat up too fast on the back...	3

There are none, but the reflective surface on the phone is ideal to look at your face. Overall a great stone. Price could be more aggressive. I will give it a solid (again no puns intended) 1/100!	1

10993	I bought Mi A2  4Gb ram + 64 Gb as a gift for my hubby first, and the same day the price of this phone went down 2,000 rupees. My bad! He wanted a more powerful one with 6 Gb and 128 gb which was also reduced in price. So, I had to order again. Price wise its good. Have to use it and see the durability. Camera quality is awesome, red comes out more. Helps in case you have color blindness to see red LOL.	4
10994	All I would say mediocre phone,it  doesn't look premium with traparent  back case which is provided in box,  I would suggest you to use some other quality back case to get premium look for your phone,overall screen size and quality of voice call and quality of video recording are good even both front and back camera are good	3

11037	One of the bottom side speaker not working well..	4
11038	I asked many number of times and also spoken to your customer care to replace the item with other make i,e: Nokia6 32GB/64GB because of below reasons:> the LG Q6 is lacking in quality with battery draining fast .> even while checking mails, it's getting heated up. I fear using, it may cause fatal injury.>The display quality is Hazy. I wear spectacles and face problem in reading. Even after changing the font to bold it's not good. the background is very poor.Your customer care advised to download smartchk app, its not working any mode.Please do change it with-in 48hrs.Only the item is with good look,Other things are not at all upto the mark!!!	2
11039	It is a good product	5
11040	Best......	4
11041	Main things are missing	2
11042	The phone is just gorgeous.The look and style feels so premium.The camera is really good in outdoor condition but kinda okay in indoor lightning. Same goes for the front camera.The display is no doubt good enough. It is bright, crisp and the viewing angles are good.The best part of this the battery. It lasts for around 2 days for me as I am a casual user. It charges really fast too.No connection issues. My airtel and jio is working flawlessly.Speaker sound output is decent. Not too loud and not too softThe only thing I didn't like about this is the notification led. It is very dull and placed in a horrible position.	4

11057	It's OK,but not like my redme note 5 pro.It's far behind RN5 pro	4
11058	This phone is a beast in terms of battery.  Camera quality in light is not bad. Low light photography though is not that good. But overall, it's a good to purchase for its price.	5
11059	best and better	5

11064	Everything is good with the mobile but battery is quite average and also the camera performs well in lighting condition but in low lights condition I'd say it's horrendous. Mobile also gets heated up when kept for charging	3
11065	Product is good and delivery was also good	5

11069	Nice phone for it's price point with mostly taking all the important points. The only disappointment is the lack of usb-c port.	4
11070	Overall its great for the price. The battery is awesome. Size os great too. I bought the 3GB RAM variant and it works completely fine. The only thing thats not so good for me is the camera, it isn't perfect but its okay for random usage and clarity.	4

11086	Phone is not working properly, when I make a call, the person of others side can't hear me when I got a call then the person can hear	1
11087	Not worthy to purchase. It has no inbuilt video calling feature like mi.	1
11088	Overall, this phone is 8/10. Real ahead for more details.Screen 9/10If you are a big screen person, this is a great screen.Sound 7/10It is not as loud as I want it to beCamera 7/10Good photographs in day light, but the phone struggle a lot in low light conditionsBattery 8.5/10Lasts till for one day usage. In box charger is pretty good. Gets fully charged under 2.5 hoursDesign 9/10Only single flow I think is Micro USB. Rest is perfect.Software 8/10Some bloat is present, UI is good and customization (Changeable Icons, Lock Screen, etc). Some features missing like1. No auto brightness in quick setting.2. Gesture Navigation is not as good as other implementations in other ROMs3. No double tap to wake the device	4
11089	Super wonderful Amazing phone	5

11094	Good performance,and excellent battery life	5
11095	If you want a phone with good aesthetics and under 20k then this the one to get. Great build quality and feels premium to the touch. Battery life is also good, easily lasts for a whole day with moderate to heavy usage while mobile data switched on.It's display is also very sharp and has good viewing angles.Cons: Feels a bit sluggish, very rearly though.The cameras are good but struggle under low light.Verdict: Overall a great buy since the price has been dropped significantly, i bought it for 20k and now it is available for 17k so go for it.	5
11096	Redmi used to be the Pick of all eyes. But not anymore. Problems in Battery Back Up, Camera Quality.......dont go for it.	1

11100	Review after 12 days of usageNote- It doesnt support dual volte standby as advertised in various ads. Means both sim cars will not work in 4G simultaneously.Display: 8/10 crisp bright display but auto brightness is not upto the mark.Front Camera: 6/10 disappointing. I updated from Mi A1. Had a much better front camera.Back Camera: 7/10. Average performance. Nothing spectacular.Battery: 8/10. Easily lasts one full days on heavy/medium usageMIUI- 8/10Processing speed- Good enough for regular functions. Not for games like PUBG. PUBG was set to its lowest setting.Design- Comfortable to hold. Easy to use with one hand. Good form factor. Back is metal with plastic caps.Overall- 7/10Click like if u found this useful	3
11101	Over all good phone	5

11109	finger prints on the phone upon unboxing. working okay though.	3
11110	Best smartphone in this budget hands on mi for the product. Battery and display is outstanding.	4
11111	i read some negative reviews foe this phone but for me everything is working fine and smooth. its not at all slow if you are thinking not to buy this because of snapdragon 435 prrcessor. well battery is enough for one day use, it warms up a bit on heavy use. back camera quality is okok not really bad or not really too good. and front camera totally sucks but because of the wide angle you may like it.  sound and phone quality is good, you'll probably fell in love with the phone on first sight because of its amazing screen and look, you can perfectly use the phone in one hand and it feels like you are holding a 5 inch screen phone.  if you are a normal user and wants a good looking phone go for it its best choice on 15k.	5
11112	Compact n handy	5
11113	No call record facility, less sound quality	2
11114	Build quality is really awesome. Pic quality is not superb but average, sound quality is average. Main things is very easily and fully comfort in hand. Look is very smart. It don't have guerilla glass but screen is superb and glossy.	4

11122	Its a very nice mobile screen is superb n phone is very light weight thts feels awesome. If u r not a heavy mobile user thn its a preety good mobile. Bought for my mom n she is very happy. Only con with it is battery discharging rate is high as compare to its competitors otherwise its a very good phone, rather going for any Chinese brand mobile i prefered to go with this one n satisfied with my decision.	4

11126	Very good looking phone in this price range with additional exchange discounts.Few not so good points areHeating: my phone is heating with just camera use and WhatsApp video call...the frame near volume buttons gets really hot..Battery backup: with regular usage of Facebook, emails, camera it gives only a day of backup. I haven't installed games yet..Camera: outdoor photos and videos are awesome. However, I indoor photos are not sharp.Let me know on the heating issue if its just with me I will initiate a replace.	3

11140	Much needed to mobile addicters	5
11141	i like so much it, nice speed and touch	5
11142	I have bought this product on Independence Day sale.During sale the price was 17000 Rs. And SBI card giving 10% discount so i gave only 15500 Rs. Only. I bought this on 9th August and receive this on 13th.I have been  using it for  10 days here is my reveiw about this mobile. This is my geniune reveiw because i dont want to give you false reviews. You are spending your money so it should be useful to know about reality of this product because i think you are earning your money by hard labour and it should not be waste.Pros :-1. Look wise phone is superb just like a premium phone. Specially the blue colour is amazing. 10/102. Notch display  and full screen display both available whatever you can choose either notch or full screen. 10/103. Front Camera - 24MP front cam is superb in day and night. It has no flash light it gives screen light during selfie. But in darkness selfie is just ok type. So it is good when you click it in lighting conditions. 9/104. Back CAMERA - 16+2 MP back camera is excellent in day and low light also. In darkness its flash light gives good photos. Camera has many features like bokeh, beauty,portrait. 10/10Cons :-1. Battery is not up to mark. I am a heavy user. It hardly last one day. It has charging type C but not gives fast charging port thats why it takes approx 1.45 hour to charge it full. Very disappointed about battery. 5/102. Sound :- sound quality of this mobile is poor. even in a little bit noisy situation you can not listen music and videos properly. It should be some louder. 6.5/103. It has 4  GB RAM gaming is amazing on this mobile but some times it hangs and heat up.4. Face unlock is not working properly. Every time it say it is not recognizing you.I am very very disappointing about this.Finally i want to say about phone is that it is sailing now 20000Rs. but it is costly For this phone. 16500Rs is enough for this phone. If you are planning to buy this product in20k you should go to other mobile.I think my reveiw will really help you a lot. Thanks to read this.	4
11143	Camera quality is batter than other expensive smartphone	5
11144	Useful for  ppl who  travel . Good  battery life	5
11145	Its a very good phone for the price you pay.. a value for money phone.. Its 12999/- that you are paying. N do remember that the entire Redmi series has never laid us down. You have always got the trust factor of Mi.The SAR value of Redmi 6 Pro is 0.964 W/Kg for head & 0.780 W/Kg for Body and hence there is less radiation..Pl check the SAR (radiation) value of any phone before buying, it must be less than 1.6 W/Kg or else you are going to burst your head someday because of the excess radiation..If you need a better camera, go for Mi  A2 but be ready to compromise with the 3000 mAH batteryIf you need pure performance go for POCO F1, but it gives you somewhat similar rear camera combination as does Redmi 6 Pro..Redmi 6 Pro is a blend of all at affordable price, you get a massive battery, good camera, IR face unlock, Android Oreo 8.1, MIUI 9 & a descent qualcomm chipset on board.N do remember guys Redmi 6 Pro has expandable memory upto 256 GB which is the need of the hour with so much data all around us. Just imagine the total memory : 64 GB + 256 GB = 320 GBIts a competition for Oppo RealMe 2, n just beats it.. Remember RealMe2 has 206 ppi screen whereas Redmi 6 Pro has 417 ppi screen, so choose wisely.. n don't hesitate to spend those extra bucks..Overall, Qualcomm Snapdragon 626 chipset with 4GB RAM is a decent processor which will suffice all your multitasking needs with ease.Thank You,Akshay K.	5
11146	I suggest to avoid as phone lag issue.Mi 5 was much better than this.	2
11147	No good specification	1
11148	Software not to faster	4
11149	No mobile	3
11150	Cam is goodREAD MORE	5
11151	Using this phone from last 5days.Phone display size, look, processor,  touch is good.Camara is too bad. They gave 20, 2mp rear but not upto the mark. Front also 16mp but picture quality is not as per expectation.Diply and Colours are not good compared with other phones in this midrange.Performance and Gaming is nice. But for few game details are going into notch & curved portion. I checked other honor mobiles also this devices need software updates very soon. Other wise it would impact the brand value.I don't have idea which lens they used for Camara and surely this will impact company brand value in future.Battery life - 3* and phone have heating problem.Overall, good phone bt not the best in this range.I got this on bank offer @13500INR. In this range may get Samsung J6, j6plus. Redmile note 5 pro camara is too good compared with this phone.  4gb ram +64gb ram mid range phone we may get below 12k. The thing I expected from honor is camara, battery and performance . But only performance is is good . Camara and battery are not upto the mark. This  have kirin710 12nm (I guess) & 3750mah batery , which should give better power backup. But these are working poor, same like honor 9lite, 9n.	3
11152	Its awesome overall but battery back must improve and also in camera AI should present as its costing high.. But look wise its very good.	5
11153	The front camera could have been better otherwise it's  a great phone	4
11154	I love this phone.	5
11155	Very poor quality camera..and speakers also.. after that if you talk about screen its to bad clearty...dont buy this	1
11156	Worst phone I have ever experienced.Worst battery backupBattey charging duration is very poor.Process is tooooo slowCalling issues like hang while ongoing calls.Only good thing is 18:9 screen ratio.	1
11157	Moto G6 is a good phone. Quick battery charging,good camera(works in low light too), Dolby audio,18:9 aspect ratio and many more.	4
11158	battery life is ok, picture quality is superb and has some auto brightness calibration issue,and main point is unable to read my external hard disk,so bit disappointed ,other than that camera is superb n sound output is amazing.	4
11159	Superb phone...value for money	3
11160	Camera very nice clear shot	5

11169	Best for photography lovers	5
11170	Battery life are not huge	5
11171	Good sound quality good battery nice touch very smoothly working. Only concern is its camera which is not upto the mark.	5
11172	Well honor 8x is a good product everything is satisfying in this price range, don't expect much from the camera, all though product is satisfying and handy to use.	4
11173	AVG battery life, good camera,smooth operation.updated to p, but not all features like dash board are available for this phone	4
11174	Earlier I gave 4 star and mentioned only issue is heat after several test even after replacement heat issue and even while on call. I don't think this can be fixed by update so I gave away the phone and bought one plus 5 .Don't fall for the display day to day usage you will feel the heat and battery slow charging issue and regret it	1
11175	So nice phone backup is better looking so smart &nice	5
11176	Everything is perfect.  The only bad point I see us the battery life. If it was 4000mah then it would be a 11on10 product	5
11177	Overall perfect and worth for that money	5
11178	Super like	5
11179	Good fone	5

11185	i got this phone from amazon this the worst phone i have ever used from day first it starts getting hanged poor battery backup phone heat ups	1
11186	Bed products	1
11187	Ugh, where do I start, this phone has caused me so much grief it's not even funny. This is absolutely the worst phone ever. The kind of problems I've had on this phone, I've not faced on any phone ever. I'm unable to add a ringtone. Every app crashes, even fricking photos.I have been a loyal customer of the Moto line since Moto G2, ever since I've looked forward to the annual updates and have always updated my phone, this line was the best value for money line of phone. But it looks like it's time to change. Motorola have really messed this one up.The customer care is equally clueless, they keep repeating the same instructions over and over again and just want to show that they've helped you and dont really care if your issue has been resolved.Save yourself a lot of grief, please do not buy this phone	1
11188	One of the best phone in this range ....No heating ,no lag....Rear camera disappointed a bit	4
11189	Worth..	4
11190	Good to have it, best buy for the price...	5
11191	Pathetic Handset. Dont buy this model. Dont waste your money for this model. Poor service from Amazon also.Now worth to rate it also.	1
11192	Mst h	5
11193	the only drawback is the snapdragon 625 soc which is a bit old but fine for general everyday use and if you are photo centric then its cameras are average rest the phone functions in  a breeze	5
11194	Performance is like 8k phone (of 2018), software is the biggest bottle neck, cam is below avg. Display (design is awsome) Brightness sucks cant, barley visible in sunlight. Colors accuracy is good, but dosent have color range (shades of any particular color is about 3-4 shades) comparong to my lenovo p2 its pooor and 20k is tooo much over price. seems like its just a good looking phone with below avg in performance. wait for Nokia x6 which has same design with more power SD 636 and Stock Android.	3

11238	Just awesome	5
11239	Good phone. Good looking good power backup good camera. Over all good budget phone from mi. At this price go for it	4
11240	Though the phone is using hardware of its predecessor but packed in new display and body is giving it somewhat a closer look of iphone x . One can call it the cheapest replacement of an iphone x with almost similar user interface and unlock and emoji functions. The phone is lag free , good camera pic quality. I am not into gaming but multitasking is also lag free. Good response time. Though i got it as a non prime user so couldnt get the discount as amazon didnt give me one month trial subscription as the payment through debit card was reserved for only kotak and icici bank users, a big turn off and money making policy on behalf of amazon as debit card payment was open for 999 plan from any bank debit card. Overall the product is absolutely fine and also one thing the phone takes around 2.45 hrs to fully charge, bit of a disappointment. Otherwise this budget will meet your demand in many ways.	4
11241	Every thing is fine, a good phone to use...very elegant...feel spsl when holding.But Nokia is not providing phone cover, even in market could not find one...amazon providing very cheap quality of this model cover...	4

11260	Using this phone for around 18 days and its superb, worth for the 15k..Some people are expecting 30k phone features in 15k.Below are some cons mentioned which make no sense.No 4k recording-People are shooting some big budget movies or what. even if u shoot 90% of phones/laptops give max upto full hd clarity.Speaker not  loud/no dolby or dts-you need to have dedicated home theatres to make use of dolby/dts codecs.. how can you expect a small speaker. to. give theatre effect. Also if these codecs are installed in phone its software wise.. doesnt make any difference if its not there.Camera issue-Agree to this upto some extent as low light clicks are not that great  but still AI is really good.Comparing with other overated chinese brands-Some. people are fans of other brands and trying to compare withthem and degrade..	5
11261	Its very good camera phone for selfie.	5
11262	Pick are best but stabilisation not too good. Battery life is sufficient for 1 and half day	5
11263	I have brought this phone 24th may & today is 11th june.Overall Performance good,sometimes slow in touch also hangs.Poor battery backup.Front camera is average,taking photo may be a problem as touch & click option is not available,there is option for clicking a photo by different sounds....but doesn't work at all!Heating problem near volume keys.Good outlook.	3

11309	Battery life is short	1
11310	Overall quality of the phone is ok but the main issue is battery life which is very poor, it gives up-to 3 hours of battery life with normal usage and the quality of charger is so poor after 15 days the wire skin melted and causes issue due to low battery.	1
11311	HIGHLIGHTSThe Honor 8X supports 4G VoLTE on both SIMsIt comes with up to 6GB of RAM and 128GB of onboard storagePerformance and display are great, but the cameras could have been betterHonor, Huawei's ambitious smartphone sub-brand, has had an aggressive strategy for India in the past few months, going all out by releasing multiple models priced between Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 35,000 in quick succession. The new Honor 8X is aimed at the competitive Rs. 15,000 price segment, where the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (Review) has been quite popular for quite some time.But that's not the only smartphone that the Honor 8X is up against. There are other great options such as the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review), Nokia 6.1 Plus (Review), Motorola One Power (Review), and the Realme 2 Pro (Review). So, does Honor's latest launch deliver enough performance and featuers to take on the might of these heavy hitters, all of which have received positive reviews from us? We put the Honor 8X to the test.Honor 8X designOne of the marquee features of the Honor 8X is its design, something that differentiates it from the others in its price segment. It boasts of a glossy dual-tone design that makes the glass back look and feel premium, especially for a phone that starts at just Rs. 14,999. Honor calls this a “visual grating effect” and says it has used multiple layers of glass to achieve it.However, the glossy back on the Honor 8X is extremely prone to smudges and even scratches. Putting a case on this phone — fortunately a soft TPU one is bundled in the box — is the only way to safeguard the beautiful design.Another highlight of the Honor 8X is its impressive 91 percent screen-to-body ratio with a much smaller bottom chin compared to previously launched Honor phones such as the Honor Play and Honor 9N. There is a 19.5:9 screen on the front, with a small notch on top, and minimal borders all around.Ditching the Honor logo on the front is another change that we welcomed. The phone sports a 6.5-inch display, but has roughly the same dimensions as an iPhone 8 Plus. It is definitely not made for comfortable one-handed usage, and we ended up using both hands for most functions. Still, this phone is relatively slim at about 7.8mm.The Honor 8X is available in three colour options in India — a classic black, a trademark blue, and a bold red. We tried out the blue option which was a looker. It reflects light when you turn it in your hand. The black option is for users who like to keep it sober, while the red finish would be for those who really want to stand out.AdvertisementThe Honor 8X has a 20-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor at the backThe Honor 8X has a vertically stacked pair of rear cameras with individual bumps rather than a module encasing both. There is also a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. The Honor and “AI Camera” logos are aligned in landscape mode to emphasise that the Honor 8X was designed to show off its camera capabilities.AdvertisementThe power and volume buttons are located on the right of the device and are decently large. The left of the phone only houses the SIM tray. This tray can take two Nano SIM cards as well as a microSD card at the same time.Then, you get a Micro-USB port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, the loudspeaker, and the primary microphone on the bottom. A USB Type-C port would have been preferable, but Honor India says cost constraints led it to choose between a USB Type-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack, so it went with the latter. On top is the secondary microphone that helps in cancelling out external noise during calls.The build quality is decent, however, we noticed a couple of scratches on the glass back panel within a few hours of regular usage. Considering there is no reinforced glass for protection at the back, a case is definitely recommended.AdvertisementOne aspect of the Honor 8X that is not very pleasant is the size of the earpiece. In an attempt to make the notch as small as possible, Honor has compromised with a tiny earpiece that makes listening to calls frustrating. A slight shift of the phone against your ear can completely block sound during calls.Honor 8X specifications and softwareThe Honor 8X is the sub-brand's first smartphone in India with a HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC, though we first saw it in the Huawei Nova 3i (Review). It's refreshing to see a mid-range Honor phone powered by something other than the over-used Kirin 659. This 12nm processor has four Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 2.2GHz and four Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz. It takes on the likes of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 636 and Snapdragon 660, both of which are currently popular in this price rangeThe review unit we tested was the base variant with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, priced at Rs. 14,999. There are two other options — 6GB RAM/ 64GB storage (for Rs. 16,999), and 6GB RAM/ 128GB storage (for Rs. 18,999). The Honor 8X had no problems in handling moderate multitasking, and storage was enough for a few dozen apps and lots of photos. The Honor 8X supports additional storage of up to 400GB using a microSD card.The massive 6.5-inch screen has a resolution of 1080x2340 pixels, which should be crisp and clear enough for most people. Honor touts that the display has a blue light filter called Eye Comfort Mode that been certified by TUV Rheinland, a technical advisory firm, making it easy on the eyes.Honor has gone with a 3,750mAh battery under the hood, which supports 5V/2A (10W) charging. There is a dual camera setup at the back with a 20-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. For selfies, a 16-megapixel fixed-focus camera is placed in the notch at the front. The Honor 8X supports 4G VoLTE on both SIMs. You get an ambient light sensor, an electronic compass, a gravity sensor, a gyroscope, a proximity sensor, and a fingerprint sensor. Connectivity options include dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2 LE, FM radio, GPS/A-GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou.The unit we tested was running EMUI 8.2.0 on top of Android 8.1 Oreo. An Android Pie update is coming to the Honor 8X, but the company has not announced any official timelines. The phone was running the September 2018 security patch when we got it, which is a good thing. There are quite a few customisations available with EMUI, and the amount of bloatware has reduced drastically, as we noted in our Honor Play review as well. You get just a few preloaded apps such as Facebook Messenger, Netflix, Camera360, and a freemium game called Lords Mobile.The icons look too large, and a more minimal approach would have been appreciated. There's a Phone Manager app that helps you free RAM, block certain apps, track mobile data usage, check for viruses, and keep a check on battery drain. For the power user, this app is a neat way to keep track of the phone's vitals.The Themes app adds a new Indian theme that we didn't like the look of at all. We preferred the default theme; and there are three others to choose from.Gestures on EMUI were our choice of navigation on the Honor 8X given its humongous display and lack of reachability. You can swipe up from the bottom centre to go back to the home screen, swipe up and hold to reveal the app switcher, or swipe up from the bottom left or bottom right to trigger Google Assistant. You can also swipe left or right in any app to go back to the previous screen.Honor's EMUI has its own dialler, calendar, gallery, music, video, and email apps. You can also mask the notch from within the Settings app.The Honor 8X comes with software-based face recognition. It registers your face in a jiffy, but isn't very secure compared to the 3D sensors that some high-end smartphones have. The Honor 8X was mostly accurate in recognising our registered faces, and was quick to unlock itself.Interestingly, it offered good results in low light and at night. The screen brightness automatically increases to help recognise faces. To compliment face recognition, the Honor 8X also has a snappy rear-mounted fingerprint sensor.Honor 8X performance, cameras, and battery lifeThe responsiveness and fluidity of Honor's EMUI has improved a lot over the past couple of years. The Honor 8X is a great example of that; it offered a largely lag-free experience and had no issues while multitasking with several apps at a time. The phone did, however, experience some stutter particularly while using Facebook Messenger. Switching between apps was smooth, but the Recent Apps gesture could do with some improvement in terms of fluidity.Call quality was top notch with the Honor 8X with decent reception even in areas with low cellular signals.As for gaming, this is one of several recent Honor smartphones to feature the GPU Turbo technology out of the box. GPU Turbo is a gaming-focused optimisation that claims to offer a 60 percent improvement in performance and 30 percent better battery life when playing games.We tried heavy games such as Asphalt 9: Legends and PUBG, but the latter ran well only at moderate settings. Lighter games such as Subway Surfers and Candy Crush were a breeze to use. Heating was minimal, and battery drain was reasonable during our scattered gaming sessions.In terms of benchmarks, the Honor 8X scored an impressive 140,435 in AnTuTu; 1,604 and 5,559 respectively in Geekbench's single- and multi-core tests; and 7,176 in PCMark's Work 2.0 test. These are better scores than what we have seen from Snapdragon 636-powered phones such as the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1, and even Snapdragon 660-powered devices such as the Xiaomi Mi A2 (Review) and Realme 2 Pro. As for graphics benchmarks, the Honor 8X's GPU managed 35fps in GFXBench's T-Rex test and 13fps in the Manhattan 3.1 test. These scores are equal to or lower than what those same phones managed, showing that the Kirin 710's graphics performance isn't as strong as its general CPU performance.Honor's camera app has a straightforward interface. It highlights five major modes — Aperture, Night, Portrait, Photo, and Video. Other options like Pro, Slow-mo, Panorama, AR Lens, HDR, Time-lapse, and more are stashed under the “More” section. The app has an AI Photography option, much like other recent Honor phones, which can be turned off.Tap to see full-sized Honor 8X sample photosAn interesting addition is the ability to toggle AI mode even after a shot has been captured. This was actually helpful considering that some of the shots we took using AI mode came out overexposed with extreme contrast. The rear camera setup consists of a 20-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor, both with f/1.8 apertures. It supports slow-motion video recording at 480fps slowed up to 1/16th the normal speed.Given its price point, the Honor 8X's photo quality is nothing to write home about. Autofocus with the rear camera is quick and mostly accurate in good lighting, but the resulting photos lack clarity. Night shots look passable on the phone itself, but a lack of detail is clearly visible when seen at full size. The advertised AI camera mode is almost unusable in low light as it only ends up making shots look oversaturated by blowing out bright colours.The 16-megapixel selfie camera is much better in terms of sharpness in picture quality, and delivers good image definition in well-lit areas. Night shots are below average on the front camera too, and the screen flash does little to help.The Honor 8X supports up to 1080p video recording at 60fps, but has 720p set as the default. The lack of any form of stabilisation is evident considering how shaky videos turn out. Beautification works for both cameras but the results appear extremely artificial. The front camera gets a screen flash for low light selfies, which helps in the dark. .We were initially skeptical about how the battery life might turn out given the Honor 8X's massive 6.5-inch full-HD+ display. However, results were impressive, and the phone lasted the entire day on a single full charge. Our usage included browsing social media apps and checking emails all day, as well as streaming a couple of YouTube videos and a 15-minute gaming session, using both 4G and Wi-Fi networks.The Honor 8X also lasted 14 hours and 47 minutes in our proprietary HD video loop test. It charged up from 0 to 100 percent in slightly more than 2 hours with its bundled 10W charger.Honor 8X in picturesVerdictHonor is making an attempt to penetrate the market with a good-looking and relatively affordable phablet that offers good value for money. Not only does this phone look good, it performs great for its price thanks to the new HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC. Other things that work for the Honor 8X include its looks, vibrant display, and fast biometric security features. However, the camera results are below average, the UI could have looked sharper, and faster charging would have been useful.Xiaomi's Redmi Note 5 Pro and Asus' ZenFone Max Pro M1 have been in the market for around six months now, and are being challenged by newer options including the Nokia 6.1 Plus and Motorola One Power. The Honor 8X could also be a tempting choice for a lot of people.	5

11350	Very good product but little heavier in same range mobile	5
11351	This is masterpiece from Xiaomi. Battery life is too good if you are normal WhatsApp and Facebook user then it gives you two day battery life.Back Camera is good under this price range. Only  front camera disappoints you although its good in daylight.Performance is also good. I am using this for last 1 month and faced hardly 3-4 lags and application stopped issue.	5
11352	PUBG will run on LOWEST SETTINGS that too WITH TOO MUCH LAGS if you are driving a vehicle or playing with squads.I agree it has great display but if you want to play pubg and the upcoming FORTNITE GAME on this, then am afraid u'll be upset.Handset is fast for all kind of tasks and apps, but lags while playing heavy games, and if this is something which might concern you, then u should rethink before buying this product.It HEATS UP pretty easily, battery performance is just above average.Front CAMERA IS POOR, rear is what you would expect from other low budget mobile with the same 13m.p...... so nothing special here too.BACK OF THE PHONE can get easily damaged or scratched....so u'll have to throw a case immediately.DISPLAY IS BEST under this price range though.	3
11353	Camera not good	2

11358	Ordered on 2nd May and received on 3rd under prime. Looks sexy. Camera is good. Front camera is amazing with AI. Performance is acceptable for the price range. Expect some more optimisation in software during next update. As of now, enjoying all the attention.	5

11366	under this price it is a best mobile	5
11367	Nice design and good looking.	3
11368	I had bought this phone after reading many reviews. I wanted to buy a mid range andriod phone with good camera. THis was to be my second phone. And i must say, i got conned by reviews. How can this mediocre camera phone get such good reviews for its camera completely baffles me. I mean the camera on this phone is worse than Moto g 4 ( which i bought in May 2016). There is no image stablisation. You shoot video and it is all shaky. In this day and age, imagine having a phone that does not have image stablisation. No reviewer pointed this out. Otherwise too, the phone is a very average performer. Now i will be very careful about choosing xiomi device. They are big on hype and low on performance. Extremely disapponted.	2
11369	Product is one of finest among mi products... But it not suitable for game lovers.as it is going slow for long time gaming	5
11370	The phone is awesome in look, performance(for moderate users) and camerathe cons alone i list below*Camera in low light is average, some times it produce good image sometimes not.*Supports pubg only in low graphics but no lag so not suitable for heavy gamer as the processor and GPU is less	5

11372	Good phone with reasonable price.	5
11373	Osm all but bettry life low	5

11379	Nice phone, very stylish back.	5
11380	Above Average as per the performance for this price point , but best phone for begginers like ppl who are new to UI or redmi or for those who moderately use they're phones.	3
11381	+ points..Camera quality is excellent.Display is very good.Finger sensor is very fast.No hitting issue and battery life is very good (depends on your use)Performance also good.Overall phone is very good.- PointsSound quality in earphones is not good, need sony/jbl earphones.Which picture shown in display this is not available.No gorilla glassPlastic back cover but not feel..Overall Nice phone In 15k	4
11382	Inbuilt memory 64 gb not enough. And it's don't have any memory card slot.	3

11386	Nice phone ,battery is good life	5
11387	Thanks to Amazon and ICICI. We got good value for exchanged item of Moto G 1st Gen and also 10% discount.The works and looks great.	5
11388	Looks classic but battery drains fast doesn't last for 24hr even it is fully charged. Charging is quick, charges full within 90 minutes. Phone lags while playing games, not a good choice for gaming.	3
11389	This is a good mobile i have ever seen.Pretty look amazing battery backup.excellent display qaulity..some people said bad think abt this mobile ...i have no queries for the mobile..	5
11390	Though I started using the phone since yesterday but let me tell you the mobile is cent percent refurbished or faulty product because the corner of screen is rough from all ends.. I think I have been cheated in the name of a new product and the handset given is not genuine.	1
11391	Wow.product	5
11392	One month on, I'm quite happy with this phone. Already got a FTA Android Pie update as well!Picture quality is very good. Colours aren't as vivid, but that can easily be fixed on most photo editing apps.Battery is decent. I can easily last a full day on decent 4G use. I'm not a gamer, so not bringing that into discussion. Charging is quick.Screen is good, but you will notice a relative lack of brightness when compared against a more expensive phone - but it's nothing you can't live with.Build quality is solid. Dropped the phone twice and not even a scratch or dent visible.Stock android is a blessing! No bloatware save for a few handy Mi apps.Doesn't have a headphone jack but the box comes with a aux connector. In any case, a Bluetooth headphone purchase on my side made it a non issue.Looks quite good - muted and simple, with only one low key logo on the back. People often mistake it for a fancier brand.	5
11393	It's pictures are very excited . So this fone picture quality is very good. Sound quality is also fair. Battery quality is very great . So I just liked.	4
11394	Camera is not that good	4

11446	Not happyBattery not working properly	3
11447	Bought this phone 1 week back on exchange of RedMI1S for 9000/-.As per full usage in this period this is my review:Pros:1.Compact , good built, light weight, full screen view and Iphone like a look2. Good camera3. Latest Android 7.1.14. Battery is good5. Camera is decent6. Worth for the moneyCons:1. HEATING issues occurred in the beginning for few days but now when i am using Battery save option then very less heating issues occuring. But while using multiple applications or just camera app, heatsup quickly while using internet or camera or multiple applications. This is the only one problem. But not a big issue i feel now.Otherwise, if you are normal user i prefer to buy this item. But if you are a high level gaming or multi apps user, then try some other high end device.	5
11448	Front cam not good	4
11449	Excelent quality.its nearly equal to iphone 7 plus and one plus 3 T being used by me since o e year.notch .....Is main attraction in it which I like it.i enjoy amazon movies and songs in its big 6.5 screen with hd resolution.hence i given 5 stars.	5

Takes lot of time to show what you give command for. Maybe the piece is bad and so I have asked for a replacement.The replaced product is working very well. Speakers are disappointing. Otherwise overall experience is good.	5

11491	Nice phone at this rate and awesome features	5
11492	Phone display working abnormally...very bad product	1
11493	Got the new LG Q6 and totally amazed by the looks and aesthetics of the phone.A full vision FHD plus dispaly in such a compact and handy design is awesome.Build quality is uncompromised with US Military Certification. Wide angle front cam delivers best results. Battery backup is far above expectation. With Qualcomm processor,  both 4G slots and 2Tb expandable there is nothing left. The latest  Nougut and Google assistant makes it one of  the flagship killers.Well done LG	5
11494	Battery standby time very poor, network strength also very bad, performance also not that much, back camera border painting also quality less..... Finally plz don't buy this phone.	1
11495	Very Good Phone	4
11496	The only missing option is expandable memory, apart from that it’s a great product.	4
11497	Nice looking good	5
11498	good one.better than samsung	5
11499	Perfect hand fit device value for money	5
11500	Battery should have been more	4
11501	Good Phone at this price tag.just need to improve the ui as i got little bid screen lag but it's not that much noticeable with naked eyes.overall everything is fine except battery backup whileplaying PubG ,hardly with 100% charge 5-6 classic matches can be played continuosly, after that the battery percentage comes below 30% something.	5
11502	Buy just 2 days before, it's experience is just wow with AI Camera feature and big battery life and also at amazing price under diwali sale😊. Very good to buy a honor mobile again lastly I used Honor Holly which was also durable and does well with regard to time, Wanna to stick with Honor for future also👍👍	5
11503	As good as expected. Never expect Google facility as provided as in Google pixel. Still very good phone.	4

11506	Average Mobile	2
11507	This product is not value of money. In  set like you ace selling in 5500 both sim has 4g volte enable but this has only 1 simple 4G. Realme 2 is far better .	4

11512	Android 8.1.0MIUI v 10 upgrade availableOverall good budget phone but mssing headphone as always by MI	4
11513	This phone's USP is its camera, it takes brilliant snaps and videos. The phone is light in an all metal body. The only drawback is that there is no 3.5 mm jack for headphones. The UI is butter smooth google ui; and the screen is hd.. so gaming is a lag free exp.. 4 stars only due to the lack of 3.5mm jack (albeit there is a connector that helps connect the c type to 3.5mm)	4
11514	This mobile is very very cool display quality is very much but image quality is normal this mobile is very very heating problem average mobile	3
11515	In simple sentence most bakvas mobileNo notification lightNo fast chargingBattery backup is very poorCamera quality is very bad	1
11516	Every thing is awesomely good accept the heating of the phone	5
11517	Wonderful great experience	4
11518	I can't see anything that is wrong with the phone. It looks and feels premium to touch, nice vivid colours, good camera, and reasonably good sound.In this price range, it's a steal. Go for it.	5
11519	The phone is not having a native video calling option and this is not mentioned in item description and it claims to support  VoLTE. Very much disappointed with Amazon's return policy. Please don't buy this phone as third party applications use mobile data so there is no point. And I will also suggest don't buy phones on Amazon	1

11538	i am purchase this phone is  recent, this phone is amazing....	4
11539	The most important thing about reme 6 pro is does provide a notch. It has old snapdragon 625 chipset but if you are looking for something stylish and reliable Redme 6 pro is a choice. It has 4000Mah battery which lasts for 1.5 day. It does run on MIUI not on stock android. Thanks to its design it gives a good grip. There is also blue light filter and option to tap the screen to wake up. The phone is responsive and decently fast. The camera performs decently well in its price range. Photos come sharp and crisp. HDR takes good 1-1.5 seconds to capture. But it struggles under low light. It automatically switches to low light mode. The portrait works very good. The selfies are rich and vibrant but it won't work well in harsh backlight though. The heavy games drain the battery faster. There is no quick charge support. It is overall good phone which can perform almost all functions within a cheap budget. Good luck buying one.	4
11540	Good camera quality,display super quality,front camera good,performance good.The problem is battery backup and charger is 1.2 v.You have charger 2.0 v is k no problem	5

11595	Got this one during amazon sale with exchange offer( and hdfc cashback which is yet to get credited in my bank) for my Moto G first generation. I have been using Moto G for almost 4 yrs without much issues. Phone is good for regular use only. screen cracked in just 1 feet fall, got screen+LCD replaced yesterday from LG service center in saki-naka free of cost. Ringer volume is very low, can hardly hear phone ringing if I am in living room and phone is in adjacent room. Incoming voice is also very low, had to press phone hard on my ear to listen with clarity, same issue in speaker mode too. Look wise phone is awesome. camera is average quality. phone speed is also average, only a couple of notch better than my old Moto G. people say that it supports one hand operation due to bezel less design, but i find it difficult since your grip becomes loose when operated with single hand and good chances are that phone will fall at slight jerk.	3
11596	Big chin. They could have avoided that.	5
11597	This phone is very good. Touch is very smooth and it is value for money.	5
11598	Phone design and build quality is really good. Performance is also good just felt unsatisfied that it doesnt have the double tap gestures and all otherwise it's a great device.	5
11599	This mobile can't work dual 4g volt stand by mode. It is very big disadvantage, now all mobile coming on dual volte your also try realme , asus	1
11600	Awesome phone........ at surprised price segment..... Ordered on first day...... Really superb...... Very premium and stylish, I was quite supprised that the battery lasts for a long time.... even though u r extreme game user then also the phone gives u battery for one day or else it last nearly 2 days.... Camera also stunning with AI. If they can enable the fast charge through software update as the kirin 710 chip supports fast charge then honor 8x could be INCREDIBLE	5
11601	Camera quality is bestBut battery life is not good	5
11602	Mobile screen already broken when mobile delivered.Superb mobile with super performance.No leg & no anny issue. Camere performance very well.	4
11603	At first i got a defective piece with fault in my headphone jack...i got a replacement within a day and now i see everything's functioning properly..... Thanks to amazon for the amazing service.. And except to the initial heat generation everything is fine with my q6....	4
11604	-For photography it is best midrange phone.  _smooth performance-below avarage battery-great built quality	4
11605	Best Mid Range I ever had.... All Specifications match as on website. No Lags... Space Remaining After Installing All Basic Apps Is 50 GB. No heating...  Long Lasting Battery. Smooth edges and infinity display made me feel that is is a premium phone. If you have budget to get this. Then go for it...READ MORE	5

11608	One of the best mobiles I have seen, even though low  light camera quality is not upto the mark, it's camera works fantastic in general, like panorama, focus, and especially portrait mode is damn good, even though batterylife is less intermediate of no. I am not getting any problem with battery durability, overall it's a fantastic phone within the budget.	5
11609	Its a amazing phone hangs some time but that must had been rectifed in the update	4
11610	Camera just awesome.prossesor it's make a difference from others mobiles phones	5
11611	Just Got it. Pretty good as of now.Budget : It is a budget phone.Processor : If you are a game hunk then it is not for you. For daily use it is good.Heating : Yes, heating issue is there. But, it can be avoid.Battery : 3000 mah performing well.Display : Earlier I was using Xperia Z. So bit concerned about display during video playing. Full vision is cool.Camera : Back camera quality is good. Front little bit hazy.RAM : 3 GB a bit slow. taking time while face recognition and even deleting SMS.Build Quality : Solid. Hope perform well in long run.Headphone : Very poor sound quality. This phone deserve a good quality headphone within this price range.Nokia 6 will give very tough competition.	4
11612	Good  mobile phone . Better Battery life. Best display quality . . . . . . . . . .	5
11613	Beautiful looking screen with astonishing picture and resolution quality, size is perfect to use from one hand, in this price range cant find better quality phone...	5
11614	Nice phone worth buying ...	5
11615	In moved from iOS to Android, needed a phone which works lagfree and gets regular security updates (so my corporate email keeps working).Had a choice between Nokia 6.1+ and Mi A2. Took this one for bigger, notchless (seriously its distracting) screen.Only issue is it's battery, with high screen time and 4G, the battery at times dies out in less than a day.	5
11616	Nice phone love MI phones, good camera and good sound quality, great service, very good response, good price, I'm happy	5
11617	Nice mobile small buget but full on big buget mobile	5
11618	Nice phone with good battery backup. I must have given 5 star to it if fingureprint and casting feature were available in it. Otherwise good to buy it if you gatting a batter discount on price.	4
11619	This phone excilant phone,  18.9 ratio, fullvision display, good battery 3000,	5
11620	Powerful but redmi is losing its charm	5

11622	Slim and fine. Picture quality is excellent.	4
11623	Price little high but phone is nice	4
11624	Smaller in screen size. Note serise is far better at this similar range	3
11625	Very poor quality camera.Slow processing.Heating issue.And the worst thing is the return policy,You can only replace it if its damaged, otherwise you can't refund or return the phone with another product.Waste of money.There are far better mobile phones of other companies in this range.	1
11626	Hfrygd	5
11627	Initially the phone was working fine , but the problem started after 2 weeks1. Proximity sensor is horrible , all of the buttons from the top drop down gets automatically triggered like Flash Light, Auto rotate, Mobile Data etc2. And finally after 1 month phone screen is appearing black and display unit is not projecting any thing .. So my phone is completely useless now .Hope that answers all your questions	1
11628	Love at first sight.Simply awesome!I have been a (loyal) fan of Motorola since a long time.Buying this phone was the best choice.Have the first look at this phone my first thought was it is huge! You need to use both your hands to handle the phone.The 5000mah battery makes it a bit heavy, but you get used to it.It's sound quality is amazing.I'm satisfied by its camera quality.The secondary camera doesn't have portrait mode.It doesn't lag.It supports 4k shooting.It's built like a ta...READ MORE	5

11632	Its poor quality phone.. performence is not good.. cameraclearity  is worst	1
11633	Front Camera quality is very poor	2
11634	A good value for money device, this Redmi 6 Pro, is a wise choice in terms of the battery life! My other phone is the Nexus 5X which still packs a punch in the photography department when compared to this device.I'd like to see support for the Google launcher on this device and for MIUI to allow Google Now work.One month with the phone and I'll offer 4.2/5 overall.	5
11635	not a success model in compare by samsung a7	1
11636	Awesome Build, Good Display, Light weight, total beast in performance, Glass back is a fingerprint magnet(not an actual issue), cover and screen guard included in box, no lagging, no hangs, battery easily lasts 1 to 2 days depending on usage, camera could have been better, HiSilicon Kirin 710 is a powerhouse, no regrets on not choosing a snapdragon SoC smartphone, Cheers!	5
11637	Pros-1. Display is awesome2. Camera is good can be better in low lighting though3. Kirin 710 processor4. Screen to body ratio will blow your mind.5. Brilliant design an appearance of back panel.Cons-1. Not a C- type port2. No fast charging3. No Eis4. Notification are not optimised properly to show along noth, they just get skipped at notch area.	4
11638	Pros:good displayExcellent full vision screenLight weightEasy one hand useDecent processor speedDecent rear cam.Cons:Poor battery life. Charge drain fastHuge heating problem, even with normal browsing or calling.No fast charging facilityPoor front cam.Average sound qualityNo finger print sensor.Poor camera flash quality.So not a good phone at this price.LG should improve many aspects of this phone.	3
11639	FULL WORTH	5
11640	In my phone conference call facility is not working. Very much disappointed.	3
11641	Phone hang,	1
11642	Got damaged data cable	5
11643	if you look at the overall set of specifications and the performance it delivers in different departments, it is one of the most competitive handsets in the market. It has a good display that is immersive and some nifty features such as triple card slot also comes as an addition if nothing else. The battery performance is also good. As for the design, it is one of the most good-looking devices in the sub-Rs 20,000 segment.	5
11644	Worst product my charge is not working 😠😠	3
11645	So good camera amazing this phone	5

11673	I was using Moto g3 before I switched,it was the one of the most strongest/Durable phone I ever had,but when I got this I accidentally dropped it from a height 3-4 feet approx and the screen got cracked,I got it replaced for 5k but was disappointed with the durability.	4
11674	Display quality of the phone is really great. The battery backup is quite nice compared to other phones I have used in the same range. Also I like the user interface of MI, it is very friendly and easy to operate.On the con side, I think it sometimes it gets overheated and you don't get 4G signals if the range is little bit less.But overall recommended phone.	4
11675	Ha my nems shahzad	3
11676	Battery life is less	4
11677	Phone is awesome in terms of overall performance. Camera quality is at its best 😀 purchased this phone mainly for photography and yes I am fully satisfied. If you are looking for mobile phone for photography purpose this is the right choice.	5
11678	Good phone with all latest features within medium budget. It has a large screen, notch design, very good camera, large battery. A soft case is included which I am using and loving.	5
11679	I bought this phone for the camera.. Trust me, the camera isn't good. The phone lags while gaming, signal reception is not good, battery doesn't last one day. The phone looks good, but with a cover and tampered glass, it looks like just a normal phone. Not at all worth 20k	1
11680	Love this mobile	4
11681	Amazing product at this price tag. Looks sexy and feels premium. Thumbs up for honor 👍	5

11692	It's an amazing product. Came with an Android 8 and upgraded to 9, the next day. The display and sounds are amazing. I feel like the volume in the earphones is a little low and the brightness under the sun might be a little problem for some, but overall it's great! And that too for a great prize!	4

11714	I bought it at launch in June 2018 and got a good deal on exchanging my 2 year old Moto G4 plus. Value for money , good phone, and for this price it looks classy especially the glass rear. The key issues I am facing are : not so good battery life, camera is not that great - pics are of ok quality not great, initially had trouble scanning QR codes because of some camera focus, but seem to be resolved with updates now. Overall a decent purchase and good value for money.	5

11725	The phone does justice to mostly all aspects a phone in the budget needs to. The camera is good in day light although could have been better in night mode. The negative gestures are pretty smooth. The battery life is decent. Waiting for the miui10 update though cause, current os is not that well designed for the notch display as videos don't play in the notch area.	5

11839	Bought a new lg q6 from amazon just yesterday. Front side of the phone gives it a premium look when the mobile is off. When turned on color representation is a bit disappointing. Cameras give you artificial colored and sharpened images.But what makes me really worried is that im not able to access mobile network (4g/3g/2g) on this phone.

11875	What I didn't like about the phone is that it's slightly pricey for the features it's provided.The camera is good so is the screen but the camera could be better and the processing could be faster. We have better phones at slightly less price than this	3

11877	This phone is worth of money. Hisilicon Kirin 710 is just Awesome.	5
11878	It's been more than two weeks, am using this phone. I gave up on lenovo owned moto and bought this phone. Must say, it was a wise decision to move to Huawei brand. The processor Kirin 710 in it is the masterpiece of this gadget. This phone gives great user experience when it comes to touch interface. One day charge and I used YouTube for 4 hours also played few games for 30 minutes and attended calls and messages for an hour almost, battery was well managed to be drained only 30% approx. Great phone at this price.	4

11922	Very good poduct.Display is very good and very compact & handy.Camera performance is avarage.I am using it since last month and very happy with its performance.	4
11923	My personal Review. After reading and watching too many negative reviews for thos phone, i purchased this hand set. But really this mobile is new and something different experience for me from general trend of mobile world. Really loving it. Don't believe on negative and think positive about this mobile.	5
11924	Working is good,camera average	5
11925	Processor is ok... but photo/video display quality are not worth for amount paid..	2
11926	Looks are good ..However the phone hangs when I try to dial a number from contact ....Very strange .I had bought this phone under exchange ... Strangely the order is not even visible for me to attempt return ...I am saddened and regret this purchase .	2
11927	The phone feels very nice in hands and has premium looksBut battery and heating is a big issue and camera is very poor in low lightning and calling speaker makes phone small vibrate when high.	3
11928	Thairdclass camera quality	1
11929	The worst mobile ever used...tremendous heating problen even more than 1 min normal calling...other features what co. is showing off is very moderate.not so up to the mark...dont opt for..u can get many other good option in this budget..	1
11930	Budget phone. Quick boot, decent camera, amazing battery life, smaller screen size hence easy to handle.	4
11931	have had no problem up till now	5
11932	As an iPhone user for over a decade. This phone has surprised me in every way possible. An absolute brilliance when it comes to all aspects of the phone, be it battery/screen quality/user-friendly and an intelligent phone. Love using it as my secondary phone but it's definitely gonna be my primary one in some time. MUST BUY...	5
11933	Quality is good for price	4
11934	Mobile is totally fine if you see its overall features but there are other phones in market also who are giving at lower cost.My total complaint is for its Internet connectivity... Whenever you try to open a new Website, it loads slow and also at any transaction platform its speed loses and your payment is interrupted due to this.Many people don't observe these minor problems but I have checked its connectivity by using same sim card and configuration in other mobile but in this mobile this is really a problem.	3

11938	The best product till date	5
11939	Sounds quality bad	3
11940	This much hype for this phone is too much. The time where company used to wait for customer is long gone, the so called new marketing strategy of making people to wait for product is becoming a trend. waiting for almost three months to book this product. After so many attempts to get hold of this device, finally I got it in my hand. But the feeling is more or less usual; holding a regular phone with usual display. don't expect anything remarkably fascinating out here.READ MORE	1
11941	Nice mobile with all feature	5
11942	Product is good and advanced but only thing that the led notification light is missing & no Always on display. Processor is also not so fast.	3
11943	The build quality is just awesome, the size of the mobile is perfect with quet slim structure, gives a premium look overall, with an added sweetness of stock pure android, with regular updates.	5
11944	A good product from honor.😍 Build quality is great.😍 The 6.5 inches display with a small notch on the top is gorgeous.😍 CPU is great,☹️ but GPU is average.	5
11945	Overall a premium looking phone. Decent camera quality, great vivid display, awesome battery life.. many people's wont tell you but this phone has a great battery backup.. i am a hardcore gamer as well as a office person.. often I play pubg.. clash royale and asphalt 9 legends and from 9 morning to make evening 7 i still go 10-15% juice left. Only the problem is audio quality via headphone or speaker. Even my moto G2 gave me better sound quality than this one but in 15k u wont ask for much.Happy to buy this one.Thanks Huawei.Thanks Amazon for fast shipping.	5
11946	Best mobile ever	5

11952	Excellent performance, Good quality and Value for money....	5
11953	Notch nice... But some apps dont utilize or support notch display yet	5
11954	Excellent mobile at the mid range price. The Honor 8X is quick, efficient, Good looking and feels solid in hand.The display is awesome in this one and dominates the front screen.The back side is made up of toughened glass with colour layers making student texture which gives mobile a rich look.It feels solid in hand and is easy to operate with one hand.Is a bit on the heavy side compared to other mobiles in the range. But it's it not uncomfortable to hold.The OS is slick and easy to operate... In fact it makes android more user friendly.The camera are very good... I cannot say that they are the best in the range because there are better camera phones.The sound quality in calls or music is very good. But please invest in a pair of good ear phones.The only con is that there is no front camera flash. Other than that it's perfect.	5
11955	Redmi 6 pro good ph but over priced.Superb DisplayGood batterySound decent.Notch looking good but sometimesDisturbing video upscaling.Cons.Snapdragon 625 processor old notSupport dual volte.High end games are lagging ex PUBG.	4
11956	Phone is getting heat up.	1
11957	The phone after 7 days , still very nice , performance is great , camera is amazing but the only thing I noticed which is bad is the battery life it drains pretty quick but charges fast , specially if you switch it off and charge , you'll get about 75% in half an hour if you switch the phone off and charge nothing else than the battery life	5
11958	Overall good phone but the front camera is disappointing. Portrait mode does not work in front camera. Touch is amazing.Battery is good.	5
11959	Mobile display is not working properly, breaking voice while phone call, Camera is not working as per hardware specifications, finally bad experience with Honor 8x	1

11983	Camera not good as specification,  battery is good & overall phone is good in this price.	4
11984	I got this in exchange at a very good price.After almost 6 months of use i can say i'm very happy with the phone overall.Camera is good if you consider phones at this price.I love the display very much and it's the best part of this phone.If you are a gamer then also the phone rarely lags.Battery drainage is an issue if you play games as it has a small battery.If you avoid playing games you will easily get a good battery life.Updates also have been stable.If anyone is looking for a phone at this price then i advice you to buy this phone.Its light weight,handy, has a brilliant display and a good processor.	4

12012	Bought it during the first sale, and it was a bad decision.Have never seen such a worst smartphone in this smartphone era.Cannot tell which of the specification is bad, because the whole phone is VERY VERY BAD, WORST, ..... etc.You can fill the dots(.....) next to the word WORST with what ever word that you would describe a bad product.1. Overpriced. It is worth only of 8K.2. Does not receive signal. Although when the signal strength is good, it will show poor signal.3. When you move from local to roaming, it does not auto detect the service.4. Often shows 'x' in both the slots even though when the signal strength is good.5. No wrapper applied to andriod. Hence, UI is worst. If you have used Samsung, Mi, etc, adjusting to this UI will be hard.6. Phone is freely loaded with lots and lots of defects.7. Outdated processor.8. Worst design by placing the Primary camera and flash inside circle which pops out of the body.9. Slippery body which definitely needs cover.10. Lags a lot while using multiple apps.11. No notification light.12. Battery capacity is too less.Will definitely disappoint the people who have used costly phone earlier and wants to try out this.Stay away from this phone !!	1
12013	The Honor 8X...the mid range phone..but the quality is very good8X design is very good..This is the best phone in 15k budget No one can beat 8X	5

12031	Wow it's Amazing mobile	5
12032	Overall Really A Very GOOD PHONE	5
12033	I suggest Every Person don't purchase any product because Amazo is Not Bad behaviour and layer. Flipkart is batter site.	1
12034	Brought a total of 5 Quantities of this model in Both DP & Diwali Sale for my Relatives and Friends. It's a very good phone in this price range. Brought this one in Diwali Sale & got delivered in 2 days. It's really a nice phone with Superb Battery Life, Nice Camera (Front Camera should be of at least 8 MP in place of 5MP) and a very good screen resolution. Just go for it if this is in your Budget.	5
12035	worst quality of camera	1
12036	Mobile touch pad some times stuckedI can't expect this products in Amazon Os problem also	1
12037	This phone is awesome with fantastic camera but only thing I did not like is it's poor battery backup.. Anyhow, I am not a heavy user.. so it is okay for me.. Think twice before  buying if you are a heavy user.	4
12038	Bought the product on 10 Nov, 18. No issues till now. excellent camera, battery life is good, can play games for a long time without the phone freezing. touch sensitivity is great. Overall value for money.	5
12039	Battery is best.Sound is also best.But camera quality is not so good. Average performance of camera.	5

12041	i bought this phone with full of doubts due to previous negative comments and comparing with Redmi Note 5 pro which is just 15k having more positive reviews over this phone. The reason for buying this Moto phone from beginning i used Moto mobiles only Moto E, Moto X-Play, now Moto 1 power.Except camera , everything is excellent in this phone. Even the pics taken in day light are good.Phone is little heavy due to 5K mah battery.Finger print sensor is sensitive and very fast...responds i...READ MORE	4
12042	Inarguably the best phone in the price range of 10000 rs.Better than Redmi 5 in all aspectsThe screen and body gives the premium feel just as an iphone X , the 18:9 aspect ratio is simply awesome and it seems like a bezelless beauty.RAM processing is so smooth that it can never lag or hang.The battery however stated 3000mAh but it gives outstanding backup just as a 4000mAh battery.The Face Unlocking feature is super accurate and fast which is more attractive than fingerprint sensors.Camera quality is also good.ConsJust the speakers give a little shrill sound and the camera quality could be better.Overall it's the best phone under 10000 and simply go for it.	5
12043	Well at this price point with such a display as well as a good processor and good camera it's a little less than a great deal but still it's amazing Well might be a killer. thank uuu honor for this deal...	4
12044	Internet connectivity very lowhangs everytimeu cant even update 5-6 whatsapp status at one time... it hangs like hellheat while playing gamemost stupid phone i have ever usedUsed Sony, Samsung, Redmi, Motorola, Lava, Oppo, Vivobut Honor is seriously third class among them all	1
12045	Display not support 1080 p videos otherwise good product	5
12046	Perhaps the best in class phone !People are uselessly spreading the bad words about phone .Before reviewing i must tell you that1. Its a phone worth 14990 . So, dont expect Galaxy S8 in 14990 in LG Q6.2. Why comparing a bigger brand like LG with Redmi or Lenovo like chinese brands ?Better comparison can be with the likes ofNokia 6Galaxy J7 (2016,2017)Or other similar premium brandsLets list some features :-1. DISPLAY - FHD+ display with 18:9 ratio offered by no other phone even after increasing the price to 30000 rs. No comparison with any other phone ! Simply the best display.2. PROCESSOR :- snapdragon 435, which is definitely a good and latest processor, it is definitely not equal to snapdragon 625 or 650 etc,but certainly its way better than snapdragon 615,616 and 617.  Trust me, you wont feel a single glitch in real time usage of the phone ! For gamers, i did not really feelany lag on the phone while playing any game ! Thanks to latest 505 adreno GPU.3. CAMERA :- 13 MP rear camera is good and captures some wonderful images ,Some chineese brands definitely offer somewhat better camera than this, but the difference really is not very large to be true. HDR mode on this is even better than Moto G5 plus .5 MP selfie camera is average in quality but 100° wide angle selfie lens is a big plus ! Selfies in Daylight comes out good but very average in the low light.Some photos are attached in review .4. BUILD QUALITY :- Best in class ,  US military grade 810G certification ,  Solid rim made out of 7000 series aluminium, will protect the phone from breakage on free falling even from normal usage height.Which other phone offer this in 15000 Rs ?Above all , 6 months free screen replacement warranty (Any other branded phone offering this at such price point ?)5. SECURITY :- Disappointed a little with the lack of fingerprint sensor, but to compensate that Face recognition has been added, which works good in lighting condition but does not work properly in low light ! So, i believe fingerprint sensor was necessary,6. BATTERY BACKUP :- This has a very good battery back up. Battery easily lasts a day . No complaints on battery. People are unnecessarily exagerating it for battery drain, but atleast this is not happening with me.Overall you people will really be satisfied if you compare this beauty with the likes of Nokia and Samsung  which are actually competitors to this masterpiece !One cant get the all features of Galxy s8 in 14990 paid for this device !N i amvery satisfied with the looks of phone.Very satisfied with the build quality of the phoneSatisfied with the back camera but disappointed with the front cameraOverall its a very good buy under 15k , when we compare this with its real competitors.	4

12048	Worest phone in this price,Camara is not good and battery also	2
12049	Not gud...	1
12050	Pros:Display:Awesome display, you will never get disappointed with its display.Looks and Build quality:Superb build quality and looks are pretty attractive.Performance:Butter smooth and didn't lag anywhere.Sound:Decent sound quality, not superb.Touch:Smooth touch and feels good.Cons:Battery:Just lasts for less than one day with medium usage.Heating:Very much heating even playing a normal game, it is becoming soo hot, feels like side metal only getting heated, remaining body is normalCamera:Camera is not good at all, if you compare with Moto G5 plus, this not near to 30% of G5 plus.Notification Led:Seems light is there but not working, don't know problem is for me only.Finger print sensor:This is common sensor in even 7k phones, LG might have added this option.Verdict:This is an awesome phone, i just love it.If you are a heavy user or camera interested, please don't choose this phone.But you if need good looks and attractive display and an unique phone compared to others, just go for this. You will love this.	3

12058	"I wanted a tough phone above all, and this one seems to be living up to its claim of being ""built like a tank"". It hasn't taken any big falls yet, so it's still too early to pass judgement, and of course I use a cover---one with padded corners.Been using this phone for 5 months now, and I've had absolutely no problems of any kind. It used to heat up when charging in the early days (Aug-Sep-Oct '18), but I don't notice that happening much now. One reviewer here attributes the difference to the more recent Android updates.The design is beautiful without being too showy. It's also a little heavy in the hand. I'm entirely satisfied with it."	5

12077	After one month of its usage..I come across here with 5 takeaways of this phone.1.No doubt currently it's the stylish ever phone in market.2.Best in 15K budget till date (for all specs)3.Best rear camera 20MP+2MP even in 20-25k range.4.Battery Life is Pretty Good for 3750Mah. It could be be better. But still it's ok.5.Ram Management is pretty OK. It just lags once or twice while playing large games.(Overall judgement)VALUE FOR MONEY.	5
12078	Battery issu this phon	5
12079	Screen looks amazing. Heating issues on back side with continous usage. Primary seem is the most irritating part, doesn't receive signals properly. In 4G mode once call comes in Data is lost, dont know why.Screen allready broken with a mere 1 feet fall. Have to replace. Lets c how customer service goes.	3
12080	Everything is good except the battery whicb drains fast LG software is half baked. But the mobile is very sturdy deopped many times but no signs.Camera is just ok. LG need to refine	3
12081	Very good battery life and battery backup is very good	5
12082	Selfie camera is good. Back camera is not much expected. Google GUI often goes not responding nearly 100+ times crashed	4
12083	Picture quality is ok can be better, YouTube video download is taking time.	5
12084	I'm thinking not to buy wide angle lens for my DSLR after taking landscape/portrait pics from Mi A2.  The image quality almost at par with DSLR.One star less given because of battery, the absence of 3.5 audio jack and memory extension capability.  Otherwise, photo enthusiasts can blindly trust this phone.Selfies are bit overexposed, but I'm yet to explore the features available.Type C to 3.5 jack adopter provided is not working	4
12085	This is a great phone. I got it for 12500 rupees after bank and cashback offer.  1).camera : it's amazing in this price range. Added some low light night time photos. 2). For 3000mah battery it's good charging by normal charger is fast. And also support quick charger.  No heating issues. It's give you 5 hour of PUBG GAMEPLAY with medium graphics and high frame rate without any lag and heating it also support high graphics settings in pubg.  3). Sound quality in earphone and speaker is also good. 4). No bloatware . crazy fast stock android experience.5). Display. Nice display no problem in direct sunlight.SOME MYTH : i found on youtube some reviewer said it has proximity sensor and adaptive brightness sensor problem. But it's totally false. Both the sensor work properly no problem during calls.	5
12086	Phone is not at all recommended. Camera is not worth 16mp. Battery drains of very quickly. Phone has flickering issues.apftware issues with phone. Customer service will not help you with refund, they can only offer replacement or repair.	1

12091	Not at all happy with this phone.consCamera performance is very poorNo notification LEDNO quik chargeNo finger print scannerSpeaker is given at the back of the phone. Which is not at all loud.Only for the screen you can buy this phone. I am not happy with the screen also. Because it is not SuperAMOLED	1
12092	MiA2 has good mid range product. If you love pure Android OS then it will be package for u . Yes it's a Android one project so not need to worry about future OS update. Google promised/warranty for 2.5 yrs update. Coming to phone performance I didn't see any hang/lags in phone. You can easily for high end games in HD graphics but consumes more battery and yes battery is very disappointed need to charge 2-3 times in a day. Picture quality is guite good but it can be more better if they had inculded Google camera out of the box.Pros:1. Good gorilla glass display but heavy mobile if u add back case it will be more heavy.2. Camera is good but can be better with Google camera.3.No custome Ui pure Android with less apps.4. Type -c charger qucik charger5. Quick Android updates.Cons:1. Battery of course just 3000 mAh need to charger few times in a day.2. No FM/ weather/security App/App clearner/3.5 mm audio jack but you will get audio adapter to connect headset 3.5mm3. Type c and audio adapter need to carry everywhere you go. :PAll the cons mentioned is marginal and can be ignored it really doesn't make huge difference. So overall phone is excellent !!	4

12127	Worth the price, no hybrid slim slot very good point, front camera is poor only 5mp and the handset is too heavy in weight. Handy phone small size full screen.	5
12128	Have been using this phone for around 2 weeks now. Will post a review based on my user experience.1. LOOKS: The external looks of this phone is awesome. The phone looks very classy with the steel metal bezel frame on the sides giving it a very premium look. The phone is itself very compact and fits comfortably in one hand. unlike other 5.5 inch phones which have to be handles with both the hands. Thanks to the new display ratio which has made this possible. the display does not look that of 5.5 inch at all when kept alongside a redmi note 3, thats the beauty of this phone. the back side is glass coated so again looks very very premium. hence the phone gives a premium look from all the angles.2. SWITCH ON THE BRILLIANCE: As soon as u switch on the phone for the first time, u will be carried away by the brilliance of the display. it is very crisp and the colours are so vivid. The end to end full vision display make it a pleasure to use it and turn it on repeatedly. the texts are very crisp. HD videos are awesome.3. USER INTERFACE: the user interface is very smooth, nice and simple, and easy to use. No lags whatsoever till now. I am using LG user interface for the first time and liked it.4. FEATURES: Face recognition is good and fast. recognises even in low light. No fingerprint sensor, but its ok to me. Rest all the sensors are there.5. CAMERA: The cameras (both front and back) are good for casual photography and selfies in adequate light. For professional photography, i think one should use a good SLR.6. HEATING ISSUE: the phone does get warm a bit in the back with heavy usage and while charging, but this is common with many phones. It does not heat unbearably as mentioned by many of them. At least it is better than the samsung phones (which i have used) which heats to intolerable limits.Overall the phone is very classy, compact and smooth like butter. if u guys want a change from the regular brick-shaped smartphones at a resonable price, this phone is a very good option. Well Done LG.	5

12136	Best phone with small price......ek number hai	5
12137	I was looking for a good premium looking phone for my wife. Obviously IPhone or Note was out of scope due to there hefty price tag, however I was following closely reviews about LG Q6 for last one month. And here you go, got this during Great Indian Sale with exchange offer with a stealer price.Now about phone : since this was for my lady, big handset was not in consideration - previously I was looking for Moto g5s however its design is kinda not very immersive. Then I stumbled across Q6 which is best fit for ladies and not very huge. Its 5.5 inch screen is actually a 5 inch screen with almost no bezel. I read about finger smudges at the back but if u buy Gold which is most likely good for ladies , this smudges wont appear due to colour combination.Screen is gorgeous when you look into it, 18:9 display looks stunning which till now was only available on premium phones. Do not have tempered glass into it as it will kill its beauty.Performance wise its good till now since she is not a very heavy users of games etc. snapdragon 435 works well for all essentials apps.Camera quality is also good in light but not very good in dark.Battery so far is good and works for a full day with one charge, however its not fast charging.Lot of them complained about finger unlocking however its not a showstopper, face unlocking works well. Could have been a good feature however nothing that it should stop us to buy.At the end we need to understand that LG have made this feature of 18:9 in budget section and they had to cut cost elsewhere . So be good.. if u are looking for your lady, go for it.	5
12138	All us well	5
12139	Value for money .	5
12140	Camera Quality is best from other phoneI love it	5
12141	All over good product	4

12147	It is the best mobile phone but the battery capacity is small	3
12148	Best phone of budget, awesome feeling, very quick touch response, best UI design phone,give Snapdragon 435 processor,18:9 fullscreen & 5.5inch screen, best performance,double tab lock & unlock, no lag, thanks to LG for making a best phone this price point and big thank you Amazon to sell and give this phone, thanks	5
12149	Display is good... Camera is average... Battery is good... speakers are average... Performance is average... But overall worth for money. ☺	5
12150	Redmi 6 pro is enough smart for me according to my budget, with good features I loved this phone.	5
12151	best modek	5
12152	Battery poor	4
12153	I got this phone at a heavily discounted price of 10.5K. At this price, the value is IMMENSE.The camera is great, sound is nice and the speaker is loud and crisp, performance is great as the SD660 handles most tasks with ease.It did have an issue with the proximity sensor, but after the Android 9 (Pie) update, even that is  has been solved. Battery life is not it's strongest point, but it can last a day with medium usage and again battery performance has improved with Andoird 9.Though the original price is slightly high, If you can get any kind of discount, this is THE android one phone to get.	5
12154	Very good slim mobile	5
12155	Good quility and best perfomance	4
12156	Baterry quality is very low, phone is getting to struck .... Unhappy with price & mobile,, more options in settings is not available	3

12158	As a moderate user i haven't any problem. Sometimes i can feel lagging while opening an app.But rest all is very good. Looks make me amazed. Pubg runs smoothy in medium quality. If you want you can also play it in hd mode without any issue.	5
12159	Very worst camera i ever seen before (redmi note 3 camera. Better than lg q6) guys please think and buy i jst want to return the mobile worst exp worst cam worst cam worst cam worst cam	1
12160	Don't see the head phones while unboxing the item.	3
12161	Phone is good but I'm facing problem with it's Ringer, not working well. And some time camera is not working.. It's  irritating	3
12162	LG Q6 (Black, 18:9 FullVision Display)It's made in India phone and secondly popular brand name LG so i bought it. But the build quality is poor. LG has ashamed Made In India Initiative.  I returned this product because audio jack grip was quite poor.  It was heating a lot and you can cook food.  I guess some fake 5 star reviews are also being thrown. I don't understand LG has no quality testing team. It is heating for normal use. LG should call back all Q6 phones and look into the issue. LG thinks Indians can be trapped easily.	1
12163	Back side is of glass which makes it look  dirty every time you touch it. This phone is very good if u use it with back cover. For me, I use it without cover so a bad buy for me.	3
12164	The phone is not getting on after one month. Don't buy	1
12165	There is a lot issue of screenshots.  There is no shortcut for screenshots.	5
12166	The phone is worth burying, the size couod have been small rest the quality of the phone is wonderful	5

12169	Battery life should be enhanced and sound quality must be improved	4
12170	Amazing phone... display is beautiful but without any protection so care about it. Gaming performance is excellent PUBG run very smoothly.Battery life is excellent dont carry extra 150 gm of powerbank. Camera is slightly low side but in 13k, don't except much more.Fully value for money mobile..... Just buy it	5

12178	Excellent phone. Though I am a normal mobile phone user, but I stay connected to internet and keep browsing. The battery performance is very satisfactory. After normal use battery extends till 1.5 days easily. Camera quality is wonderful. However, the phone is  costly.	4
12179	I opted for 6 months EMI	1

12181	Looks Of This Phone Are Mind blowing 😍😍😍😍😍 , display is awesome , battery backup is superb , camera is good but it clicks bit more saturated pictures  , processor is superfast , OverAll Its A Beast At Vey Low Price.	5
12182	Cudn't give 5 star due to battery backup which cud have been better but otherwise feels & looks gud, processor (even though 425) works well with 3 gb, didn't have heating issues as many have said, camera (both) takes decent pictures..unlike the big chinese names with power packed features which have to be taken to service centres often & dnt evn work as per the features sold on paper..Trust me i am writing this after a lot of chinese fones..& Amazon..word of advice.. Dnt do big sales when you can't handle deliveries.. I had to pay 3000 more then when paid the first time which was conveniently cancelled by some reason known only to Amazon..First LG experience & its gud so far..	4
12183	I was happy to see that product is made in india bhoth camers are amazing. Good hold in hand touch is very smooth ofcourse lg hardware has its plus point it is very light weight...	5
12184	Undoubtedly a nice phone and best deal by Asus... The only thing Asus need to work on camera performance ...waiting for another good OTA for Asus to overcome this single issue ....otherwise this phone worthy in this price bracket .. utlimate experience using this Asus Zenfone max pro M1 ...good to buy because of its screen, battery, processor performance, network reception, display colour ram management etc.READ MORE	4

12208	Very good mobile no is a very good I like his product because his product better value than other,great	5
12209	The quality of the phone depends mostly on who is going to use it. Clearly not a phone which can fill the hands of every buyer out their looking for a good deal under 15k, but to me this is marvelous. I'm an avid reader, with occasional causal gaming, and that's all. Works smooth as butter for me. The only thing that concerned me was the plastic back which is to prone to scratches, no matter how careful you are. Thankfully, back cover solves the problem, but yes, not a 5 star rating because of it.	4

Battery backup is good it last for more than a day on normal usage. Camera quality is decent, front camera is fine for selfies and rear camera is definitely good. Miui and notch feature makes a good duo. After constantly using for 4-5 hours there is no heating issue, also turbo charging works well. Overall a good phone by xiaomi.	5

12320	MiA2 is a disaster! The company tried to make a stock android phone but guess their engineers were not equipped to do the job. The phones software is not compatibile with the hardware and this results in the below mentioned issues:-1. Major lag issues on using different aps2. Shuts down randomly and refuses to boot again3. Occasionally hangs and becomes non responsiveThe company should ideally take back all the phone from the market and rework on it. I would have given a 0 rating to the phone but giving atleast 1 rating is a criteria.	1
12321	Nice look but notch....	4
12322	Stunning Display.	5
12323	Very bad productTheere is technical problem in this product, the phone started hanging within 4 days of usage...Also the promiximity sensor do not work properly.On complaining to amazon for return/replacement they do not accept it.If you are disappointed with the product you cannot expect a return/ refund since you have purchased the product. Very disappointed by this thingEven for replacement of product they will pickup the phone first & then will deliver it after 10 days.What will the person do with the data in that phone what will he do in those 10 days?Extremely intolerable thing from Amazon & MII swear never to buy product of MI again. Though I've faced technical issues in MI product I am ready to replace this product but for that amazon needs 10 days after picking up the product.I would prefer any other online shopping then amazon after this.	1
12324	😁 yaa i m so happy, really it's looking very beautiful smartphone. It's extra feature are too good. It's work perfectly. Overall the smartphone is pure fun.	5

12349	I have been using this mobile since it was available for sale on Amazon.Talk aboutPROS.1. Display is good it has minimum bezels.2. Battery Life is decent enough will give you about 1 or 1.5 day on full charge.3. It have EMUI skin which offer lots of customisation options.4. Performance is good it has Kirin710 which can handle day to day task easily and gaming i will talk in cons.5.I gives a premium phone feel in hand and it is a best good looking phone you can buy in this segment.CONS.1.  Speaker quality is not good i can say it's horrible2.  Headphone jack quality is not good i have been using it with mi inearprohd still.3.Back Camera is not upto the mark even it is 20+2MP realme 2 pro is better in back camera department.4.  Lots of people are saying that kirin710 gaming performance is equal to snapdragon 660 eat shit buddie PUBG in HD have some frame drops although my net connection is good. If you want to buy the phone for just playing PUBG I think you should go for realme2 pro or asus zenfone max pro m2.The Phone is decent enough for day to day use if you are not a VERY heavy user.  Then go for it.	5

12384	Actually the build quality is very cheap, and sound quality is very poor, as if hearing the sound in a torn speaker (a kind of torn sound in background). Whereas honor 9n is far better and nice when compared to mi 6 pro. Nowadays mi quality is worsening.	3
12385	Great budget phone	5

12389	Good, compact, optimistic and awesome Phone.. It is the phone for those who want premium compact cell in their hand..	5
12390	Price is high compare with Nokia 6.1 plus	1
12391	Nice and smart mobile for less budget. Very handy and good aesthetic.	4
12392	Its a very good phone.....	5
12393	A very good budget phone for emergency or backup use. For this price the quality and feature is very adequate. The camera is good only in daylight but in night it is waste. Xiaomi haven't taken time to customize its UI to make apps appear fully without getting hidden by the notch. Many apps which take full screen are hidden behind the notch. It is just like a poor man's iPhone. Battery life was excellent in first two months but gradually comes down especially if you use lot of GPS and mobile data. I use GPS navigation, 4G mobile data and Bluetooth music streaming and it lasts almost a day only. The charging speed is very slow since it has a big battery and charging rate is the same basic level so it takes a lot of time to get charged. Since it is a LCD screen notch is not adequately hidden in black screen but that is not a complain for a phone at this price. The sound is good speakers output clear sound. The performance is great for this price point. I play Pubg all the time and very rarely did it get hanged maybe like 2 3 times since 3 months. Sometimes the phone lags very bad if the internet is not good while in game. One thing I found this is if you have two Bluetooth devices connected at a time, it can give call permission to only one device. If to both are given then the phone will randomly switch between devices. Overall I found this phone to be a good phone for maybe 1 year use.	4
12394	Picture and sound good quality and battery life good	5
12395	Battery life is very good. Screen size could have been better. Otherwise it's awesome product.	5
12396	It's simple and cute model	5
12397	Battery is not supporting 15 min. Battery backup is just 15 mins after 1 month of purchase.	1
12398	Superb fantastic touch, camera,display and all the thinhs	5
12399	My review after one month of usage...Pros:Its lookDisplayFace unlocking is fast and works vey wellBattery stays for whole dayShort cut keys provided in displayCons:Camera quality is averageCant comment on processor as I am not a game loverShocked to know it does not have wireless display feature. So I cannot connect my phone with my smart tv.*Overall it's a good phone and at least you will feel that you are not using another Chinese phone. At least is brand in itself.	4
12400	everything looks good as per price point of view, except battery life	4
12401	Mid rang phone. Battery life very good, not for heavy graphics gamer, ui need to be improve.Picture quality good.	5
12402	Pro's:1) Battery  and comming to the Con's: 1) Poor Screen Resolution. 2) Phone has some Network Issues. 3) Camera not as much expected very poor 4) Poor Performance. I tried to return but Flipkart is not accepting the return request.READ MORE	1
12403	Bad product otg not support	1
12404	Proximity sensor is far away from speaker,leads to unnecessary operations during call, it's a design flaw, in place of flash that could have been place.	2
12405	Best buy...got it the next day of order from amazon prime...i have been using it for 6 days now...not a single hitch ao far...rear camera is awesome with AI tech...front camera is very nice...battery life is 1 and half days with moderate gaming, movies and online streaming with 4G...no bloatware apart from 2-3 necessary huawei apps...only drawback is no front led flash...	5
12406	Worst product never ever go for this handset.	1

12409	Face unlock is very worst. It work with anyone face. Pin lock and finger lock is useless when you active face lock. This new feature of this phone is very useless.	3
12410	Nice product in budget	5
12411	a good quality product with no defects, well satisfied ..... I prefer to my friends ...	5
12412	Good product at low price	5

12415	Best choice, amazing quality	5
12416	Not having dual standby	4
12417	Overall Awesome phone. Power packed performance. Battery Life could be better	5
12418	Battery low 10 hours max	4
12419	After using it for 6 months I will say that This is a good product but processing is slow network problem specially for 4g and 3g where I use the same sim card in other brand mobile and it perform very well. If we select the auto network setting its never switch easily we need to do setting by changing network preferences.Rear Camera is not so good but wide lence in front camera click a good pic if lighting is good. Display is not that good and colourful. No notification indicating light is given.	3
12420	Amazing hand set. I like this. But Native video calling not supported in this mobile. And not fast delivery by amazon.	5
12421	these mobile don't have hear phone connectionREAD MORE	4
12422	charger is not good not so much smooth	5
12423	touch is very smooth and processing is pretty good. But looks are just outstanding.	5
12424	Phone build quality is good, battery lasts long,  sound would have been better of speaker would be placed below.	4
12425	Very poor packaging. I can't believe such en expensive product they packed like a chips packet..	3
12426	Like this phone.. It got premium quality and the screen is massive... Speaker and loud.. Camera is top notch for this prize.. But iam a little concerned because of POCO phone.. Which comes near this prize point... It charged very fast.. Like fast as heck lol..Really loved that... And I just knew this resently thatType c earphones and supported all through it has a head phone jack... But play two earphones at the same time.. XD... If you like Huawei phones? This might be a good choice... Yea I forgot to see that when playing pubg with my friends outdoors.. The sunlight was a pain in the ass.. Couldn't see clearlyThank YOU	5
12427	The battery drains so fast even when idle. Worst MI phone. Totally disappointed that I have to charge multiple times a day.	2
12428	Camera quality	3
12429	Good phone in under the budget with the great features...both camera is good ...looks bys also sexy...slim with full display	5
12430	Phone heating while using	1

12434	This is a good phone. I'm slightly disappointed by the camera.	4
12435	With in 1 month start battery problem , after 100% charged show 10% to 15% battery just 5/6mins use , after restart it  show 80% again	3
12436	Touch not working properly... Having issues... While clicking photos.	1
12437	It gives you so manuly ads even videos startplaying if mobile is connected to internet..Pathetic mobile,Battry does not last more than 6 hrs	3
12438	Bought it in Diwali sales. Works smooth for last 1 month. Lack of finger print sensor is not a big prob. Face recognition works fine in daylight. 18:9 display will need some time adjust.	5
12439	Phone looks like ok build quality is good cemra is not best in this segment is suggest you can should buy realme 2pro is better than this phone battery life is bad	3
12440	Very good phone, nice look,good Display quality	5
12441	When you unbox your handset, you'll fall in love with this device in just first look. As LG likes to wrap it's product in layers, same is case over here. Don't remove back plastic as back of this phone is smudge prone.After setup, I used some heavy gaming apps and they ran without any lag. And display was icing on the cake. As for camera, it is great. Quality of picture produced depends on person who is using it.Face recognition works great. Even in dark. Brightness of screen is used as flash for front camera, so you just need to adjust it accordingly. Processor is fast and touch response amazing. It does get heat up a bit but cools thereafter.On a whole, with such pricing, it's a great handset in this segment.Amazon offers make it more affordable :)	5
12442	Picture quality awesome	5
12443	All the things about this phone is good. I only did not liked about the OS that is stalk android.	3
12444	Sometimes finger scan don't work.Rest upto the mark.	4
12445	Nice phone in this price range go for it.	5
12446	pictures quality is awesome 👌 sound 🔊 is also plus ➕ point battery 🔋 life is so good	4
12447	Worrest cameras i have ever seen this type of cameras from mi.	2
12448	Awesome in the range of 15000. I love it	5
12449	All what I can say about this product is 'Awesome'Comes in a hand easily , model really looks attractiveBattery life is awesome even when put to charge it'll hardly take 1 hour to get fully charge . Till now all things going perfectly ...you should go for it .. It won't disappoint you but it will definitely surprise you ..and that too with this cost ... Thank you	5
12450	I have been given a extremely defective product. So much disappointment by Samsung Brand. To be specific the Finger Print Scanner and Face Recognition is NOT Working!!!!!!!Also, the after sales service is pathetic as even after giving the device for repair for a long week, I haven't been served. I recommend not buying this product. Samsung gives not shit about the lower end price phones.	1
12451	In this range, this is the best product of xaiomi	5
12452	It's OK, Not bad	3
12453	This is very very nice product.	5
12454	Waste, battery charge just half day, very quickly dry	2
12455	Heavy batterry drain	4
12456	Very nice and very good product.	5
12457	The sound quality of Honor 8X is outstanding.. It has a loud sound with amazing clarity. Battery of Honor devices has always been good and so is the case with Honor 8x. I've just upgraded from Honor 6X to 8X just because of its better than others services. Hopefully it'll not hang just like it's predecessors. And support me in using it as my second brain.	4
12458	deal excellent	5
12459	Superb phone in this amount... Totally worth for money.	5
12460	Battery life is not going good	2
12461	Mobile in great, great build quality, nice camera, android one on top	5
12462	Look and Comfort - It really look amazing, the Screen and whole hardware looks stunning. Most importantly, the size is so comfortable in hand. I think with the screen size, making it comfortable for one hand usage is great !Battery - I am not a great fan of Movies or Games. So it have good back up. With out data on - 40 hours backup and with data 4G on - ~23 hours Back up. If you are a fan of Games and movies... its not going to be the right choice as the battery backup will be very less.Performance - The Phone heats up a bit if you are playing games or watching online movies. since the battery backup is less, you need to plug in, so it further heats up and sometimes we can't hold it.Features - The interface is very good. it has lot of hidden features. I think, the Huawei brand soon will become like a I-phone brand.Camera - It got good Camera reviews Online. But i think its not that great, its good not great. There are lot of feature in the Camera mode, but the picture quality is not equal to the hype they give. But its Good !Overall, I got it for Rs.15500/- in offer, for this amount, its a great looking stylish mobile with lot of feature, Good Camera (But Not great) and Comfortable size (fits for one-hand usage).But not suitable for people who plays games and watches online movies.	4
12463	Hank problem occured	1
12464	My best smartphone purchase ever..premium all around with power packed performance.	5
12465	Nice Phone, meet my expectations. Love it	5
12466	Just loved the rearcamera pictures....and its ui 9.6 is just awesome.  And it is really smooth	4
12467	Charging wire was not working	4
12468	Love u so much	5
12469	Awesome.. picture quality too high..	4
12470	Too many ads feels cheap... you have to go and turn off recos in each app... even then u cant stop it fully. otherwise good quality phone... good pics.. decent camera... good battery life... appears slow at times logging in from lock screen. Poor quality software when compared to samsung... and many needless google and mi apps preinstalled that you cant remove. Even Gallery doesnt work well with pics on sd card, after card reformat also. Overall its ok.	3
12471	Looks and design are just marvellous. Light & brightness are also good. Expected headfone but didn't get. overall fone is total upto the mark as shown in pic. One thing this tym am disappointed, OTP was deleted by chance nd agent did nt even helped me, he declined for delivery and even was not giving cus care no nd solution. :)	5
12472	picture qulity nice . battrey life इस very very very nice it is better than redmi note5pro	5
12473	Awesome picture quality and nice look,good to handle	5
12474	Confusing live focus	4
12475	(My Review Is For the Platinum Version Only)Note:  All Ratings Are According To Its Budget Category and Its Price Point.The Platinum colour looks great and feels great. The Glossy back finish adds class to its over all design. The silver metal rim around it, platimun colour Glossy PolyCarbonate back panel and All Black front creates a fantastic contrast and makes it stand out than the other phones existing in the market. The glossy back could get scratched easily. Its more visible in the back one but in the platinum variant its almost negligible. But it does gets scratched. If you look side by side This Phone Some How Manages To Look Better Than Iphone 7 and 7 plus. The phone feels very comfy in hand and manages a very slim and compact profile with no bulkyness at all. The Mil-Stg-810G metal Rim around it gives it a rigid Feel and the phone is not fragile by any means. I have tested a couple of drops from 6 feet and zero damages till now.Out of 10 the looks, feel & Build gets 8.5.The 18:9 Full HD+ 5.5 Inch screen is Amazingly vibrant and Gorgeous. The Color Production is really good and no pixellation could be Found. If u compare it with LG G6 the screen looks quite similar only with a smaller size. Though G6 have a Quad HD Plus Display the Differences are Minimal. The Viewing Angles Are Amazing without any color shifting. Sunlight visibility is a bit more than Decent, not that immersive but u can centainly see in max brightness. It reached upto 460 Nits of brightness keeping auto brightness truned on which is quite higher than many iphone displays. As it is not an amoled display it wont affect your eyes that much if u are using it in a complete dark room with complete low brightness. The brightness does not gets too low but certainly wont strain your eyes. Since Its an Ips Lcd so there will be no screen Burning Issue Like Pixel 2 or Pixel XL 2 and no other phones at this price point have such an awesome display apart from galaxy A series and C Series But definitely better  from J Series.Out of 10 the display gets 9.2.The Day To Day Performance is Really Amazing without any Laggs or Hick Ups. The only apps that have crashed is the PlayStore. But i have noticed that Play store have also crashed on my Galaxy S7 Edge. Play Store Have also Crashed on many of my Phones Like Galaxy Note 3, S4, S5, Note 5 so i Guess it crashes with every phone Once in a While. The Good Part of the software is that its very well optimized. LG Have never tried anything like this with their FlagShip phones Like V:20 or V:30. All those LG Flagship Phones Have High End Processors Like Snapdragon 821 or 835 But still android OS laggs on every freaking phone once in a While. With LG Q6 the Company have showcased what really optimization Means in Real World Experience. With Snapdragon 435 which is slightly better than Nokia 6 snapdragon 430 the phone keeps up To our Needs. Video Playback and Multitasing is Studder Free and Has No issues. The 3gb Ram helps in Keeping apps running in the backgroung with minor refreshes. This is my Secondary Phone not Primary so Iam happy with 32Gb of Storage along with an SD Card. If U need more space go for Q6 plus ( 64 Gb Rom, 4 Gb Ram).Out of 10 the performance gets 8.The Gaming Experience is Decent But Not Great. Which means there are some Games that work well but not all games will be lag free. Some Highly graphical games will work really good without any frame drops but some games which are not well optimized will not give u a very Effective Gaming experience. Gaming Experience is something Going to be Subjective from Game to Game. Not All games will give u a satisfying experience but some games Will Really Show this phones Gaming Power.Out of 10 the Gaming gets 7.The Camera is some where in Between okay and good. its Decent kind of Gets the Job Done, not very good but certainly better than Cameras Which are just Ok. So this camera is Better Than Ok. Its a Decent Camera. But not a Very Good Camera. In Broad Daylight it Takes wonderful photos for any Average user both from the Rear and Front Cameras. It will struggle in low light because its not a FlagShip camera. The Dynamic range is good enough. Details Are There but sometimes its Missing. Something the images looks a bit washed out. But again its sometimes not always. The colour in the images are not at all saturated which might be good for many people who prefer natural looking images but The colours are not exactly natural. It Just Provides u a Good Looking Photo. The camera Can be compared with iphone 5s or galaxy s4 which have a really good camera but comaped to todays standards they lack behind. Video quality is Reasonable in daylight at night again it suffers. Over all Video is not bad though but could have been better.Out Of 10 the Camera gets 7.5.The Battery Life is More Than Good. The 3000Mah Battery is More than Enough on this very Highly optimized Phone. As i Mentioned earlier LG have really shown the power of optimization with this Phone. Android Phone Can provide a lot better Experience Than Apple if They Really optimize their phones Well enough. People Choose Apple Iphone because its soo well optimized and provides lag Free Experiences for Years. This Phone Battery Life Is Providing Me Between 4 to 5 hours Of Screen On Time which is again Better than My Galaxy S7 Edge which has a 3600Mah Battery. Iam a power user who plays a lots of game and watching lots of videos and kind of constantly using social media and browsing the web. You Can Easily Cover up an Entire working day of 12-15 hours remaining with 10-15% of battery before plugging In To Charge. There is no Fast Charging mentioned by LG but Charges quick enough with Lg's Provided Charger. I have also tried charging using My Samsung Fast Charger and it Charges Faster. It does not Shows fast Charging but its Charging Faster. Its Obvious Using a Fast Charger will Charge your Phone faster but not every phone Charges faster using a Fast Charger. So it Carries the ability of Charging Faster than its Regular Charger with a Really Good Battery Life.Out of 10 the Battery gets 8.5.A phone without a finger print scanner gets The Overall Device Rating 8.2 out of 10.	5
12476	Complete phone for mid range budget	5
12477	Battery, camera quality is good	5
12478	The product I got was defective. Apparently everything seems to be in good condition but when it came to charing the phone it does not charged up. The phone automatically gets switched off and on on frequent basis. Worst product dont rely on chinese product and online shopping.	1
12479	"Well, If you have already use Redmi Note5 Pro, Asus ZenFone Max M1 or any device with Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 then you'll know what I mean by saying ""Best Optimized Budget Mid-Ranger"". Nokia always had that Special Place in our hearts which was eventually lost due to lack of good devices from the company. Fast Forward to 2018, Nokia has released parade of smartphones in very short period but Most of them were not priced by Price-to-Performance Ratio instead they were more like Brand Pricing. ...READ MORE"	5

12485	Not bud for camera lover& not providing refund also only replacement	1
12486	One of the best phone at 15000.If you're going for realme or Redmi Note 6 pro, I will prefer this one ahead of those two.Ofcourse no product is flawless, so the only thing which I didn't like is it's sound, its too low.Otherwise best phone.	5
12487	Good mobile at reasonable cost. Keys are smooth and soft, sound also good  , nice in look,. In netshell good product . suggest others to buy. Feel nice mobile in hand as compare to other mobiles.	5

12501	Nice cover i liked it.	4
12502	overall performance of this phone is good . Camera in manual mode with Low light lens is the best in this price segmant. snapdragon processor is very powerful , you can play games like pubg, asphalt etc without any problem. The biggest disadvantage of this phone is that it does not have 3.5mm jack .People who are confused between mi a2 and redmi note pro 5 : i would suggest them to go for Mi a2 if you get a chance to but this phone below 15000rs otherwise redmi note 5 pro.Camera and display of mi a2 is better .Lastly , i would like to thanks amazon for their support , i faced some issues with the device which i received first however after contacting amazon they immediately repalced the phone ***** five star to amazon :)	5

12510	It is a beautiful smart phone @ 15k.  Honor touched satisfaction level of costumer. Good quality cameras included with features (portrait, AI, bokeh etc). Fast processor. Awsome display. every thing a smartphone needed is included by you Honor. Thank you for this release (Honor 8X).After establishing great features in the phone. The only drawback i found is front flash for camera. FM Radio may be missing by customers having 8X in big cities.	5
12511	Awesome phone. super product	5
12512	Display- Awesome viewing angles, crisp and sharp.Sound- Single firing speaker but adequately loud. Of course not the best.Camera- above average rear camera. Good image quality. Over exposed images. Saturation levels are high.Secondary camera is good but beauty effects applies and cannot be turned off. Sharp selfies but colour saturation high and real colours turned vibrant.Battery - is amazing. Charging is pretty fast as compared to other 5v 2amp chargers.Build quality- is awesome and feels premium specially blue colour.Processor - Kirin 710 is good i think somewhat near to 910 no lags but minor bugs. Perhaps can be sorted with OTA update.Overall value for money.	5
12513	Its an honest review...comparing t note 5 pro.. Note 6 pro is a best notch display,front and rear Dual camera, clarity n features f camera is nice,value fr d money. From d box it will come 9.6.4..after 2mins f usage we get MIUI 10 updates.I bought on 23rd November on a Black friday sale,Delivery has improved by flipkart i gt my phone with in 14hrs.Over all 4.6 fr d mobile😳READ MORE	5

12527	i like the product	5
12528	Display is good but lacks sound .. For this price, good product	4
12529	Design is not very good as I respected.Otherwise it's a good product from Xiaomi.If you want to a better batter battery life then you go for it. (Snapdragon 625+4000mAh combination.)	3
12530	Not a good phone in this range	3
12531	One time charge 24hrs heavy usage.Battery saver helps to last.	4
12532	1 feet up sleep fone in my handTouch was broken	3
12533	Camera is worst,it is only on the papaer in practice it less than 8 mega pixel camera of both front and rear.I have returned product but amazon have not returned money even after 7 days after returned the product.	2
12534	It's awesome	5
12535	Performance is cool but itz strt getting heated when u strt using phone	3
12536	Battery life is more than good4.5/5, camera 3.5/5 for the price range (otherwise 3),display 4/5(disappointed as can't customize to show battery percentage) overall looks sleek n classy, with HDFC offer, amazon pay cashback and exchange got the phone for 6.3k! So actually cannot be to bummed out, having said that not the fastest phone as led to believe, however, overall I personally would rate this 4 star due to value for money. No quick charge, well can't complain too much either! If looking purely for camera, please steer clear of the phone.	4
12537	Calling and the smart features by Motorola is amazing. Picture quality is ok. Working on this phone is very smooth. I never feel it to be hanging. Sound quality is really good. In terms of battery, you need to change it once every day. However, with the turbo charger it takes hardly 1 hour to charge it fully.	4
12538	Tuch kafi achaa he	5
12539	The only shortcoming is that the battery doesn't last more than half day.But the mobile charges very fast.	4
12540	Sound quality issues ......	4

Rear camera in day light is decentCons-1. Conventional Xiaomi design2. Rear camera could be better in low light conditions and front facing camera is average3. Feels little bit heavy and thick	4
12557	Got it for RS 9971 after exchange with my age old Moto E 1st gen!!!It was like a deal of the century!!!The phone is excellent.Dont know why people have put on negative reviews.Yes the battery does get a bit heated on heavy use but thats what u expect an Android device with snapdragon 435 to behave like.The display is practically awesome.The phone looks like an aesthetic masterpiece.Hats off to Lg for creating such a grt piece and kudos to amazon for the 12 hour delivery and xcellent packing.	5
12558	After six months of purchase battery performance gone down. It reaches 100% to 0% in 4 - 4.5 hrs.Camera is good.	3
12559	The delivery very quicker than I excepted otherwise great mobile for this money I refer to go for other mobile for this price ....	4
12560	Battery draining faster after updating to MIUI 10. How should i resolve to it?	4
12561	You can go through that really it's looks like a iPhone very slim camera is average everything is OK. So giving 5 stars	5
12562	Betry backup is very poor	2
12563	Weight should be some less. Front camera position should be some away from speaker cut.	3

12568	High resulution	5
12569	Good work	5
12570	Picture quality is good. Sound fine but do keep in mind before buying, you will not get earphone with this phone. Why??..  Every phones above 10k come along with earphones so to listen music or calling during multi tasking. Shameless technique, soon they might also stop providing charger with phone.No doubt battery is good.	3
12571	Battery drains bery fast...camera is bery weak ...over heating issue...plz dont go for it...no 2.5d glass..save ur money.....not worth for money	1
12572	Although it has that 4000mah battery but it doesn't go long at least one day.. which is a very serious issue.Camera stabilization also not so good	4
12573	The phone is good, pictures clicked are decent at the price point. The display is good. Adaptive brightness does not work seamless. The phone is fast; it has been 3 months and phone seems to be holding good with response time.One flip side is available storage capacity. For a phone of 64 GB, the available storage is just 46 GB. Other phones get roughly 50-55 GB for usage.One needs a launcher to use the phone effectively. Nova and Microsoft launcher works very well.The sound is loud, I've to keep the phone ringer at half, otherwise it is too loud. The audio playback sound level is handsome.I'm into videos big time. I keep watching videos and play games and the battery comfortably lasts for 24 hrs.Android P is long overdue.	4
12574	This is perfectly balanced product worth your koney	5
12575	Upgraded from3s to 6pro. Glad that i have chosen this one. Very happy and satisfied with this product.	5
12576	Some time heats after 30 min.	4
12577	All of above r very good	4
12578	Good looking device but heating problem while playing games like candy crush. Using mobile from last 7 days.	1
12579	Awesome glossy aluminium body, good battery backup, average charging speed, notch and bezel less display is too good, picture quality is good - but no 4k video and auto stabilising videos (would suggest to search in youtube how to stabilise video than your problem is solved for this issue) also the sound quality is average ( honor has done some cost cutting by putting an average speaker) but earphone/headphone sound output is good. Processor is excellent. Overall a good premium mobile phone.	5
12580	Battery is the only disadvantage of this phone	5
12581	Its phone is very short	4
12582	Nice 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻	5
12583	Nice product under the festival period	5
12584	first of all thanks LG for awesome display in mid range mobile....i am using this from last 48 hours and my initial impression is that if you are going to use this mobile for browsing,social media,movies and songs this is for you,not made for intense gaming,,,strictly no for heavy gamersphone is buttery smooth in day to day usage...rear cam is good but front cam disappoints,,selfie lovers will miss something in this department...to conclude.... decide wisely for what purpose you are going to buy a mobile...in my case it is basically for media consumption,its premium looks is an added advantage....i am quiet satisfied......	4
12585	IN THIS PRICE SEGMENT THIS IS UNBEATABLE PRODUCT..	5
12586	Forever this is my first review on Amazon and very disappointed with LG Q6.The phone is heating very frequently which is uncomfortable to hold in hands and to do basic things like calling or chatting.	1
12587	Awesome perfect amazing loved it	5
12588	Redmi Always Best Quality	5
12589	A	5
12590	Over all performance is good. Only disappointing is Speaker volume is very low.	3
12591	This is one of the worst experience i ever had with Mi. The battery doesn't last for more than 3 hrs with continuous usage. Worst battery life. Won't recommend to buy this cellphone.	1
12592	Amazing display!!!!!Battery would last for around 12 hrs with normal browing and video/song usageFace recognition doesn't work most of the time even if you try to improve at various brightness levels	4
12593	Awesome phone go for it. Best in class picture and sound quality.	5
12594	"I am a fan of compact size phones. so I had very few options with 5"" screen size. iPhone was not in my budget.I was quite confused with its size(5.8 inches), saw too many phones those having size in between 5.5 to 6 and found very bulky. then I get a hands-on with Samsung s8 (similar screen size). I searched size comparison in YouTube but nothing helped.finally I took the risk and ordered, and guess what it is exactly what I was looking for. 1. extreme handy and compact.2. camera is qui...READ MORE"	5
12595	Please don't buy this product	1
12596	Camera quality worstBatter life is less than a dayPhone over weightTouch is not goodAlso hang sometimes	1
12597	I want my invoice for this product	5
12598	Poor screen quality, just broke in a month with a fall from my bed to floor about a distance of less than a meter. Replacement not accepted. Poor service	1
12599	EXCELLENT PHONE WITH GOOD CONFIGURATION AT REASONABLE PRICE.	5
12600	Wow nice alternative for expensive phones.  Gives the same feel of an I phone .	5
12601	Excellent batterylife	5
12602	Average phone, Display, camera quality is not good. It is not upto the redmi branded mark & bit expensive.	3
12603	Using Honor 8X for past 1 week.Nice design. Excellent picture quality for this price range. Getting 2 days of backup. No complaints about battery. No lag while gaming...played pubg and pes for a long time. Kirin 710 did a good job. Camera quality performs well at outdoor lighting conditions.Cons: Sound amplification is not loudFront camera flash missingNo fast charging	5
12604	Mobile display nd battery backup is awesome but fast charging feature missing	5
12605	Amazing performance of the lg..RUSHABH	5
12606	To start with, the phone looks is good. Brilliant packaging. But once you start using the phone,  it will hang offen. Battery is average (one day or less), that is expected with 3000 Mah battery. Camera is average, outdoor photo is still OK but in low light, the photo is pathetic, above all, the price is ridiculously high, I got it for 16200.Avoid buying this phone as it fall short of nokia' reputation and waste of money, as this phone hangs every other seconds.	1
12607	Picture and sound quality is good but battery is draining too fast	5
12608	Touch is not good, other wise good	3
12609	It's very good phone	5
12610	Picture Quality - the primary camera (back side) is very good. However the selfie camera (front side) is not a stellar performer, its average.Sound quality - its very good but somehow it could have been better.Battery Life - Simply the best in this segment. Its has a huge battery and with average usage it can last 2 days. However since this battery is huge it adds to the weight if the phone.	5
12611	a	5
12612	Small in size	1
12613	Superb screen quality UI. Very light weight. Nice camera.	5
12614	Good processor handles apps and downloads , online streaming with ease. Only issue I found was looses connectivity very often could be due to service provider issue but then didn't had the problem with earlier phone used at work and at home...	4
12615	To be perfect at this price	5
12616	OTG not getting inserted and connected properly. My SanDisk OTG was easy to use on Redmi 3,4,5 series.	3
12617	Picture quality is poor. Sound is good. Battery is decent. But price is high.	3
12618	It's very amazing experience I love it that product. Looks superb display is also cool	5
12619	I will go to pros and cons directly.Pros:Design is good.Display is crisp.Battery is good stays for one whole day with mid to heavy usage.Sound is great.Performance is good if not the best but serves the purpose with out lags.Cons:Camera is average or less, not for some one who is looking for good camera phone.Price is too high 14K is too much I got it in launch offer at 10K still feel not worth the money.	4
12620	I don't like this mobile. Camera is not good ..Picture is no clarity in hd display for this mobile	3
12621	in description Mi A2 Camera is 20 MP but its not give quality like 20 MP. overall i m not satisfied with mi A2 20 MP camera i also update my all apps and system update but still its not give quality like 20 MP.also internet is not working with Mobile network only internet working with wifi..i m digging what more problems in this phone...	1
12622	Well performance	4
12623	Full version of display better life is excellent camera workvery good Android 7.1	5
12624	The Honor 8x is a great Device, but the only major con is Its Camera. It doesn't Have EIS and front Camera is Horrible. Not a bad device, but it's Camera is Bad. Back Camera is Great, but if you take a lot of selfies, this device is not for you.	5

12672	Ordered it got on time delivery awesome mobile in its price camera is best as compared to mi note 6 Pro sound quality is best battery is also good I will recommend to go for this phone	5
12673	Do not buy. It takes 2 hours for full charge. If you keep using it continuously, you need to charge the phone twice. Even if the phone supports quick charging, they do not give the charger that supports quick charging. You need to buy one separately., Phone heats up very fast. I even noticed distorted lines that appeared on the camera when I was trying to click some pictures on back camera mode. Note 5 pro is a better option	2
12674	Slow and hanging in this phone. Many app automatically stop .	3
12675	No problem with performance it's just too much bulky	2

12693	The phone is awesome.  The battery life is good.  1day standby.  Rear camera is also pretty more better.  Only disadvantage is the front facing camera is bitter here.	5
12694	The phone in general is definitely value for money. However if you are online all day long, its better to order a powerbank too. The battery has been the only disappointment.	4
12695	Awesome phone....	5
12696	They are saying that half of the charging done in 30 min, but forgot to say about discharge. It has a feature of Turbo Charger and Turbo Discharger.Battery Backup is not good, almost discharging with in 8-10 hours. Not for net users.	3

12709	Better than Oppo and Vivo. It has absolutely amazing display and functions. Awesome mobile 👌🏻	4
12710	Nice phone from Samsung as expected.. loved it Being Samsung user.. but price seems bit higher.. Please work on price	5
12711	LG seems to have poor quality control. Except for the display nothing is satisfactory about this phone.	2
12712	Everything is good, but the only thing i don't like is that there is not 3.5mm jack. Its very irritating using the C type cable connector for headphone. Sometimes the cable getting cut, we have to be very careful in using headphone.	4
12713	This phone is worth the price	5
12714	Battery is so...... Less backing	4
12715	Camera is not at the best...headset missing in the pack...sound quality is at its best	3

12736	Sometimes touchscreen not responsive	3
12737	The display and touch is flawless. The design is innovative. Camera is average. No fingerprint sensor. It has certified US military standard 801G.Every phone has a pros and cons, you can't buy a perfect phone in this pricesegment. If you are looking for a quality phone then lg q6 is the best choice.And last but not the least it is MADE IN INDIA.	4
12738	I recieved the product. Its good looking and good touch, but their wifi connection was not working properly.  Check it properly.	2
12739	I would say the most stylish phone ever I have hold so far. Excellend design- no comparison. I can't take my hands off to on serios nomte. Wide display but easily accessible. Software part is also excelent. 3 drawbacks. one is Camera. IT takes good images but looks like filters. Detailing missing, Second is Image stabilizer missing. video recording looks shaky. Third Battery life is average but it gets charged fast in 2 hours. And yeah, Speaker is average sometime i face difficulty in hearing but in this price- most stylish phone ever	4

12751	Believe me guys you wont regret. It's display even beats iphone or other in segment. LG has done a brilliant job making such phone in affordable price.ProsPremium displaySmooth performerFrom a good company (Hate Chinese)MADE IN INDIAAwesome Deal of cashback and exchangeCan make jealous of people who have taken different phonesConsNot much options for tempered glass or back coverFeels slightly slipperyMay be camera (not tested thoroughly, will rese rve my opinion)	5
12752	Best value of money	5
12753	Looks nice in the red color and notch display, could have a better and updated chipset atleast a snapdragon 635, sound quality is average otherwise a good mobile in rest of the aspects. Deal on Amazon was 5% instant discount on using HDFC cards but I did not get the discount- upon checking with customer service they mentioned it’s applicable only for some EMI - felt cheated and probably could have bought it through mi directly or Flipkart which had better deal!	4
12754	Nice product quality.worth of money. Moderate picture , also sound quality  is good.little bit heating issue.. other wise good product.	5
12755	This phone is a power pack of design, built quality,camera, battery ,value for money etc,If you love to shoot a video then this phone is not for you, lacks IES stabilisation, video quality is good but it shakes alot which is not suitable for video recording. But stationary video recording is OK.Other than this,  the body made of glass which can be easily broken once you drop or fall down incase.	4

12760	In calling some time voice getting slow... Not clear voice... Problem in talking...	1
12761	Better go for Honor Play	4
12762	One of the Best in this Class. I Liked it. Sound Quality Should Improve. Picture Quality & Battery life Average. Their is no Direct Video Calling from Contacts, Huawei Should add this Features in next Update of Software. No Flash in Front. Overall it is Good.	4
12763	Nice product & value for money phone in the megment...!!!	5
12764	Except the display, it's not a good phone, in all other aspects. Waste of money	1

12772	Have been using it since a month, and the phone is performing well. Good picture quality, battery life and does not heat up quickly.Only thing that could've been better is the sound, which should be louder.Camera is enough for an average user.Overall, a great phone !	4
12773	The Redmi 6 pro comes with excellent features as all are mentioned in the website.Firstly thanks to amazon to deliver the product within 2 days.Secondly MIUI 10 interface is awesome.It is not possible to explain here without using it practically.Thirdly screen split option allow users to use multiple applications simultaneously which is an awesome experience.Fourthly face unlock feature can sence your face almost in a dark environment.But two important things are needs to be addressed that future buyers of this phone should be concerned about,1. Picture quality of front camera as not good as website claims.2. No OTG cable is provided by mi. User needs to buy it separately.	5
12774	Its my first time reviewing a phone.1.battery;its good enough but not ty o the mark but if ur not a gamer then its enough for u.2.picture:not good at night3:sound :loud enough but not to the markOver all ita a good phone am satisfied enough tks amazon. And tks honor	4
12775	Worst mobile i ever used. Getting hang in first week of use only. After 20 days its automatically getting switched off and unable to on. Very slow mobile. Now going to Mi store to check issue.	1
12776	A good value for money smart phone in this range with amazing features, beautiful display, dual toned body gives a very premium look, light in weight and yes, amazing performance overall.Camera performance is also good with AI feature giving you a different user experience.Battery performance is excellent even if you put your phone on video steaming for about 6 to 7 hours, and still use the rest battery for your regular activities.	5

12786	Awesome....	5
12787	Average phone .. okay product only.. I was using vivo before this , I feel camera quality was better than A2.A2 camera quality is below average.OS and performance wise it's pretty descent.On an average use like just browsing listening songs and other stuff I will get definitely one day.When it's come to gaming I play only pubg. And battery drains fast . And you have to charge by 6-7 pm . If you are a average mobile users person and don't take pics . It's super phone for you. If gaming or camera it's not good for you.	3

12792	Battery life is good, last long for two days with normal usage.  Back camera is good, but front camera not up to the mark. In width wise this phone is 0.5 cm less compare to my previous redmi note 3. So it feels like a small phone.	4

12866	I saw some youtube unboxing videos of huawei p20 lite and in every video there was a rubber back cover bundled with the phone even huawei official says that they are giving a back cover with the phone but when i received the phone, there was nothing like that. Please do provide all the items which company is promising to have in the box.	4
12867	Not good productHanging problem	2
12868	I have been using this mobile from last 10days there is a high definition screen as well as the performance of this mobile was really surprising me that how the red mi got this awesome product really thnks for Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro for giving this awesome product to us, Coming to Camera ?? it has dual rear camera inbuilt as well as front camera was Also feels better in this price segment coming to performence I already using PUBG game with no lags as well as I already installed so many apps in this mobile but there is no lags and no hesitation to switch apps .	5
12869	Review it later after i have used it for a month.	5
12870	Touches are insensitive many a times.While playing games like PUBG or mini militia, the touches are just pathetic. Need to tap 2-3 times to get it working. Maps just don't expand or contract in one go. Randomly changes direction many a times.I received it last night and have barely used it for 6 hours as of now but it has managed to hang once (while i was using 3-4 applications only in the background...although the hand time was very small -2 seconds but still don't expect it to hang on day 1 itself)When i go to settings and try to search for a setting in the 'Search' field, the keyboard just doesn't show up. So, I can't type anything.I barely use Camera feature, but somehow feel that the Camera doesn't take good quality pictures.NO RETURN option is here. I would be happy to buy even a more expensive phone if this would be returned. For the first time, Amazon has disappointed me !	1
12871	Camera quality is very bad and sound is very low , phone look is super	3
12872	Don't believe on negative  reviews just experience it..!!!	5

12877	Wonderful phone with all power packed features at a very reasonable price.	4
12878	Product is good but Amazon pay balance cashback not received. I was cheated by both Amazon and Honor.For the same product I had to pay more money.	1

12901	All Things are very good 😍💯	5
12902	A comprehensive review after 3 days use: This is a good and robust phone from LG and is meant for moderate to heavy multitaskers.Pros:Offcourse, the full vision display is a pleasure to eyes with Full HD display. It does miss out on 2K resolution of G6 but then der is bound to be a difference if the cost difference is 25000.Excellent connectivity. I stay on a first floor and had connectivity issues in Redmi Note 3 so much so that, I was not able to to use 4G even with 2 sticks on board. With this phone i was surprised that the network sticks are still 1 or 2, but there is no call drops and 4G just works amazingly well without any buffering. Simply superb. Excellent Volte support.Excellent Wifi connectivity compared to that of Mi Note 3.Premium looks & Super dimensions - Can be operated using single hand and have a premium feel to the same.Rear camera - Excellent color reproduction and daytime performance. Low light photographs also good only second to Samsung Flagship f1.7 aperture lens. Autofocus is good and have multiple modes for instant feedback of photos.Solid Build - Gives more confidence while carrying and surprisingly light weight. Feels like carrying 5th gen iphones in terms of weight and dimensions.OS is very responsive with negligible lags.Gaming performance also very good without any lags. Played temple run and asphalt 8.Facial recognition also excellent. Initially you will feel as if its not working. It will take some time for you to actually guage the distance and the way the phone needs to be raised to trigger the same. Once done, its a charm with the sensor working as fast as a fingerprint sensor. so actually not missing the fingerprint sensor.Dedicated Micro SD card slot with dual 4G standby Sim. Changeover from one sim to another by a click - Awesome feature for a dual sim user. Smart forward feature which will not let u miss ur calls on other sim while u r engaged on one sim.Good speakers. Voice is not loud as that of lenovo / redmi note 3, but is loud enough to be heard properly and clarity is very good.The cons: The phone has its own set of cons as well:Average front camera. But better than my redmi note 3 or lenovo k4.No LED flash for front cam.Average battery performance. Approximately not more that 6 hours of screen time on Wifi. With cellular data it may be even less. Didnt test the same. You do have a battery saver mode which restricts the background apps. But dont know how effective that would be. Its claims to be 20-30% more energy efficient. with moderate usage i am getting around 11 hours of battery backup with around 3 hours of total screen time. This is the only major problem i have come across. redmi note 3 used to give almost 16-17 hrs of backup with a similar usage.No Quick / Fast / Dash charge. A big letdown given the rate of battery consumption.Heating issue - yes there is a bit of heating issue with this phone. I experienced the same while i was restoring my old phone data. to state the facts correctly, its was 560 Mb of data download with 146 apps being installed simultaneously. Along with the same, i was also testing camera and gaming performance as well. Believe me the phone was still working with charm without any lag issues, but yes it heated. But by heating it doesnt mean it will burn your hands. It will be in the range of 43-48 degrees, only so much that the you will fee the change in temperature.Proximity sensor not in sync while on call. It fails to switch off the display even if you r using the earpiece resulting in more battery consumption. Dont know if i need to change some settings.No inbuilt dual app feature. have to install parallel space for the same.My opinion is that if looks, built quality, camera and multitasking is your priority, this is probably the best phone available at this budget that too coming from a premium brand like LG. this phone will be a letdown for only those who need more power backup on a single charge, but again the same could be managed by having a spare power bank or a car charger.	4
12903	Excellent build quality, camera is also good, night mood is not so good. but in day light is awesome.no lags, battery is also good.	4
12904	Native video calling features is missing otherwise nice product.	4

12922	Photos in low light were extremely bad	4
12923	The pictures are AMAZING. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. And for a battery this size, it lasts me at least 24 hours everyday on full use. This is the smoothest and most beautiful Android experience I've had to date. Build quality is also perfect. Oh just for reference I'm moving from LG and before that was Samsung	5
12924	Battery backup not up to mark	5
12925	For the said product I paid through Hdfc credit card. Ideally I should get a discount obra 999/_ but instead of discount ...it additionally debited rs 1000/_	1
12926	Gud for the price value , camera is better than Mi note5pro , gud in sound quality , I updated to the new version'pie' it is owsm	5

12932	Phone is very good. Go for 6gb version. Monthly security update. Android pie starts rolling out. Stock Android. Good camera. Descent sound quality and Moderate battery life. Overall good product.	5
12933	The ringtone sometimes sound garbled. Not sure where this sound issue lies. Amazon did not allow any EMI offers at the time of checkout despite mentioning this offer info. The price of this phone came down by 2k after just 2 weeks of my purchase. As far as offers are concerned, Amazon isn't a good choice.	3

13018	During the experience of using dual sim... Despite of full network coverage sim 2 fails to work almost 90% my sim 2 is out of reach. However there is no issues on network.Very disappointed. I can't return this phone as I am using this now at Nepal. Sad sad sad.... :-(😢	1
13019	The display was awesome. The processor doest not support the heavy gamings. For  moderate user's, it works fine	5

13028	📷 very gd, battery very bad	4
13029	Slow processor,looks good battery charging time more it should be less than 10k then worth it	2
13030	Budget phone worth for 15000..camera is very clear and well	5

13032	Everything is good but only one speaker working that was not good	5

13037	Good product with grt battery life	4
13038	Totall okk phone	5
13039	Not satisfied with the Google Android software...if you have used mi phone in past and willing to buy this... Then this is your bad option...As they lack from lots of options which miu9 has...More over there is no fm, Battery backup, memory card option and lots of Google apps... Which mostly we won't use...This phone is something same like jelly Bean or Ginger software...Only they have focused on camera and gaming performance for RAM and Rom..Don't make a mistake like I did...It's better you move for mi note or pro..	1
13040	Better picture quality, but small screen size	5
13041	Stunning performance with the phone on multitasking, playing games and watching movies. The display is quite brilliant and the notch display is quite stylish.Go for it where the performance matters at this budget, when it comes to camera with AI sensors, its adjusting the picture as required, quite amazing.	5
13042	Osm look this mobile . Full hd screen and i like mobile features..	5
13043	Nice phone......but camera quality is not good in low light.	4
13044	The First thing I would like to mention is About the Price Factor,it's Unsatisfactory.The MRP of this product is high by 1500 RS.About Camera - it's little More than Average.About Performance- SD625 is Slow compared to SD636 and Average for this Price. Display- Smooth,Attractive and Best. Notch- I think it's just for name because Notch and it's functions Doesn't Seems Real. Battery- Super Awesome and Best. Make your Decision to go for it or not.	4
13045	Considering the price range, I would say this is one of the best mobile. I have been a user of the most premium phones in market till date since last 14 yrs. But this phone didn't disappoint me. Display, camera, processor and battery all complement its amount. Only improvement which I would suggest is that the UI can be more smooth like Samsung devices. The product received was in very good condition, credit to the seller.This device is 10K less than Vivo V11 pro and Oppo F9 pro, but after comparing all features I would suggest to buy Honor 8x and save 10K.	4
13046	Front and rear Camaras not working from 3rd November2018. I tried throgh restore factory setting. But i couldn't rectify the problem. I want replacement. Kindly i request you to replace the same mobile.	1
13047	Just go for it. I bought 6GB 64GB variant. Just superb one to use. Excellent Fullscreen display. Best Camera. No second thought just buy it. You ll love this phone.	5
13048	Just got the phone, and it got heated up so badly while setting up the account. This phone got a serious heating issue	2
13049	LG Q6 is a best phone in this price, very compact to use single hand, full hd display in this price value for money.	5
13050	Picture quality ✌️✌️✌️	5
13051	Value for money. Budget all rounder.	5
13052	really awesome product frm Nokia But camera is not upto the mark	5
13053	Moto G6 is a good sturdy phone but priced higher as at this price better mobiles with better features are available.	3
13054	I think xiaomi thought customers are now mad for there smartphone so give them anything. Over all it was very bad experience.Cons-1.display color was faded and white2.camera is completely rubbish3.design was also rubbish and very thicker4.lags and heating issue	1
13055	Beautiful phone for me AI camera is excellent but front blur is not good	5

13061	Having heating issues.Sound is not good as note 5 pro.Camera quality also not good.Only thing is notch display, better go for note 5 or if u have enough budget note 5 pro will be far better than this.	3
13062	My First Hand On Impressive is OSMPhone look so premium and So Bright And Superb screen in this price range.....Littile bit Disappointed bcos no Fingerprint In this Price Segment.... But I m happy with pattern and Face UnlockFace Unlock not Quiek Fast in Night and low Light Condition....But Overall LG Q6 is Good...... LG UI is Much better then OPPO vivo..  UIRear Camera Is Good In Day light but Front camera I noticed not goood... 5MP front Camera but I m not take selfie too much... So I don't vare about this.  ......If u look for Brand Like LG... Go for this phone... If u r Need disply like 18:9 in full hd + go for itCompact size and Nice light weightBut If u looking for Great camera Phone then this phone not for u....	5

13071	"Review after 2 days use . I compared battery life with s7 edge, just normal everyday use calls , messages and slight browsing (no heating). It lasted near to s7 edge battery . Had heating issue while booting up for the first time , I had same issue in most of the phones. I went for this mobile for compact , big screen , stylish and ""durable"" design . I got what I wanted."	5

13092	3rd class mobile. CAMERA ,SOUND,BATTERY are 3rd class. plese dont buy this mobile go for MOTO or some other brand.	1
13093	Phone is good but it has some disadvantages like over heating when charging. Next is that, kindly have the phone with a screen protector at least. Unfortunalty my new phone fell from my hand and had to replace the LCD screen which was around 6.5K, if it had a good screen guard then I would have proected my mobile. Next thing is that sell only the valid screen guard too, purchased a new one but it didn't long even a day(it was a fake screen protector). Overall I am not so happy with the phone.	3
13094	A nice device to select from Honor series.You can surely go with the New Honor 8x- The Beast In Kind Gadget.*Be careful in caring the mobile as it will be big in our hands....*Firstly, we should get a best or better mobile case for it in order to avoid accidental breakages and damages as it will be somewhat difficult to hold it all the times perfectly...Picture Quality:Rear Cmaera:The rear camera 📸 performance has to be upgraded as it is executing a layer of blur and pixel break in the images..But we can overcome it by changing the camera and picture settings or even change to aperture mode and pro mode.Note:- 1. In order to Keep the focus in a right place, and to avoid picture blur and out of focus elements, keep an eye on the exact place to keep the object or the person in the correct place and avoid zooming the lens instead move the device to get close or far from the object.2. Always Touch on the screen to detect the focus on the object or on the person to be shooter.3. Don't go for bokeh mode(so how better for selfies and the front camera) and AI Preferences for all the types of images you are capturing as it gives you an unpleasant and negative thought on the camera.. Instead check whether you are in need to use them or not..4. Always avoid using beauty level to get good and natural stuff.5. Better to prefer Pro mode and manually select the parameters to get good and quite awesome pictures.Front Camera:The front camera is designed with 16MP Megapixel with good support of bokeh effect. Good among all the competitive range of devices.Sound Quality: It's atmost a good experience for the sound quality perspective but sometimes, in my personal opinion and feelings, I heard the audio of the media files and songs as a base volume which we observe in a closed room or a small closed areas.Battery Life: It is quite enough for the users but as we are basically humans don't agree with what we have but expect a lot beyond the presence..	4

13102	Build quality is excellent. Screen is crisp and bright. Cameras are not as bad as some are claiming. They are quite good really. sound output both through headphone jack and speakers is best in class possibly. However, there is one disappointing factor. I bought this mobile as Flipkart page showed that it has Android Pie update. As per my experience, out of the box, IT STILL COMES WITH ANDROID OREO, NOT PIE. On checking updates, I found no updates available. It is still running the September ...READ MORE	4

13121	Front camera is good.. Rear camera does good only under good light.. Its not that good even under flash.. Battery life is good. Phone performance and look is awesome	3
13122	It has been 1 month since I bought this product and this product is amazing, if you are looking for a new mobile under 15k you must go for it .. camera quality is very good, Slim glass body is very attractive. delivery was little delayed.I am enjoying this one	4
13123	Budget and performance, combination of both. 1 have avg 100 android apps from the past 3 years and used the same in the this device, performance is really good, only lacks battery function.	5
13124	Reviewing the Mi A2 after 1 month of intensive usage.PROS- Build Quality is pretty good. The metal back makes it slippery but also more durable than the glass used on some phones. Personally, I feel glass is justified only if the phone has wireless charging. So the metal body is definitely an advantage.- Software is clean without any bloatware. Android One means that updates happen on regular basis.- Performance is buttery smooth. Snapdragon 660 is an able chipset and I did not notice any lag. I have the 6 GB + 128 GB variant. Storage is enough for me. Memory management is also pretty good on the unit I got.- Camera is a real highlight. The secondary 20 MP sensor is a real improvement in low light conditions. It brightens the images considerably although some noise is present. Daylight shots are very pleasing. You can argue the Poco F1 has similarly good camera but it Mi A2 wins the low light game by a fair margin. Selfie camera is also pretty good, offering a lot of detail and portrait mode with software.- Speaker is mono but really loud.CONS- Battery life is the only con I could find. I get a screen on time of about 4.5 hours with moderate usage. The provided charging brick can charge the phone in less than 1.5 hours. It would have been better if they included a QuickCharge 4.0 brick also.P.S. Lack of headphone jack as a con varies from user to user. I use wireless earphones. USB type C to 3.5mm converter is included, but if you have a habit of losing small cables, then it may be an issue for you.FINGERPRINT SENSOR BUGThis bug has affected many devices. All cores remain at full throttle and reduces battery life. I tested this on my unit and fortunately, this does not have such an issue. My unit uses FPR sensor. Users with Goodix sensor have complained of this bug. To find out what sensor you have, insert  * # * # 64663 # * # *Concluding, the Poco F1 may look like a better value for money proposition, and it may be for some people. I am fan of Stock Android experience and found that several features of the Poco F1 are unrefined. The cameras are also slightly better on Mi A2. So if you are looking for a performance all-rounder with great set of cameras, I feel Mi A2 should be your first choice below 20k.	5
13125	Good product and good battery lifeShoft case	5
13126	I don't got earphone	1
13127	Sweet and Short review:The best thing about this phone is its Display, great colors, and superb quality. Overall its a decent phone great to use. Platinum color looks and feels premium to useDownside: Poor camera and low battery backup.The battery will last for 6-7hrs with normal usage and 4-5hrs with heavy usage and it takes 2hrs or more to get it fully charged. Others phone in similar or lower price range have got better camera quality than this.Overall if you are looking for a secondary phone that looks good and you are just gonna use it for calling, go for it.Won`t recommend it for primary use.	3

13141	This is a perfect value for money, though I considered Motorola One also I finally decided on this one and I am glad😍. The phone is smooth till now, except when you connect to Android Auto in a car🤨	5

13147	Picture quality is super. Sounds is good as expected battery life still good.Thanks	5
13148	The deal at offered price was appealing.	4
13149	Not as expected.Basically screen width is short but operational by one hand. Notch is not working while playing videos which is very bad experience.Finally not attractive as expected	3
13150	Posting this after using for 2 days:The phone looks amazing and is very light as well , it has a quick charger too.But when it comes to the performance, I didn't like the phone at all .The camera is too poor to capture any bokeh pictures. The images are bright but or very low quality and the camera behaves weird, sometimes it doesn't apply to bokeh effect though u select it manually while taking pics.Not a deal worth the price for sirr, there are many other phones in the market which are far better in terms of performance.And if at all the camera captures a bokeh picture, their algorithm is too bad, it looks like a poorly edit pic in which background has been blurred forcefully (blurring the subject in Focus as well)I don't know what are they selling at this price when the camera itself is too poor.Just the looks for 20k ??I thought might be an issue with my device and got in touch with their support team , they told few settings and reset.... Still of no use .... It's still the same ...of no worth.Wasted my 20k.	1
13151	Camera, ok but slow, over saturated.... Infact almost all apps run really slow. Multi tasking is pain.Sound, voice is fineScreen is great. Touch is not sensitive enough. Other mid tiers I have used could generally recognised even corner of nail. This is not capable of doing that. Needs some figure pressure.Finger print sensor is great, face reg is flawed n again slow...I regret buying it....	2

13183	Display quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too. Touch smoothness is amazing. I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.The USB is not type C, it is the old one. This is the only con that i found till now. It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.	5

Also your have to charge it at least  twice in a day and if you are travelling then it is a serious concerned. So it is not recommended to buy this mobile phone.	2

13234	Very good product. Worth buying.	4
13235	If you are looking for this exact specs, then this phone is the right one for you.Why I am satisfied with this phone?1. Light weight - 149g - Never liked heavy phones, they are so cheap. The heavier the phone the more cheaper are the components. With large screen craze, all manufacturers are totally milking this advantage.2. Device width 69mm - Very easy to hold and with its light weight, you can hold it with one hand and use it for longer time with out any pain in the fingers or palm (subjective to hand size)3. Corning gorilla - Never preferred using tampered glass or cover. I handle them safely, so corning will keep the screen scratch free for an year4. Nougat - Never updated the phone software since in most forums, users had mentioned about further battery drain on updating the device software.5. Display - Its bright with rich colors, good for one hand use with less bezel at the bottom. I prefer this to upcoming Q7 which copies the notch from iPhone X, which is so DUMB and unnecessary! This phone along with LG G6 with curved edges are the best displays you can get on the market now.What I am dissatisfied about?1. Back panel - Prone to scratches - Even though I keep it on a 3m cloth when i keep on the table, it still got scratches in just 20 days of usage from dust particles in my pocket.2. LG Apps - So dumb and numb with very less functionality, as I had to replace most of them.3. Camera - Not the best but its okay for enough, low light not that good though they provide some low light features4. Heat - Like other reviews, its true. Here in delhi, summer heat is already 41degs at daytime, so I am not sure what is causing such heat on the device, but I can feel more heat while charging. Though its nothing to fear about, since its military grade tested for temperature, but its quite annoying at hand given such high room temperatures.5. Battery drain - After moving from iPhone and Windows phone, i had expected poor standby time on Android but in this phone, with all the screen usage, it drains faster.Remedies I chose-1. Back panel - Though back panel is non removable, there are videos in youtube on how to remove it with few simple tools. And you can find back panel cover easily on google for 500 rupees. Got one of that to change it after 6 months.2. LG Apps - Replaced sms app with Sms organizer (by Microsoft), camera with other camera apps. Also looking for a good phone app with call recording features since it is not available in lg app3. Battery drain - I am always keeping the phone on 2G GSM mode (with idea sim in delhi), while using a Jio 4g portable wifi router to reduce battery drain. Now it easily stands for a day or two. Also making use of internal battery saver features to further sustain battery backup.4. Launcher - Using Microsoft launcher which is much better than the stock launcher in terms of functionalities and looks.	4
13236	Awesome phone. Despite 435 processor, response is amazing, Screen is really amazing which is the biggest + of this phone.	5
13237	The phone is awesome but have minor cons like front camera is not up to the mark and finger print sensor sometimes work slow. Excluding this the phone is working awesome everything is fantastic.	4
13238	It's a nice in this price range	5
13239	Good but not very good.	3
13240	A bit costly	4
13241	I like this mobile. Satisfied	5
13242	"After 7+ days of use..My first honor phn was 6x, 7x and now this one, 8x (wow)Amazing premium look and build quality which has now become hallmark of Honor devices. But the biggest problem this time is glass back, it really really slippery cant imagine using it without back case.. Also it attracts smudges, dirt and fingerprint like a magnet..But it is a big upgrade from 7x considering the design, camera, display, battery(superb) and specially the way 8x uses the motion sensor, proximity sensor.. (pick up the ringing phn, volume will be lowered, place the near the ear while on the contact screen it will automatically make a call or answer the incoming call automatically, place the phn in front of your face it will automatically unlock and much more...)Sturdy performance Kirin 710 I think is much better than Sd 660 in all around performance..Call clarity, call volume, signal quality excellent..What a microphone, it detects ""Ok Google"" 5 meters distance from my home television(ads) with such a low volume (lol..)Dual 4g dual volte..Speaker loud enough..Earphone volume is little lowcompared to 7x with my Sony headset, quality is better though, now there is plenty of settings inside music player..Fingerprint sensor is lightning fast and amazingly accurate even with lightestpossible touch..Face unlock doesn't have infrared camera to detect in thedark night but it works somehow by increasing the back light of the displayand it is pretty accurate when there is a bright background or wallpaperbut struggles with dark background otherwise face unlock is very fast andaccurate too..Battery is a big bump what i noticed it lasts around 2 days with light use and around 15 to 18 hrs on heavy use (4 hrs of youtube, half hour gaming, 2 hr calling, etc) also i found around 9 hrs of screen on time.. Impressive!!Charging time is another surprising element fr me, 7x took around 150 minutes whereas it takes 100 to 110 mins only..Camera does not have any stabilisation, EIS or OIS(which isneither given in Nova 3) also it does not have 4K video recording.. Low light or artificial light photography is neither good nor bad..I like the camera hardware very much, it is way better than its predecessor but 7x used to over expose the images now 8x make it little over saturated.. Wish we will receive updates for camera software from Honor to make it the best camera phn among the competitors(Realme, Mi).. Camera is the segment where they have to pay utmost attention.. I would rate 7/10 to the camera..Everything else is top class..Overall its is an awesome phn around 15k, great VFM and 10% discount + 1000 cashback (effectively Rs.12500/-) is definitely is a loot..Thanks for your patience.."	5
13243	Except for the sound quality, I overall love this product! Wish it had a front flash though, they gave one in note 5 pro, then might as well could have given with this model! But love the way this phone functions and pubg works pretty smoothly on this, so it's a steal deal for me! ❤	5
13244	Very bad product comparing it's price.1 very poor back finish, highly sensitive to scratches.2 no fast charging.3 camera below average.4 when switched off and try to charge the phone, phone will gets automatically switched on very strange.5 very poor pathetic after sales service from LG	2
13245	Thank you Amazon for giving best exchange price for my old phone :)I got this phone for 7800 which is fair deal for this product but if you are planning to buy for 15K then won't make much sense.Lack of Finger print scanner and LED notification makes this phone outdated.I can see many of them impressed with this phone due to 18:9 infinity display, yep that's correct it will give premium look when you hold.Not sure but many of the videos shows lot of flickers which is annoying, Specially in Youtube.Camera is not impressive, you can see lot of noises in the picture.Back is made of plastic which is easily get scratch.Overall -  an average phone with premium look, I am happy i got it under 8K but paying more than 8K would not make sense for this product.	3
13246	Very nice picture quality & sounds also,but batary life is small.	4
13247	i bought redmi 6 pro 3/32 with exchenge my redmi note 3 whitch exchange price is 4498 i total pay 5860 for this device. my review after use two days.  display quality is very poor all the pixel are shown saprate.camera is also bad not satified with both camera front and back shutter speed is very slow picture quality is very poor overall i give only 2 stars out of five only battery is good. not value for moneyand speed is also very poor perfomance is not goo.	1
13248	Display color pixels som change better	2
13249	heating issue, battery discharges very quickly. but display is great.	3
13250	Very good product... picture quality very good...sound quality very nice...must bye it...	5
13251	very bad mobile  i faced hardware problem within 1 week amazon replaced my device. but that another device also has hardware problem worst customer care no experience person in care centercharging issue mic issue motherboard issuei will never buy Motorola mobile in my life again	1
13252	Great display. Feels like 5.2 inch. Snapdragon 435 chipset is fast. RAM management is good. No bloatware except a couple of LG support apps. Battery lasts 12 hours with 4G in background the whole day and moderate use like browsing, YouTube, downloads and no games. Heating is pretty normal and you feel volume buttons are warm during video calls. Don't believe the battery sceptics out there. Face recognition is good if you can constantly improve it (with and without spectacles, earphones etc). Both camera performs it's job decently but not great. With a great camera and front flash this phone would've been a clear winner in mid-range. But LG has to wait until next iteration for that crown.	4
13253	Everthing is great	5
13254	Screen size is not bigger	4
13255	Nice model...Looking beautiful....Performance also good..But 11,000 worth front cam 5mp not google...	5
13256	Delivery speed is quite good but packing is very poor. Box has few dents over it and when i got the delivery the amazon wrap is a bit broken so i thought something fishy but the product is there hence makes me some relief. The Delivery package is the worst that i have ever seen.Coming to the product the mobile is looks damn stylish and Build quality is great at this price and esay in hands.Both Rear and Front Camera qulity in Indoor and Low light conditions is poor and it can be improved. Front Cam is even worse in Day light also.Except the package and cam quality the mobile worth the money.If you are a selfie lover then don't go for it	4
13257	In this range honor 8x give you avarage sound quality, and most importantly without stabilizing the picture mode AI camera goes to workless.... Otherwise good phone yr just go for it.	3
13258	Very good photo of if u have knowledge portrait, sound quality Is not very special when video is recorded... charging Is done once a day ..I stay at home and charge more otherwise I don't know if I carry out ...	5
13259	Nice phone a this price range	5
13260	Solid build. Awesome looks. But low battery life.	5
13261	I just loved the specs from the first time I saw it. I liked it's predecessor and this one is an upgrade. Btw I bought the glacier blue one and it's pretty good looking. Built quality is good too. And it's Android One 😊 one more point is the good cost efficient.	5
13262	Its Awesome,Perfect In All Types,Great Processor,Storage,Battery And Much More	5
13263	Smart and easy access, good phone; should provide earphones though... feels kind of incomplete without it.	5
13264	Sound quality of the ear piece is worst. I am getting a very very low call clarity and sometimes I can't hear anything. It is horrible in crowded areas.	3
13265	This is a good phone and price,  Camaro quality is good,	5
13266	Camera quality low but all  phone okk awesome	5
13267	I have purchased in june after seeing the performance I recommend 5 star	5
13268	This MI A2 is worst phone i ever used for following reasons.1. This phone has Low battery life. The company claim it to last at least one day but trust me the battery for new phone lasts not longer then 12 hours while using. Every night you sleep with alarm in your phone but you will wake up with switched off phone.2. There is no earphone jack. It means you can not talk on your phone using earphones and charger at the same time. Given the low battery life you need to apply charger more then your earphones. It is a bigest inconvenience in this phone. (PS..I didnt receive Any cable to connect phone with earphone so it caused me a higher inconvenience.)3. The screen brightness  is very low evenif you set at highest. It is very difficult to use it in Bright Day light. You have to find shade if you want to comfortably use the screen.4. You can not return this mobile because amazon will not let you do so. They claim 10 days return but this claim is a fake claim because when you go to return page of amazon website,it will make you talk to customer case. Customer care executive  will pressure you to apply for home visit of expert for mobile inspection for any fault. No eperson will come to visit you And you will end up biting your anger. (It is my latest experience)Conclusion is that.. If you r looking for a convenient and user friendly mobile withgood camera then dont go with this product . Only go if you want to buy a camera with stupid mobile features.For Amazon.. I am going to sue you for not providing me with Earphone connection Cabel, mobile cover and Sim ejection pin despite mentioning it in your product description .	1

13291	if battery backup was better.	4
13292	Totally disappointed with this product.. I hate you mi!	1
13293	Phone is good. But it should be compared with Xiaomi Redmi 5 or Xiaomi note 5. Comparing to that phone is ok.Price wise Xiaomi Redmi note 5 is 11000. Nokia price will be 11000+5500 which is what it is selling at. Are you ready to shell 1.5 times cost then go for it.Also Nokia 5.1 should be priced at around 11000 mark. With current price and mediated nobody will buy that phone. Don't even launch if price is 15000.For Redmi note 5 pro your actual competitor will be Nokia X6. This will be launched at price of Ard 20000 which is again 1.5 time cost.Nokia can give itself chance against Redmi note 5 pro by launching Nokia x5 with mediated at price of 15000 which is same as Xiaomi.Now the question is why you will buy Nokia 6. If Nokia x5 is launched.It's personal preference. If you like Snapdragon processor. 625 is similar in performance to 450 now.You can compare this phone with any phone powered by 450 also.Verdict phone is not bad at all. No one can match build quality of phone. Second I don't understand how they protect screen. Xiaomi also claims Gorilla glass but it disintegrate on ist fall. This will not break after 5 falls also. Performance wise 625 is not bad also until you are avid gamer. Otherwise performance is good.Back camera is also good. Front camera is ok. Everybody is taking about Xiaomi Redmi note 5 pro camera it isn't that great.Considering build quality and longevity of phone Nokia is great brand.Buy this one over Xiaomi Redmi note 5 pro any day.If you want better camera and processor then wait for Nokia 6.1 plus. It will cost 20500. But considering build quality it is worth the price.	4
13294	Got it in exchange with my 17months old Mi note 4 in a surprising price of 4999! Just loving this phone..	5
13295	Firstly special thanks to Amazon for very fast delivery only in 22 hour. And In this range mobile is so good. And camera quality and sound is very good. I like it's handy size. Overall good	4
13296	Battery backup is horrible. Type c to 3.5mm jack. This could have been much better like POCO.	3
13297	Nice mobileSound is goodBattery almost good	5
13298	Very Good Budget Phones.	5
13299	Battery quality medium.. No video call options..	3
13300	The best ever device from Samsung. Simply a wow kind of stuff. The most Attractive thing is the camera no other brand can compete with On8's Camera. Keep it up SamsungREAD MORE	5
13301	So silm and soft looking goodOk	5
13302	I tried so hard to get this phone with the flash sale but my network at home was slower than my demand. I then noticed that I had to pay to be a Prime Amazon member and got it in a day. Hope this happens for all products.Then and only then, I give you a 5 star.But overall, good experience.	4

13312	The phone is awesome than I expected. As usual honor proved his camera processor battery. Best buy below 15k. The 6.5 inch display makes the phone look costlier.	5
13313	Worst cameraDon't buy this for cameraBattery life is goodMany best mobiles are available at this price	2
13314	Very satisfied with mobail	5
13315	Best mobile phone in this price range , feel like a flagship phone...Camera quality is awesome, no one can beat  this phone .... infact under 25K no one can beat this phone in camera field front and back camera both are awesome and auto focusing is very fast...Battery life is this phone little bit disappointed me ..but it gave me one day power with mix uses..Performance is also good but some problem in proximity sensor but this is not a big issue it can be fix with OTA update...Speaker outpout is too good, overall this phone is best value for money ...If you want better camera and suberb performance then go ahead....👍	5
13316	Good mobile.. Professionalist never say dont like LG brand products ...	5
13317	Battery life is best...If you are expecting a great camera this might disappoint you ...There is no issue with the software and performance	4
13318	Very chepst mobile poor condition, not stasifed this mobile phone, overeat very bad in battery don't West your money	1
13319	The phone is great for its price and the piece i recieved works flawlessly. I want to especially state that the display, which is the highlight of this phone, is brilliant.One thing i have noticed is that the audio on this device focuses more on the mids of the frequency sspectrum, i.e. vocals. This might be a plus as far as voice calls are concerned, but as a person who likes listening to music on his phone, this is quite a drawback. It just takes away from the richness and dynamics of the music.I am no audiophile but this trait of the phone is quite visible. Perhaps you should consider a different phone if music is a priority.Also keep in mind that, like with most LG phones, it is almost impossible to install a tempered glass on the screen perfectly. There will always be a few air bubbles towards the edges of the installed glass which can look ugly.	3
13320	Sound is not that good	5
13321	Upgraded to honor 8x from honor 6x.. Wanted a large display.. Phone is stunning.. Excellent display, good camera, good sound, good battery, no heating issues.. No need to buy screen guard or phone cover.. Given in the box.. Finger print and face unlock is good and fast.. Overall must buy.. No earphones provided only con..	5
13322	One more good product of samsung	5
13323	I have given four stars just because this phone lags in some key areas:1- No Gorilla glass protection2- This phone's performance is just average, as Huawei has provided a moderate processor i.e. kirin 659, even in the price range of Rs. 20000. Whereas competitors are providing much powerful processor SD 636, even in lower price.3- Pathetic ear phones4- No back coverElse, everything apart from above points is good.	4
13324	Good product!! worth for money ..Camera quality is not that great and battery drains upon usage ofcellphone overall rating 4	4
13325	Moto g very bed quilty phone never purchased again Moto phone s	1
13326	Best phone to buys under ₹15000. Best all rounder and  true value for money.Day light camera performance is prity awesome but If you can manage with below par low light camera performance then buy it without any doubt. Audio from the speaker phone is average and battery performance is prity good as it runs for whole day with heavy usage. Absolutely no issues with any kind of connectivity. Display is fantastic. Look and feel is super premium.	5
13327	It is better to bought real me instead of this	3
13328	Good in prices	4
13329	"It's a disaster. Motorola is a well known brand, but not living up to its standards. Camera is very slow in operation. Picture quality is just ok for it's price  range. The ads of it's features is blown out of proportion. ""Just in one month usage the mic is NOT working"" how on Earth to make calls ? Also, it's a mistake to buy on Amazon as it doesn't support the return of the product, though it gives a highlight of 1 year manufacturer warranty: then why not taking the RESPONSIBILITY of Customer service? Just selling product to make money is not business.. at least I would not expect it from Amazon."	1

13343	"I am using iPhone 7 plus and due to its infinity display, I bought this phone for curiiosity sake . I must say this this phone is marvellous. it has 5.5"" Full HD display but looks very handy and gives u fa eel good factor. So much customization is there that u never get bored. but who want pure android experience can instal google now launcher. Camera quality is good. It does n't has finger print sensor but till date I have n't used even on iPhone.Face recognition unlock works like charm even in low light. People say that back is made of plastic and get scratches easily but it happens with all the phones. So I got the back of phone matt laminated. I have put a 32gb memory card.Now I have given it to my kid and he has installed all the major games and they all work without any lag and looks fab.Buy it, you won't regret."	5
13344	I don't like the picture of this mobile... As compared to MI A1, the pictures of MI A2 is not so good. The depth or we can say the glow from this camera is not good as we expected as compared to MI A1. But front camera is good but it need to be perfect. So, I request to MI to fix all the problem by your update as early as possible.	4
13345	Better than note 5 pro.Here is quite improvement in low light photography.But it has no option to change camera aperture.it take photos only at a fixed aperture.if you love photography then i suggest to buy honor rather than mi. Otherwise best phn at this price.That's why i give you four star..	4
13346	picture quality is awesome so does the sound quality but only con is the battery life of the device though i have my g5+ turbo charger which charges my phone really fast.and sound quality via quality earpphone is good but currently in indian market there is no quality type c earphone is available right now except OP bullets but its over hyped earphone till now after 3 weeks of usgae experience is good.i didn't fave any issue with proximity sensor and yes i can live without notch there are so many videos available on you tube regarding the design of the device but its not at all bad i ahave applied gadgetshieldz skins on my device it gives thie phone a fresh look. but no fave unlock is available by default it is available via google smart lock within 2 wreks the device received the pie update much quicker than the other android one devices.	4
13347	Amazing display	5
13348	Battery backup for below one day only and memory slot is an great disadvantage for this mobile and picture quality is good	4
13349	Almost good .i.e. camera ,sound ,picture quality ..performance all are 5star but battery not sufficient ....	4
13350	I don't like this mobile.I want to change my mobilePlease help me	1
13351	Picture quality is good in natural light N in night mode too,Sound is pretty loud and clear video display is pretty good although it depends on print quality much but still screen displays good enoughThere is bit battery issue it stays alive for 1 day whole if you use recursively your mobile.Look is quiet good	5
13352	Replace policy means - Replace with same model, even not in 24 hours.Second screen is cut for speakers at top.Screen is less wide hence difficult to type.Control keys very small and wide on screen difficult to pressOverall poorest of all MI model. This with no usable return or replace with other model is killer blow on your pocket.Leving amazon and MI from today for electonics.	1
13353	Amazing for this budget	5
13354	The phone I bought during the big billion Festival offer. The phone overall is good at all aspects considering the range of price. The picture quality ok. I found not good when zoomed. Overall camera is good. Battery charge lasts easily whole day for regular use. Sons quality good but sometimes recipient complaints on voice break but may be network issue. I am satisfied.	4
13355	Simply superb phoneOne problem big size screen	5
13356	Redmi 6 pro is good smartphone but not beat note 5 pro	4

13363	Worst phone. Continuous hanging issue.	1
13364	Lagging a lot	1
13365	Except than display there is nothing gud about this device .worst camera slow mobile and nothing to talk about.	2
13366	Mobile quality is best	5
13367	Good phone 😀	5
13368	Phone is well built and updates are happening as per Android one programme. USB 3.0 helps in charging faster. Rear Camera bokeh is missing. Over all for 14k this phone has served it's purpose. Used it for around 3 months.	5
13369	Display is not good	1
13370	Picture Quality is amazing. Screen is very bright and all colours are displayed with perfection.Sound quality is mediocre.Battery Life is good. Lasts for 2 days on a single charge.MI UI is amazingly convenient to use.	5
13371	great buy	5
13372	10 times better than flipkart delevary service	5
13373	Best phone under the price segment	5
13374	Sound speaker phone distortion on receipt of phone call	1
13375	charger heating so much...	2
13376	No proper support. Don't buy mi products.For small fall, the display is gone.	2
13377	Phone is not working properly and it's speaker and mic is not working and by calling it has sound of beep through the speaker in calling and display is quite bad and it's only 20 days m using please return this item.	3
13378	Super model#best battery backup#best display#best cpu	5
13379	Decent product. Smooth. Camera is OK considering the price point. Battery life is awesome.	5
13380	Best phone in this price category. Only one problem is not we get regular updates..	5
13381	1st day didn't go well..... Had a issue in downloading apps and connecting to WiFi... Later did Google what would be the reason.... Then cleared cache and some inbuilt data...Later it started working.... Now working fine and phone speed, battery are good.	3
13382	Phone is good.but its front camera's protrait option don't work.i m suprised.i saw it has protrait mode on YouTube review..but i don't get.so i think it will be return	2
13383	Disappointing battery and screen brightness	3
13384	I am biggest fan for its battery life.	5
13385	Better go for other products	2
13386	Must buy.Best display.Good battery backup.Camera good on daylight.In night if image under the flashlight the good pic.Best than mi	5
13387	For those who are in confusion to buy this. My recommendation is yes. Awesome phone with lot of features to explore. Battery backup is better compared to other mobiles in this range. Camera is awesome. It is true that some times photos are over exposed but good thing is that, we can adjust that in editing options after taking photos.The feature I like most is, we can slide photos in gallery, slide down notification bar using fingerprint sensor and front (SCREEN) flash in complete low light is very useful.	5
13388	Really nice phone by Moto would recommend everyone at this price range	5
13389	supppppeeerrrr	5
13390	Just an upgrade from my peviius Redmi Note 4, nothing much new.Not complaining, thumbs up to the brand and this phone. Loving the. notch design,. screen resolution is more crispy. camera is decent and not perfect, though getting enough in a budget smart phone. with exchange it costed me 50% percent of the price, though in same price band, you can go for Asus Zen phone Max Pro 1, will be a better choice, better chipset, 6gb ram and great camera. bokeh or depth effect seems artificial and not something to look up in this model, hope to see some corrections in future updates. sound quality is fair enough and decent too. front camera lacks the punch, what i had in redmi note 4, still doable. no complaints for battery. feels way handy and lighter than the note 4, inspite of a bigger screen and similar battery.	5
13391	Worst model in model... Don't buy	2
13392	Smart phone Good one lg	5
13393	This was good product. Very slim and looking nice. And one more thing is battery backup is not good	5
13394	Nice mob	5
13395	DESIGN IS LOOKING MUCH SUPERB	5
13396	very bad front camera. Average back camera	3
13397	Good One But Not The Best, Considering it's Price, For exchange between 8k to 10k, worth buying. Only drawback is battery usage should be optimized.	4
13398	Nice us  display good betrey long time thanks mi /amezone	5
13399	Awesome picture quality.Happy with the product.	4
13400	Delivery speed is lighting fast.camera quality 9f the phone is outstanding.	5
13401	I like very things in this mobile handy good looking storage and quick access to any app.	5
13402	Very bad and defective product. Sim slots are not at all working. Return details are not at all mentioned correctly in the website.	1
13403	That's a perfect phone in this price range awesome battery backup network catching power and internet speed also but there is a problem in zoom a pop up open shown check your data settings.	5
13404	No doubt the product is the best as far as features and functionality is concerned. loved the camera, ui, sound clarity and other features but the major issue i have been facing in last 1 day ( i got this delivered day before yesterday evening and i am writing this post today at 12.35 pm) is that battery drains super fast. last evening i charged my phone at 7 pm to 100% and by the time it was 10 pm my phone battery was 43% and by one it was 5% (max i used the phone for whats app and making few calls). I dont know its a product fault or with device.ALSO THERE IS NO OPTION FOR REPLACEMENT, AMAZON ONLY PROVIDES WITH THE OPTION FOR RETURN. SO EVEN THOUGH I WANTED TO REPLACE, I HAD TO REQUEST FOR RETURN.	2
13405	Mobile phone is awsom.	5
13406	Not a good phone very camera is not goodBattery backup is very bad	2
13407	Product is hanging even with 4GB of Ram with low usage.Very Poor performance. Screen not visible at sunlight, Camera quality is too poor on focusing with no shutter lag.	1
13408	Sound and software are good but camera and battery are not so good. camera don't give feeling like as 12+20mp.	4
13409	The phone is very good or I would say outstanding. It far exceeded my expectations. Very much satisfied with the honor phone and services given by Amazon as they delivered the product on time with proper documentation like bill of the phone etc.	5
13410	Battery life is not good.  Balance is 1st class.	5
13411	Battery life good,Picture quality okaySound quality okay	5
13412	I buyed this phone in June 2018 but Huawei is not providing any updates of Emui 9 for p20 lite and honor 7x as well.. So please buy some other company phone which provides updates	2

13426	Reviewing after using for 2 monthsBattery is good, low light photography of front cam is bad, old processor 626 but good no hanging issue, at charging time it will heat , otherwise its OK	4
13427	Look.....is awsumm	5
13428	Getting device over heated quickly even for two minutes browse and camera use, also battery down within 4 hours of normal internet usages, really worst product from LG n amazon and also no option for return this worst phone in amazon app, if i buy from flipkart , I can easily return this bad phone n get a good one	1
13429	Exactly as described.	5
13430	One of the best screen out there.The aspect ratio is very well set.Everyone is a amazed by the look of it. Slim and can be used with one hand.Facial recognition also works well in light not good in low light.Camera is not upto the mark.Video stabilisation is very good.	4
13431	Everything is good but Poor Battery life 😢	3

13444	Sometimes touch is not working and need to restart. Choose some other model	3
13445	more features in less price. face unlock and fingerprints sensor is faster.	5
13446	Picture quality is good. Sound quality especially on speaker is pathetic. Battery life is awesome. Performance of the phone is good, but not as Note 5 pro.issues with in build softwares.	4
13447	The built quality of phone is good. But rest is pretty average. The display is below average and visibility in sunlight is very poor. Most importantly, the after sale service is pathetic in Delhi. I won't recommend buying Nokia phones till their support service improves.	1
13448	The phone is awesome and software is lightning fast. Hardware is also good.Best thing aboit this phone is sharp resolution.	4
13449	Picture quality is awesome.Sound is AwesomeBattery Works good for all dayLook is superb, overall phone is stunning beautifull	5

13455	In today's world of smartphone era .This is the best with its price	5
13456	IT'S a good phone under 15000 but SINGLE SPEAKER and CAMERA QUALITY is bummer. I hope they improve it by SOFTWARE UPDATE. BATTERY is fine enough to handle one day under HEAVY USAGE.  I	5

13459	most recommendedREAD MORE	4
13460	Not happy with size, display, keypad. It feels heavy too... Was expecting something better	1
13461	Nic product	5
13462	The camera performance was mind blowing... If you are a camera love this is the one you should buy for sure The performance is awesome than other mid range smartphones such as note 5 pro,Zenfone pro max m1 etc..., The battery performance is only a bit concern... It is just average... The display is very good than other phones...	5
13463	I've lost my note 5 pro, so review may compared with note 5 pro..this review is after using 4 months,i've unlocked ,installed bloat_free miui 10 rom,magisk ,v4a, Google cam.. ( so miui specific features and performance i wont review)CAMERA -3/5..front camera is worst ,no detailing ,softened pics most of time(beauty mode is off), low light performance is worst, even in evening light u cant take sharable photos.... (google camera mod doesn't work with front camera, so no comments)Rear camera- stock cam app- it takes good avg photos in daylight ,not stunning or eye catching through.Google cam mod- this makes entire world of difference through, the detailing lighting is great with gcam, Night vision also works great , portrait shots with gcam sometimes cant detect edges properly and only works with human object/faces ..(if u comfortable with unlocking rooting, go do it and install gcam mod, may void warranty through)Display - 4.5/5clearity is superb here. switching from note 5 pro, 6pro's display produces great colors, brightness levels are also upgraded.Notch-space around the notch is kind of useless ,it always shows network,battery and clock all the time, And doesn't show any notification icons,u have to drag notification drawer.BATTERY -4/5backup is great ,on normal usage easily last 1 and half day.Sound- 4/5loudspeaker /main speaker- sound is clear,somewhat deep, and has avg level of loudness, no problems here.Earpiece/incall speaker-its small speaker but i would say quality is great, loudness is also above average , speaker is upgraded here.Earphone Jack- sound amplifier for jack is great ,i've used sennheiser CX-213, ..( install V4A with well know profiles, root and unlocking required here)I wont recommend this device as it doesn't worth 11k, instead go for note 5 pro.	4
13464	battery perfomance is poor.	4
13465	If you are tied to using only branded mobiles then you can go for this otherwise look for alternative in this price range. This is not worth enough for the money that you spend.	4
13466	Issues : battery and while talking screen turns on and that is iritating. Issue with proximity sensor. It heats while charging. Camera bump. It takes around 1hr 40 min to get full charge from 0%. Ringtone sound is good. Camera ok.	5
13467	Battery life is so good,Picture & sound is also...Value of mony	5
13468	quality not good . hang problem, they are not refunding the money as per they don t have refund policy for Electronic items	1

13492	Improve camera quality & battery backup	3
13493	"The phone renders power for more than a couple of days with average usage of games and internet. The look is quite good and the notch feels good while using it. It is a complete replica of IphoneX, lol. The processor is SD 626 but still pretty good for home usage, I played PUBG quite a times with medium graphics and it did not lag at all.I would say  pretty good mid-range phone for gaming, the graphics look pretty good.The UI is again very very smooth, I own a Redmi 6 too and UI is much better than that. Go for a pro version if you are aiming for Redmi 6.Coming to most important feature, Camera. Am really disappointed with camera's performance. No Portrait mode in selfie. Back camera takes ""good"" picture in broad daylight while front takes average. The grains are clearly visible when zoomed.If you are not looking for a great camera, this is the best phone one could get in this price range with other minor features."	4
13494	Battery defect	1
13495	Waste of money after one week it's performance to slow..no continue shots photography	3
13496	Awesome Product except finger print scanner which we use occasionally.Great Deal by Amazon India. I request Amazon to please make some good cover/case available for this phone with reasonable price.	5

13501	I have this phn(4/64 version). Overall performance is good. Camera is decent at this price point. But the speaker's quality is too bad. Even after full volume  the speaker's sound is too low which really disappoint me. Otherwise the device is really good.	4
13502	I bought it for my dad & he is lovin it. Not top of the class but  looks feels and performs reallu well..battery charge last for more than 2 days.	5

13518	Speaker stopped working...  What do you people expect us to do after buying a product in Amazon...Seems I am not alone in this matter.  There are quite a few people having this issue.  Do Amazon or Motorola have any alternatives here of replacing it or refunding the amount back....  Guys don't let the customer loose their trust in Amazon.. Why do we need to wait in customer service center after buying a new product	1
13519	Classy Product..Superb interface without any bloatwares. Looks stylish and elegant at the same time. I'm seriously not a MI or Asus fan, so the best durable product in the present market is MOTO G6. Purchase it, you would never regret.	5
13520	Bc bill me imei no. Kuch or mobile me kuch or...	1

13570	Only look is good.  Camera is worst.  We can get better camera phone for half of the price.  Amazon just provided a replacement have to check out the new one.	1
13571	Absolutely the worst mobile ever.Cheap quality material.Camera is very week.Display is dull.The only thing is 18:9 fullvision display which can be seen while watching videos and nothing else.Audio is the worst.Sold it at 8000 the very next day.No resale value eitherNever buy this product.Do not lure into the exchange offer I request.I hope I could give it 0 rating.	1
13572	For the price its any day worth it.. Vivo v9 feels cheap when you hold it on the other hand this phone has a premium feel of a phone costing 30-40k.Fingerprint unlock super fast.. Face unlock one of the best even good in low light.You want to stand out take the blue color	5
13573	Its a awesome phone....go for it without hesitation	5
13574	Fantastically awesome phoneLook is awesome, while using feels reach, money worth 👌👌👌👌	5

13600	Recieved it few weeks ago , used it and writting a purely true review based on observations !<><><><><><><><><><><><><>In the box:  • Handset with built in battery.  • Headphones (Not the in-ear type, just the ?  simple ones which won't be probably used ever).  • Power brick.  • USB to micro USB cable.  • Information leaflets.<><><><><><><><><><><><><>MAIN FEATURES IN SHORT :#1 BATTERY : its 3000 mah and its enough if u are not a hghly active user or play too much games , overall battery is enough for about one day#2 PERFORMANCE : yah , it has a 3GB RAM and it runs nicely , no system crashes still noticed , but here too , if u likes to play heavy graphics games , u can be disappointed by lags#3 CAMERA : it has a 13 MP rear camera  Shots are good ( fastly focuses )  Doesnt works nicely in zooms( cost justifies it )<><><><><><><><><><><><><>FEW DESCRIBED ✅ points- Biggest plus is the full vision full HD+ (2160 x 1080 pixels) display with a pixel density of 442 ppi. This kind of display is first in the price segment.- Made of 7000 grade aluminium making it tough and durable but note that it is only the frame & not the back.- Snapdragon 435 which is the current generation chip as compared to 430 being used in nokia 6 which is a generation old.- Dedicated dual sim slot and separate micro SD card slot.- Single hand use possible despite 5.5' screen thanks to the thin bezels- Latest android version 7.1.1 Nougat- Launch offer of one time free screen replacement within 6 months.<><><><><><><><><><><><><>Where it lacks:- No fingerprint scanner.- Speaker located at the back.- Many phones in this price segment come with Snapdragon 600 series SOC , so in gaming & heave duty performance it will lag in comparision to Chinese brands.Verdict : finally its a good phone that comes under a good range with some exciting exchange offers , but if u r hardcore gamer / uses mobile too much  , u should go for some better phones !([...] )KUNJ GOYALTHANKS	4

13606	Very compact phone in the price tag......	5
13607	Battery sound n display r awesome but front camera is not good as accepted..	4
13608	REGARDING THIS PHONE I WOULD SAY THAT THIS PHONE ISN'T SO POWERFUL BUT VERY ATTRACTIVE IN ITS DESIGN AND DISPLAY. IT HAS EXTREMELY SLIM SCREEN BORDERS. THE DISPLAY HAS ROUNDED CORNERS BUT DOESN'T HAVE 2.5D CURVED GLASS. --> IT HAS 2160x1080 RESOLUTION WHICH IS A NICE ASPECT RATIO.--> IT DOESN'T HAVE A NOTIFICATION LIGHT :(--> BUILT QUALITY IS GOOD IN THIS PHONE.--> IT ALSO HAS FACE RECOGNITION SECURITY OPTION.COMING TO ITS SPECIFICATIONS...--> IT IS NOT A POWERFUL SMARTPHONE WHICH COMES WITH SNAPDRAGON 435 CHIPSET.--> IT IS A 64-BIT  OCTA CORE 1.4 GHZ PROCESSOR.--> IT COMES WITH 32 GB STORAGE AND 3 GB RAM.IT COMES WITH LG DEFAULT THEME BUT YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE IT LIKE STOCK BY GOING IN SETTINGS WHICH IS A GREAT OPTION.COMING TO ITS PERFORMANCE AND GAMING...--> IT HANDLES BASIC TASKS VERY WELL.--> INTERFACE IS SMOOTH AND DOESN'T HEAT UP ON BASIC TASKS BUT I FOUND SOME HEATING ISSUES IN SOME HEAVY GAMES.--> IT HAS 3000 MAH BATTERYSOME DRAWBACKS..--> IT LACKS FINGERPRINT SENSOR.--> BATTERY LIFE IS NOT SO GOOD.--> NOT SO GOOD GAMING PERFORMANCE.Regards,Kanishk.LG Q6 (Black, 18:9 FullVision Display)	3
13609	I have purchased the mobile ,over all it's nice but batter draining is little bit fast as it is 3000 mah only. Camera wise it looks good. Over all i will give the rating as 3.5	4
13610	best phone in the market in the mid range, I loved it, should be considered when comparing with Chinese brands	5
13611	Battery life..	5
13612	Product is very nice	5
13613	i bought pro 6 mobile and it is good but i did not got one time screen replacement details some help me pls (ORDER PLACED :12 October 2018)	5
13614	For the price it's a very good phone.  Happy with the buy	5
13615	Budget beauty and really it's is the best phone under 10,000And one thing , i dislike about that it has no finger print sensor but face recognisation is also too good	5
13616	Pathetic quality of camera. LG promoted well but lack quality.Clicked average quality images in day light but indoors, it goes beyond poor; no clarity, distorted images.No better than a VGA camera.Total waste of money.	1
13617	After 1 week the power button stopped working. So the phone is useless now.I would not recommend this phone because of low hardware quality	1
13618	This is a beast in looks, performance,sound,security and everythingBattery life is good because screen is large but is excellent .I used it heavily like watched YouTube ,played pubg,and browsing and got a juice for 1 whole day crazy.If you got a budget of 15k,just go for it .you wont regret it.Ever	5
13619	Good product, light weight, camera quality is too good	4
13620	Picture quality is good, camera is okay, sound pretty good	4

13625	Only MI	5
13626	Naice	5
13627	Good, very good battery. I used it with both sim and toggled both for 4g and it lasted me 1 day and a half while making g tonnes of calls.Camera is ok. Little zoom and pictures become very grainy. However post processing done by the phone makes it look smoother. Decent pics . You won't complain.Good vibrant screen. Picture quality is good and colours look good. I believe it is fhd display and it shows.	5
13628	It looks handy in this price margin. Don't expect much. it's okay for daily usage like calling, WhatsApp and for light weight games.Beauty of this product is, it's looks so elegant when hold this product in your hands. Stylish.	5

13637	I Booked LG Q6 after waiting for Nokia 6 for a long time ,It is almost 2 weeks I am using the phone so far all good..Best part of the phone is its screen which looks very classy and premium for the prize.The Heating problem spoken by many seams normal to me didn't found it much problem .Battery get you day long easily with Normal use [call,browsing,occasional gaming ,music ]Charging really takes a lot time it took me more that 6 hours to charge my phone to 100 % from drained out.I found call quality is not that great ,I had issues with listening even at the quite surroundings LG needs to do something with call quality with their phones that is basic for any mobiles [actually all mobile manufacture should give good call quality]Camera quality is okay and is manageable .front facing camera produces little blur images .overall build looks good.My screen got broken got it fixed by LG service center for free	4
13638	The product was good.service was were bad I received damaged product.replacement not done yet..	4

13643	One of the best phone of recent time, the camera beast ☺️	5
13644	A wonderfully built smartphone. And the battery life so far been amazing. The best thing about Redmi 6 Pro is undoubtedly the battery. Could easily get more than 3 days with moderate usage. The display is good but the notch could have been better. Picture and Sound quality are pity good but what disappointed me the most was the software part. I knew it was not stock android device and its the first time I'm using a Mi customised OS or anything but stock android but I wasnt comfortable with the customisation and there are some bugs in the software which prevents location broadcast alerts to be turned off in settings. At best I could block the notifications. I dont mind Mi providing its own user interface but it would have been better had the android launcher was also been offered. Atleast glad theres not much issues. Those who are used to MiUI wouldnt have much of an issue in any case. But having said that the performance is smooth and the device built quality is amazing!	4
13645	Don't buy . It's pathetic.	1
13646	One star less for the battery .. its not actually a two day battery, One star less for the camera quality. Overall average phone for day to day users.	3
13647	Only it is ok in looks. Not satisfying phone. Regret of buying this product. LG Q6 poor performance	1

13666	Camera is too worst considering price of the phone. Front camera worst than other ordinary mobiles. Processor not that much fast than other 2 ghz speed mobiles of redmi. Notch is only for namesake and size sake. It's a big let down. Bought this phone considering notch option. But redmi disappointed here. Is redmi started thinking India as dump yard. Redmi Y2 is better option than this.	1

13731	awsome product. I am more than happy. great buy for me during festive season 10+10% discount from SBI & Amazon plus 1000 extra discount with exchange. SO overall great buy for me.about mobile its quite awsome with good built quality and good look. good battery life around 40 hours for with coc gaming and using interent contiuously in day hours. so gaming experience is good but there is little lagging while playing PUBG against all reviews on youtube because this little lagging destroys the whole gaming experice. also we can't except more for this price range, sound quality is great with earphone, good without earphone but not great, they have made it more noisy in effort to make it louder.however all good buy for me. thanks to amaon and thier amazing offers and pro customer behavious and service. However I don't know why they have closed reviewing on Redmi Y2 As I have bought that mobile also. which is also good mobile but lack HD screen.	4

13769	It's a nice handy and light to use.. It is fast and well furnished technology and reasonably fast access to apps. Camera is alright	4
13770	it is average phone in this range many phone is good.cons is :battery backup 5-6 hours in normal use as 30 mins call pick or 20-30 mins wtsapp 40-50 mins another apps.Or you can say 2:30 mins, you can watch youtube with 100% battery.you can't listen music or anything at charging time because of there is no 3.5 mm jack.Front camera is awesome, but as expected back camera quality is poor as compared Mi A1.Overall if you are thinking MiA1 was a good phone and it will also a good phone, in compare Mi A1 price or features it is not good dealMi A1 5star Mi A2 3.5 star	4
13771	Writing review from my Mind A2 only, I am very much pleased with this much quality within my budget. And even at the time when I really needed it.	5
13772	Excellent phone for the price segment.	4
13773	Picture quality is good when the lighting is good. Otherwise its grainy/noisy. Sound quality is too loud and might sometimes distort. Battery life is very horrible. Will only stand for upto 6-7 hour on average wifi usage. Will be even lower than 3 hour if you play game or watch something on YouTube over 4g. May be this is all because of original Android.	2
13774	The thing I like most is it's camera and sound and a bit disappointed about its battery life	4
13775	1) Phone is little bit heavy.....2) Price is liitle bit high3) Processor is old	5
13776	A View Without Bounds	5
13777	Top grade performance... Awesome camera... Durable....	5
13778	Phone is very good,metal body is required instead of plastic body and always  on display should be provided	5
13779	Phone's back cover and camera quality is poor.	3
13780	It's  sleek. Soo many good features which was never expected. 100% Nice mobile with this price. And afterall its LG 👍	5
13781	FM isn't workingVery slow phoneVoice during phone call is very slow	1
13782	I bought this product 20 days ago and I couldn't find  any defect in it yet.I read many people's reviews that its sound is low, but there is nothing like this.You can buy if you want to buy it.	5
13783	Good full vision display	5
13784	Low light Camara poor like China phone. Other features good on Nova /p20 lite	2
13785	The mobile is said to be water resistant upto some extent but it was a shock to me when slight water touched my phone in just less than 1 month of purchase and it has stopped working.. All the efforts behind selecting this phne has gone waste . Do buy the phone thinking its water resistant.	1
13786	Good phone with better optimised MIUI, good picture quality and great battery performanceLove Xiaomi Redmi 6 pro, i bought for around 9k	4
13787	Nice mobil with premium looks.	5
13788	Using Honor 8X since last 80 Hours and True observations are as follows -(1) A glossy dual-tone design that makes the glass back look and feel premium(2) impressive 91 percent screen-to-body ratio with a much smaller bottom chin(3) Awesome Camera quality both front and back camera in day and night light,The Honor 8X has a vertically stacked pair of rear cameras with individual bumps rather than a module encasing both. There is also a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. The Honor and “AI Camera” logos are aligned in landscape mode to emphasise that the Honor 8X was designed to show off its camera capabilities.(4) Look and feel wise its best it performs great for its price thanks to the new HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC.(5) No Heating problems at all used heavy games and concurrent loaded applications (as a part of load testing)As for gaming, this is one of several recent Honor smartphones to feature the GPU Turbo technology out of the box. GPU Turbo is a gaming-focused optimization that claims to offer a 60 percent improvement in performance and 30 percent better battery life when playing games.(6) A 3750mAh battery under the hood, which supports 5V/2A (10W) chargingCons - The UI could have looked sharper, and faster charging would have been useful.	5
13789	Good phone at this price tag....	4
13790	Super batteryGood cameraHD+  display	4
13791	Really amazing phone	5
13792	Wow i must say for the SCREEN. A well designed product.Except for 435 SNAPDRAGON i liked everything, but that doesnt effect on performance of the mobile too much Everything we use daily is smooth. Could have given snap 600 seriesGAMES i dont play so not right person to reviewMOVIES on this screen is awesome and even viewing photos for that matter.CAMERA yet to explore fully but in darker rooms quality of both cameras degrade.	4

13798	It's just 3 to 4 months I bought and phone does not start. Service centre says phone is water damaged. But with me phone never had a drop of water. May be they sold a old phone. Do not buy Moto phones.	1
13799	In this mobile no memory card slot	3

13803	It's a very nice product & complete value for money. It's screen is just 'wow' factor & form factor is best in class. I got this through exchange at 10k which was awesome deal. Though there is a trouble of getting good variety of covers for this but that doesn't make it let down.	4
13804	best product for 12990, i got it for diwali offer its really great	5
13805	Camera not so good but okay for this price range.	5
13806	Worst phone I have ever seen. I bought this phone one week back. I could see black screen and my phone got hung issue. I contacted the customer service and they said they send an phone expert. The expert contacted me in phone and they said they will replace the phone. But no response from anyone. My phone appears black screen often. Disappointed with my new Mi 2. My new phone expectation is broken. Now I din get a replacement phone also. Defective piece was send to me with no response .	1
13807	Now I have become a Fan of Mi.Great device.Ordered it for my brother.And He is loving it.	5

13823	Good quality phone as per the price	5
13824	price bhut jyada hai........	1
13825	True Android experienceDecent camera at this range	4
13826	Looks of the phone is awsm but the mistake Moto is making again and again is that in every cell phone there is some fault like i have 3 moto users now at home and all the 3phones came with some technical fault like my G5plus was dealing with the networks and end up with the change of mother board . Then E4plus came with a broken microphone . And now this G6 came with a broken Charging adaptor . Don't know what they do like they just assemble the phone and pack it , without testing it . Overall moto is best if they correct this issue.	4
13827	Gst bill	1
13828	Don't look negative reviews go for it best phone at this budget	5
13829	Worth for Money.	4
13830	Its was so awesome 💕 😍 🔥.camera quality was good	5
13831	Great build quality. Got it on exchange for 14.5k. So worth each penny for price paid. Camera could have been better but still wt else you need for this price.Build , Display are impressive. Performance , yet to test.	4
13832	Awsm product, loud sound long lasting 1 day battery with one of the best camera at this range	5
13833	Big display (around 6 inch). Battery life goes for more than a day even with internet on n a lot of browsing.charges pretty fast.finger print sensor is really good. Great phone with a modest price	5
13834	Battery backup very low.	1
13835	This product is awesome. The display is quite nice and attractive. Overall phone look is lovely, black color is gorgeous. Camera and picture quality is 8 on 10. Battery life is ok.	4
13836	Good, only packing was poor.Vibration is also at very lower side. I do not catch the vibtation when rings in pocket	4
13837	Writing this review after using the phone for 1.5 months.Like:1. No. 1 camera app, no other phone in this price segment would be able to give this.2. Look and feel is other best part.This Includes single hand usage.3. EMUI is very smooth and attractive.4. Battery Life quite good considering 3000 mAh battery5. I am a moderate user so multi tasking works well for me.not tested in extreme condition.6. All the sensors related specs works very well(finger print,auto brightness,compass,auto rotate,Face unlock etc.)7. Low light photography is decent.Dislike:1. Memory card slot not there.2. Portrait mode edge detection fails often. Can be easily understood that it's a software driven things.3. Takes 1:45 hrs+ to get full charged, sometimes it heats up slightly.4. Gorrila glass is not there.So front and back protection is must.5. Full view video(both side of notch) is not available.I have got this phone around 15K under freedom sale+ Credit card offer.So I believe it's a good buy for me.	5
13838	Expandable memory option should be there.	5
13839	This is an awesome phone i am really happy to buy this just one thing i disliked about the packing that it didn't contain a tpu case and company applied temporary tempered glass	5
13840	This is very nice cell phone and fine value for the money. Only cover is supplied but no ear phones! It would be very nice if ear phones are supplied with the equipment. Good battery life is an added advantage. It lasts for two to three days with normal usage.	5
13841	Head phone Jack missing, battery life	4
13842	Good form factor, compact and handy, good looks, good performance.	4
13843	Premium metal build, andriod one and epic camera is the highlight of this device, some great features are IR blaster type c fast charging notification led which takes around 80 mins. To charge from 5-100% ...camera bump is not too big. Till now no issue while using it from 5 days sound is also too good nd loud	5
13844	Nc	3
13845	Just received 8x, phone is good but I was shocked to see it doesn't have video call facility. How we can except a phone of 15k doesn't provide video call facility. Hope honor will provide some update. Otherwise phone is good.	4
13846	Camera Quality low	3
13847	Mi a2 looking cool	5
13848	Pictures are very clear and sound is good and battery life is good	5
13849	not bad	5
13850	Phone getting very hot when am putting for charging.	4
13851	Improve picture quality	1
13852	Nice phone with good features, suitable head phone should be supply with instrument. Picture quality is average.	3
13853	Picture quality at low light condition are very poor and sound is also very slow so dont buy this phone	3
13854	Worst product i haver seen. hanging problem and network gone every time and i requested dont buy at the time big billion day they sold all defect products.	1
13855	SUPER CAMERA BUT BATARY DRAIN FAST..ALL ARE GOOD ..OSM MOBILE THIS PRICE 14,999....ANDROID EXPERIENCE GOOD... MY FIRST MOBILE MIA1 ...SECOND THIS ONE A2	5
13856	Picture quality is way better than other. Means you can really get nice pictures in low light as well.I'm not heavy user but still battery is efficient enough for 1 day	4
13857	Best phone i ever bought. After exchange i got this for just 7000(including cash back). Display is excellent. Camera average.	5
13858	Samsung Galaxy j8 it works perfectly fine over Oreo 8.0.Multi window and Split window works great and gives you a richer multi tasking experience which you never get in any other company smartphones.Dual camera works great when the object is kept at some point of distance.Selfies you may not love much because it shows real face of yours 😝64GB ROM, 4GB GB RAM,  Octa Core Snapdragon processor 18:5:9  SAMOLED screen &  worldwide trusted Samsung service centre.What else you want below 20k,  just check for best suitable bank cashback offers and go for it.Luv you Samsung	4
13859	Comera not Good	1
13860	Nice battery backup, picture quality also good,sound is also better	4
13861	Best camera phone	4
13862	I thing, I got a duplicate item.	2
13863	Bahut ghatiya phone hai koi bhi purchase mat karo saala me le ke pasta Raha hoon ,,,,,,,,,,, poor,,,poor,,,,,,,,,poor,,,bed , , products	1
13864	Wonderful phone - Just Awesome - worth for every penny. Got it for best exchange price	5
13865	Bought MI A2 because of Stock Android and best Specs in Budget. Bought RED color variant and it has a premium look and feel. Otherwise would have gone for Nokia.	5
13866	The phone priced at 15k is value for money. Like every mobile it has cons and pros but cons are not such a deal breaker if buying this phone version of 15k price as higher versions have many such competitor which is better in that price section from this mobileProsBeautiful and stunning design, glass backExcellent network reception as both sim are volteVery good back and rear cameraExcellent battery life will give you easily 1.5 day back up and with screen time if regularly using almost 9 to 10 hrsBig screen and elegant display with metal bodyFace unlock and finger unlock is excellentConsNo stabilisation neither in front nor in rear camera but hope with future update eis could be enabledSound output via main speaker is loud but a notch or two low it could also be increased with update if company do so but with headphone it is very satisfiable as with headphone there is extra setting which can enhance the soundNo fast charging support neither the charger is fast oneNo 4k video recording which at 15k price is understandable	4
13867	Awesome phoneBattery life is niceBut bad picture qualityOverall phone is nice	5
13868	Battery low and back camera is useless	1
13869	There was a Scheme of Getting 360 GB Internet on Vodafone and Idea Network. Tell Me How Do I Get That Scheme ?	4

13873	CAMERA IS GOOD	5
13874	Nice mobile with excellent camera	5
13875	I am writing this review after 1 month of use.Camera: Front camera quality is awesome just like DSLR. But one things is missing which is group selfie options which is better in Google pixel 3. Back/Rear camera quality is just ok.Battery: Battery life is not bad at all but it will be better if company can give 4000 amp. I am giving full charge at 9 am and after average use of net, music, camera it is lasting 30% on next day till 8:30 AM.Processor/Speed/performance: Speed is good I love it..no lagging at all..I have updated Android pie which improves my battery life only you have to off battery optimise options from settings.Android stock version is awesome just pure & simple.I love it & recommend to everyone to go for it.Only one thing I don't like in it is the phone does not come with fast charger..it take 1-1:20 hrs to get full charged.	4
13876	Good Mobile... reviewing after using for a month.. worth buying	5
13877	This phone is good.but battery stay on only one day.	4

13995	The phone is an absolute beast with the best in class battery backup for any power user. But the truth is that you don't need to be a developer or a gamer to appreciate this battery. Any average user will eventually become one (power user) after using this phone. The battery alone demands a paragraph of appreciation.Everything else in a glance1. The display: An absolute delight. The 6.2 inch screen is perfect even if you view from a multitude of angles. The brightness can get really low and...READ MORE	5

14000	One of the worst product in amazon shipping	1
14001	I'll be honest and say it... I'm not a huge fan of mid range smart phones...and this particular phone us for my friends dad.Since it was upto me to select the phone somewhere around 15k...i started googling best smartphones below 15k..and guess what moto g6 didn't make it into any of those lists.But the problem was i wasn't satisfied with the list of best smartphones i found online...and hence after spending a while on Amazon I figured why not go for something generic and standard one  like moto...and I go with the latest g series.The phone arrived way ahead of the actual delivery date. Thanks to Amazon.Usually whenever i purchase any tech item online..i cant wait to tear open the package and rummage through the contents even i it's just a usb cable.. but  this time i just left the package alone expecting a mediocre phone thatll	5

14009	"IT'S BEEN MORE THAN 3 MONTHS NOW.AT THE PRICE OF RS RS20,000.FIRSTLY THE CONS OR THE NEGATIVESCAMERA- 2.5/5REAR CAMERA IS NOT AT ALL GOOD AS COMPARED TO WHAT OTHERS OFFER IN THE PRICE RANGE. MOST  OF THE TIMES THE CAMERA FAILS TO BLURR THE BACKGROUND IN THE PORTRAIT MODE WHICH IS ANNOYING.SO YOU WON'T GET PORTRAIT SHOTS MOST OF THE TIMES. THE FRONT FACING CAMERA IS GOOD SPECIALLY THE PORTRAIT SHOTS BUT PERFORMS AVERAGE IN LOW LIGHTING CONDITIONS. AND YES YOU DON'T GET A 3D-PORTRAIT LIGHTING HERE SO THERE IS A MISLEADING IN THE ADVERTISEMENT ON AMAZON. THERE IS NO SUCH EFFECT IN THE CAMERA APP WHICH THEY ARE OPENLY LYING.NOTCH- 3/5THERE IS A CATCH WITH THE NOTCH. THIS IS NOT THE BEST QUALITY NOTCH.THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISCONTINUITY IN THE NORMAL SCREEN AREA AND NOTCH AREA. THE NOTCH IS ONLY THERE TO SHOW TIME AND NETWORK. VIDEOS ARE UNABLE TO STRETCH TO THE NOTCH WHICH IS WHAT YOU WON'T LIKE. AND SIMILARLY, MOST OFF THE APP ARE UNABLE TO USE THE NOTCH AREA SO IT's NOT ACTUALLY A FULL-SCREEN DISPLAY.CHARGING TIME- 3/5TAKES ALMOST TWO HOURS TO CHARGE WITH THIS PRICE FAST CHARGING SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED.BLUETOOTH- 3/5YOU GET 4.2 WHICH IS REALLY BAD AND FAILS TO CONNECT QUICKLY MOST OF THE TIMES EVEN WITH ALREADY PAIRED DEVICES. WITH THIS PRICE BLUETOOTH 5.0 IS A MUST. YOU GET A DUAL BLUETOOTH THING BUT BOY THERE IS CATCH THERE TOO NO TWO SPEAKERS AT A TIME. DISAPPOINTING INDEED.==================THE POSITIVES -DISPLAY- 4/5  {IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 5/5 HAD THEY ADDED THE GORILLA GLASS PROTECTION TOO}YOU GET A FULL HD+ DISPLAY,  BRIGHT CLEAR AND CRISP DISPLAY.BATTERY-  5/5YOU MIGHT THINK THAT 3000MAH WON'T LAST LONG BUT THE BATTERY IS THE MOST IMPRESSIVE FEATURE OF THIS PHONE. BATTERY OPTIMIZATION IS EXCELLENT. EASILY LAST FOR A DAY WITH HEAVY USE. SO BATTERY BACKUP IS EXCELLENT. OPTIMIZATION IS AT PAR WITH THE iPhones. YOU DON'T NEED A BIGGER BATTERY TO SHOW HOW LONG IT LASTS. OPTIMIZATION  IS THE KEY.""ONE OF THE BEST FEATURES IS THE ULTRA POWER SAVING MODE WHICH IS REALLY GOOD"".FRONT FACING CAMERA- 4/5THE SELFIE CAMERA IS EXCELLENT IN DAYLIGHT CONDITIONS. LACKS AUTOFOCUS THOUGH.BUILD QUALITY- 4.5/5LOOKS PREMIUM, BEAUTIFULLY CRAFTED, FEELS GOOD IN HAND.=====================================OTHER FEATURES - KIRIN 659, DEFINITELY NOT THE BEST IN CLASS WITH AVERAGE PERFORMANCE, RAM MANAGEMENT IS GOOD. HEATING IS NOT AT ALL FELT VERY MINIMAL EVEN IN GAMES LIKE PUBGSO let's SUM IT ALL, WITH THAT HEAVY PRICE I WON'T RECOMMEND IT UNLESS YOU GET A HUGE DISCOUNT LIKE EXCHANGE AND OTHER THINGS. GO FOR HONOR PLAY AND PERSONAL FAVOURITE IS THE NEW POCOPHONE.OVERALL RATING 7.5/10"	3
14010	Picture quality very dark	2
14011	Amazing phone in this price rangeOverall value for good quality phone	4
14012	Battery backup is very good	5
14013	Sound quality is really bad... For this price good speakers are must.. I thought I would b deal braker against realme2pro but realme speakers r really amazing.. If I use earphone I can't even here properly at full volume.. For this reason I have already exchanged once but got the same result which is very disappointing.. Other than speakers I just loved d phone..Camera, build quality, look, everything.. Idon't want 4k recording n other things.. But a good speaker is a must.. .. Please do correct it by upgradation.. I don't want to return it just for speakers.. It's a request.. Please..	4
14014	Writing review after 2 days of use.As most of users has already posted device specifications so I am not gonna post that.#######################Pros:1. Superb build quality2. awesome display, color saturation3 . touch feels great due to gorilla glass protection4. small and lightweight as compared to other devices5. can be operated easily with one hand6. face recognition works fine7. no heating issue while charging as charger adapter is normalcons:1. No notification led, i really felt bad as i got used to my motog2 led notification2. device heats near volume buttons while playing games and watching videos for long time, although it doesn't make it difficult to hold3. both cameras suck, pictures look okay when clicked but when you zoom the images you can clearly see noise. even my moto g2 used to click much better pics.4. battery is 3000 mah which could have been atleast 3.5k or 4k mah, although it lasts for almost 10 hrs with normal usage5. charger is just okay, took 2 hours to charge from 11% to 100%6. low quality earphones	3

14020	Though picture quality is good the overall perfomance and speed is pathetic... The response time is too much. It takes a while to render the home screen. The phone hangs for 3-4  sec before it allows for next action.	3
14021	If people looy for battery life or fast charger don't take this	5

14052	proudect fail or amazon  respose bad	1
14053	Phone is awesome but its camera is not so good .	4
14054	Anyone who is starting that this phone is under calliber with faulty light and proximity sensor is saying it all wrong. It was bug which is fixed in September security patch and now it works all well.So far battery life goes you can easily get 5 hours of pubg at hd graphics on straight.Battery backup is best when compared to other phones with 3000mah(Hey Nokia).Camera is the best part and performance is outmatched.In the end I will say ignore those negative reviews and simply go for it. You will never regret.	5

14064	This is literally a little beast. It's damn design😎it's handy. Well for the processor is concerned  it's up to average plus. But surely it's manageable. I too am a game freak it works really cool. And guys who says it heats up is true but the reason is it's having metal body and it's quite obvio😁. If U go for it I am sure you will be one man standing but proud about it. Just go for it you gonna not regret about it.	5

14158	Firstly the phone feels great in your hand.The Huawei P20 Lite is a sign of good things to come from Huawei. The company ignored the Indian market for the past few years, but returned with a bang with its two camera-centric offerings. It’s a phone meant for taking good photos, but when it comes to performance,  it lags at some places like gaming..Pros-Bright display,  well tuned camera,  metallic body,  slim design,  premium lookCons-Battery needs improvementLower logo should be done away with to give more premium lookIt takes stunning photos in all lightning conditions.. Nd feels premium holding in your hand	5

14206	Hi,First of ol the screen is good.Camera is Just average.Interface n features provided by LG are good. Faced little heating on sides as wellMain problem is with the battery. In 1 hour call u will loose 25% arnd. Which is very high. I wont recommend it due to this.PS- U’ll miss your fingerprint sensor the most if u have used it in ur last fone like me. Face recognition is below average. Slow n less accurate.	2

14229	It become best in this price catagory if battery capacity 4000mAh	4
14230	"In one word ""awesome"". Worth buying. 👍🏻"	5
14231	Never thought LG could make good phones. The display is big without making the phone size big. The performance is good though I am not a heavy user to play high power consuming games. All in all a very satisfied user.	5
14232	Fake gorilla glass it breaks very quickly and worse phone	1
14233	Dont buy it ....it comes with outdated sd 625.	3
14234	Wow wonderful  product just amazing true value of money what a device for picture gaming sou d just best.	5
14235	Mobile generally hangs with no cause.	3
14236	Super screen and look very nice.....	5
14237	The speaker already stopped working while on the call for more than 15 minutes. Tap it and it works again. And its my 12th day or delivery.Called up Amazon as well and they told can't be fixed as we have a window of 10 days only post delivery.10k down the drain	1
14238	It was initially good, over the time it started to perform worst. The touch not responding well and also the apps taking huge time to open and responding too slow, though this phone was never dropped by me and used very carefully. Very disappointed.	1
14239	I didn't like its design ...	3
14240	Best phone ever in my life quality wise and camera	5
14241	Good natural colour tone camera satisfied both with pictures and vedio and selfe. Battery life could have been more.	4
14242	The phone is good but the battery performance is very poor and phone is hitting front and back side both are hitting	2
14243	Camera is ok not good	4
14244	Solid phone	5
14245	Bought this phone during the Great Indian Sale and received in 3 days. I have been using this phone as my daily driver for like two weeks now and I think I am ready to share my experience. First, the unboxing experience is great. The phone comes in a black box which I really like. The phone sits on top of the box and other accessories are below it. Inside we get a Wall Adapter, USB Cable, and earphones. All the accessories are white which is good but I think it would be better if they were black (not a big deal though).About the phone, It looks really good in the hand and feels premium because of the glass back and minimal bezels. It kind of looks exactly like the LG G6 which is more than twice its price. Here is what's good and bad about this phone:The Good:- That display is great. Colors are vivid and low bezels makes it look like a 30K+ phone. None of my friends knew about the Q6 and they thought of it as a G6.- Battery life is good (not great). It gives 4 hours of SOT with medium to heavy use and about 6 hours with low usage (WhatsApp, Twitter, Calling etc.). Also, you should know that I keep LTE, Location and Bluetooth enabled 24/7.- Speakers are loud and crisp but distort a little at full volume.- Main Camera quality, for the price, is good. You can definitely use this camera for your social media pictures.- Front camera quality is decent in low light but it shines at day time. It also has a Wide selfie mode which I really like.The Bad:- No fingerprint scanner.- The phone heats up a little because of its glass back when playing heavy games. But for normal usage it's fine.- There is no quick charge so the 3000mAh battery takes more than 2 hours to charge using the provided charger.A minor thing that I don't like is the LG user interface especially the launcher. But It's Android and we have Nova launcher. Also, props to LG for providing a free screen replacement.NOTE: This is just my initial review after using the phone for about two weeks.I'll be posting my full review on my website { imohitpahwa[.]com } after testing it for a month or so.PS You'll not regret your decision of buying this phone. (I'll upload some photos of phone soon.) If you have any questions then feel free to ask me on twitter @iMohitPahwa	4
14246	Best phone from LG in 2K17	5
14247	Picture quality awesome  no head phone jack no fm radio	4
14248	I like the phone in all the ways	4
14249	I got the product but when i will get cashback of Rs.549/-.	4
14250	Charging cable is very small. Fast turbo charging could have added more. Front camera is OK as purchased knowingly this is 5 megapixel. Cover provided is nice. Over all lovely and handy phone. This is initial observation based on 3-4 days experience. Thanks to ATS for nice behaviour and on time supply. Awaiting 6 months free screen replacement warranty from Amazon.	5
14251	Nice phone for the price	5
14252	Your products is so good	5
14253	Great phone at this price range. Arguably the best you can find at 11k. I wish it ran on stock Android though.	4
14254	Picture quility, Sound quality are good. Battery life is average	5
14255	I received the phone on July 18th. I had problems with the adapter the first few days. It was behaving erratically. But now it seems to have settled down and is working fine. If problems crop up again, I'll post.	4
14256	Awesome phone with notch. Cool design,good battery backup (2 days with normal use). Only negative point is  'front camera'. The front camera is even worse then redmi note 3.Day by day,you will notice battery backup is slightly decreasing (actually it is patent fault of xiomi device). But over all,value for money. Worth buying.	5
14257	Best in this price segment.	5
14258	Best phone for 15000 no doubt. Great build quality. Love it	5
14259	Battery is good however picture quality not up to the mark	4
14260	All in all everything is good in phone but i most have liked delivery system on time but there was a few delay of one day just because of me that I could not attempt the call of delivery boy but i had called him around 5pm he had told me that he would delivery the product by 7pm but he didn't but except it everything is good.	5
14261	Everything is perfect	5
14262	I don't like..	2
14263	Best phone ever best camera	5
14264	Amazing phone ever I met.	5
14265	Hi friends,Now I can give the review after using more than 20days.i tell you complete review. If I miss any thing please weight comments. I will tell you good and bad think.Good for buy coz1.1 look is very good and easy to used single handed.1. Screen of this Mobile very good. More than 20 days no single crach i found on screen.i give 10 out of 10.2. Tuch very good and smooth with gorilla Glass three.10 out of 10.3. Face detection is good 100% work in outdoor and day lightning condition but low light in special night it will tack time but work for this you to improve face detection in that light condition. This function if you use you forgetting fingerprint scanner. I give 8 out of 10.4. Battery is only 3000 but it charged fast i try on fast charger also by redmi fast charging but that time phone hitting more. I preferred you use phone charger only. Normal user use this phone 24 hours till battery remaining 10 to 15 percent if you are having uses and play game on this mobile it will be used  4 to 5 hours.5. Performance of this phone is very good you can play high end game as like Asphalt and GTA easily on normal graphics high graphics it will be litel lack but you can ply easy.8 out 106. Software of LG phone is very good and is easy to use like for screenshot you didn't have to place two button, you just go down and you see screenshot icon. you can manage your back home and recent between also and organised asper your uses I will give 10 out of 10 for LG software.7. Real camera daylight photo is very good good detailing catcher and front facing camera also good in daylight photo but in night and low light front facing photo is not too good but Daylight photo is great low light photos from the rear camera it's your little noise I give for both camera 10 out of 10 on day lighting and 7 out of 10 in low light listing.8. Colling voice is very good . 10 out of 10.9 lg service center provide you good services.10. Tow some and one membory card also used it is good for how have extra memory card.Negative Point for this phone.1. This phone starting to hit on volume key nearby area if using game video recording starting slide warming. For this issue I replace this phone for this issue but new phone also having same problem. I think it ok ok hiring issue like redmi and other phone it cool.2. Loudspeaker is not too good.3.It's hang only tow time but start withing 1 minute.4 . No fingerprint print scanner.and you have too tack a time for use to face detection.5. Back panel made by plastic after 20days i found some scratch on plastic.6. Internal memory 32GB it should be 64 GB for this price range Lotto phone having 64 GB internal memory. But all of this phone is more bulky and compare  with LG q6.Oral review this phone is good to buy.	4

14311	Hi,I have been using this phone for past 5 days. I like the look feel of the phone. It's a premium feel. When comes to performance the came don't satisfy me much. I get blurred shots and though company says it's 13 pixels it gave me a feeling of mere 5-8 pixel. And images break the moment u zoom it. It's worst if u try to zoom and take a photo. LG could have done a better job on the camera given the price range. Even the 5-10k range phones deliver better pics. Pls see this part. I shall upload some pics soon	4
14312	Good phn with many specifications at this pricing but camera lacks	4
14313	Excellent phone, i purchased this phone after checked almost 15 phone, but only this is only which have excellent camera quality, clear glass screen, sound, display quality, everything is awason, buy this phone without any doubt,I love you my honer 8x	5

14331	"Hello there,Well, the three most appealing features:1. Pure, stock Android ™ One2. Snapdragon 6603. Improved Camera.Let's start the description counterclockwise,A. Improved Camera: This one has 12MP+20MP combination on the back, the 20MP one is a special Sony IMX 376 sensor, for better low-light pictures. The apperture is f/1.8, which means it takes in more light, enhancing the clicks even more.Also, unlike the A1, this phone doesn't let down selfie enthusiasts either, packing a superb 20MP same Sony sensor, along with LED Soft light flash. The front on the software side also packs a portrait mode, through AI support.So to say: No matter back or front, it has a SUPERB camera.I'm telling it after using for 5 days in mixed lighting conditions.B. Snapdragon 660 AIE:This is one of the best mid-range offerings from Qualcomm, and is in many terms, at par with the flagship range of the 800s. This one is clocked at a maximum speed of 2.2GHz, which is considerably better than the Note 5 Pro's SD636, clocked in at 1.8GHz. The latter one packs a bigger battery by a 1000mAh though. However, the new SoC is promised to be a lot more power and thermally efficient than its predecessor. It also comes tagged along with Adreno 512 as its GPU, meaning smooth and lag free gaming, even the graphic intensive ones (I'm looking at you PUBG!) Add to this the Octa Kryo Cores, and you have multitasking and multimedia presentation, like never before, thanks to the equally powerful LPPDDR4x RAM that it comes along with, only a few handset makers in the world can provide this kind of specifications at this price. It also comes with an additional dedicated AI unit, making space for future updates of the software. Which takes us to out last part....C. Android ™ One : This logo you will find on the back of this device, meaning, this particular phone, when compared to other phones running similar or same software, will get updated faster, regular, and more consistently. The phone comes loaded with Android ™ Oreo 8.1 out of the box. Except some pre-installed Mi Apps, the Mi Account feature in Settings tab, the software is as stock as stock gets. Supporting Project Treble, it is going to be even more up-to-date than its A1 predecessor. The previous point, about the dedicated AI Engine, this is where it will come to play, as Google has already released 9.0 Pie, that comes loaded with tons of AI based features that only improve the usability if your phone has a dedicated place for it. The Android One program, also means a minimum of 2 Android upgrades, while the usual Xiaomi mid-rangers only promise and deliver a single Major OS update, primarily due to their heavy skin of MIUI.Expect the sweet sweet Pie update in your phone by year end. The stock in a Xiaomi phone feels like a genuine treat.The above points I have experienced, read and written here only after using and verifying them myself. I hope I was as elaborative in my review as you wanted.Now, no phone comes without a few flaws, here are some of which I think I should mention beforehand:1. Low Battery capacity - okay, maybe they weren't able to put the massive and very useful, 4000mAh battery of the Note series, but should have atleast gone for something around 3400-3700mAh, because even though it supports QuickCharge 4.0+ ( not with their charger ) the 3,010mAh battery kind of feels a bit less in 2018, with the bigger screen and more powerful chipset.2. No 3.5mm jack - I don't know why this was sacrificed. Also, Xiaomi doesn't manufacture one by its own ( A Type-C earphone)3. No QuickCharge Adapter out of the box - Moto provides it for their mid-ranger almost at the same price.4. Lack of expandable storage - You're forced to either make do with the 64GBs of internal, or wait and spend more to buy their ""coming soon"" 6/128GB variant."	4
14332	Fabulous phone in a cheap price using for 6 month good	4
14333	Loud sound but probably lacks quality Bass , on headphones, it's better. Camera quality is good based for a 17k phone. It has been 2 days & as of now, it's doing well.	4
14334	Display and sound system is awsum. Proccesor works brilliantly.	5
14335	Within rs13000 . This is the best mobile. No hybrid sim slot.. awesome..	5
14336	Earphone and receiver not working wed 06 Dec 18. Service center is saying replacement of mother board.	1
14337	There is no NFC, Gyroscope sensor and coming without preapplied protective film and case..Better to go for honor 9 lite or honor 7x.. Not worth of 20k. I followed smartprix to buy this phone. They mention above features available..If there is no fast charging what is use of type c cable..	2

14353	Like it.	5
14354	Camera awesome value for money	5
14355	Pros: Features like front camera flash, torch can be switched just be an aggressive jerk of the phone, screenshot just by sliding three fingers downCons: Very very poor battery life, no LED notification, front camera not in full screen mode (16:9 aspect ratio unavailable) poor Motorola customer support, the flash makes photos yellowish.Conclusion: This phone overpriced for these features. The battery drain so so fast. Keep it idle for night and you will lose 15 pc battery. Just yesterday (Nov 8, 2018), I watched a 13-minute video which consumed 12pc battery, downloading 45mb file cost me around 5 pc battery. If you are ready to shell out Rs 16,000 for a phone don't splurge on this phone. Not value for money.	1
14356	Very nice product.......	4
14357	Phone has no direct video call  you can call with third party apps... Its big issue for not to buy this phone N camera not good also	2

14359	I am using Honor 8x for last 3 days and here what I feel about this phone -Pros:The camera is good, daylight photos are awesome.Battery life is goodThe phone looks classy with a bright screen.Cons:Speaker volume is low	5
14360	If you're an average phone user this is good investment. These mid range phones have avarage quality, any phone in this range will show signs of problems after sometime.	4
14361	Very clear on its purpose. high end display with crisp camera quality both rear and front. can focus quicker than redmi series camera. color saturation is excellent. the processor performs up to the mark but not for even mid level gamers. size of the phone is very good and comfortable to hold in one hand. data cable is of decent quality, headphone is just basic. at least HUAWEI have provided it for basic purposes unlike Mi. overall a very good experience.	5
14362	very nice product this kind of price segment... I m happy to buy this product... Picture quality is good.... Distant battery... Sounds quality is good..	4
14363	Its a great phone. Picture quality is superb. Because its an Android One phone, software is really good, unlike the Miui software of Mi phones. It is definitely a must buy for people who want a dual camera which takes great portrait shots without spending too much money. Battery life could have been slightly better but overall a great phone at the price it is sold at.	5
14364	I brought this phone for playing games but when i play for 50 min it gets heated up , i also have an asus but it doesnt get heated up, but the display and camera are superb awesome phone	3

14378	Pros:CameraAndroid OneProcessorCons:Battery life	5
14379	As excepted from Nokia.. bring nice handset after long gap.I'm very much satisfied..	5
14380	Good Quality	5
14381	Premium Design, Battery was high long losting but when it's come game like Pubg it's drain fasly I think it's common on all device, Sound effect little avarage, Camera rear too good front not effective, overall oki with this budget, no hanging till good processor.	3
14382	Sound is lowNo dolby systemNo front flash	4
14383	Battery, sound and screen size are perfect. Camera quality is OK, very grainy images especially in night.Overall the features at this price, it's a must buy.	5
14384	Picture quality is not too good	3
14385	Cell phone temperature is very very high at the time of usage from left side on volume keys	1
14386	Nothing I like most and nothing I dislike it... Its all okk at every place.... I mean its average to use this phone	5
14387	It was great feeling and satisfaction to use this phone	5
14388	I am facing lot of problems with itBattery will die with in 3 hrsHeating issues if we keep charge for 15 minutes mobile will become to much heat which I can make iron for shirts also with out any cost, so please don't fall in trap of company name and buy this mobile. This is my experience	1
14389	Good mobile for everyone. Split screen and camera is the unique feature in this range, Nice display with good sound	5
14390	I owned a Moto G4 Plus which stopped working after 1.5 years, no hardware damage or screen damage just wouldn't latch on to the GSM network, such is the plight with Chinese origin phones, really disappointing on top of that very few and late software and security updates.Nokia 6.1 well It's not a perfect phone but a very decent phone, great and sturdy build quality along with vanilla android UI and feel the way Google intended it to be, no bloatware and unnecessary apps and guaranteed android P and Q updates on top of that. Nokia is a brand that I grew up with and now it seems Nokia is back and here to stay given the product line for 2018.Yes you can get cheaper phones and probably a tini tiny bit better specs but they would all be Chinese makes, wouldn't be nearly as close to the build quality as the Nokia or Carl Zeiss optics lol that's something you can't find in Chinese phones.My verdict, it's a well rounded phone and definitely worth your money, feels and looks so premium in your hand. Go for it or buy a Chinese Oppo or Xiaomi phone your call your money.	5
14391	Nice phone. Front camera is not that good..	4
14392	The phone is worth more than it costs.. The features that u would find in a 20k phone are almost all available! Truely satisfied!!!	5
14393	Awesome product in this price range.Screen to Body ratio is very good. screen is very sharp and very good viewing angles. Camera is not upto that mark but the video stability software of LG made video stability very well.Only disappointed for not having the Finger print sensor as the face unlock will not work in the low light area.	4
14394	Sound quality is  I did not expect from I i I i I Idid not expect amazon such a fast delivery within in 12 hours, honor 8x battery life is good it lasts for one full day screen quality is awesome and we cannot get this type screen quality and design in this range simply superb, but camera performance needs change and it is average .	5
14395	I bought the phone expecting to avail of the 64 GB storage. I had already bought 4 products from Mi through Amazon, and was confident of a good experience. I am extremely disapointed with the working of this phone. It is so slow that, I can only use it as a basic phone. The service center refuses to pickup any calls. The Mi help line goes into a loop.	1
14396	Picture quality is OK.. Battery life is very poor.. Once full charge will come  3 to 4HR that's it...	3
14397	All are best	5
14398	Good Chinese product but price is high. It is not value for money mobile. Mobile Battery life is not good	1
14399	Picture quality bast	5
14400	Camera and sound needs little bit improvement.	5
14401	Under 20000/- rs budget this is the best smart phone..Camera is brilliant and for gaming, it is best suited phone without any heating issues.Must buy Product.	5
14402	Nice mobile. It's so handy	5
14403	I got this beauty on a great deal during the Amazon great india sale .so I heartly want to thank lg india and Amazon india and coming to the product itself .its a perfectly built beautifully designed gorgeous screen size and best screen to body ratio phone.u wont get a fully allrounder phone like redmi note 4 in this  but what u get in this is that what u can't get abywhwre else.Secondly I want to clarify some confusions1. Although the battery is 3000mah but the back up is excellent.u can easily get a 1.5 days of juice with a single charge2.although the provided charger is 5v 1.2amp but it rakes hardly 2 hr to 2.15min for full charging (my last phone Xiaomi mi3 having same 3000mah battery and the charger was 5v 2amp but that was taling same 2hr 30min to full charge )So buy this beauty with eyes closed.best phone for moderate user like me .Warning to all gamers & heavy users .its not fot u	5
14404	I like A2 camera performance. So I give 5 star for camera.But when I receive the device which was hot though the device was turned off inside Gift box pack, not sure what was the reason..As noted few days later the proximity sensor has intermittent issues (some calls screen go off properly ,few calls didn't though I didn't have tempered glass, realised it's serious Hardware problem after hardware test failed reply).Online support team requested me to take to walk-in service centres which are very far away, also Sunday closed.Due to only proximity sensor issue,  I give 3star for product otherwise 5star.	4

14442	Chota packet bada dhamaka	5
14443	This product is full power packed feactures excellent security options but overall this product is over heating i found only this defect in this device otherwise this product is excellent	4
14444	Worst product. Battery backup is worst than anything else. GUI is worst. General red mi options like silent, screenshot options not there in the drop down. Operating system is worst. The only plus point in this product is camara. Don't buy. I am a fan of red mi products but this phone is not in that level.	1
14445	Very reasonable price and picture quality is good.Sound quality is very clear and also battery life is long lasting.Thin and Smart.	5

14455	I like everything about MOTO G6 good looking, very handy, excellent performance till date, tough body. Disappointed in full screen display like latest mobiles and very late android updates. Expecting best in upcoming G Series.	4
14456	I wished to exchange Lenovo zuk 2 plus, but there was no mention of that model in the drop down list	3
14457	I'm facing some heating problems except that everything is good.	4

14498	Liked the performance and battery life.Did not like1. Notch blocking many notification in top. Optimisation required.2. MIUI some times not connecting to Apps from Mobile Internet and shows can't reach network.	4
14499	With great battery backup and wonderful camera this is a real beast with low price	5
14500	Aggressive ram management &avg  audio output both are serious issue, else everything is fine, u can't expect everything in a 15k mid budget smartphone, accept it.	4
14501	Ultimate product In this price range. Only one drawback there is no earphone with this phone	5
14502	DADDY IS BACK...!Using Nokia since 2009. first 1650, second Nokia 5233, Nokia Lumia 630..... &  now Nokia 6.1plus. I was waiting since the day I heard about it. It is something beyond expectations. The touch of the phone, it's killer look, it's feather like weight, wonderful camera, n most loving Android One.... I'm getting crazy about all these. Close ur eyes and place order. I was using MI note 4 recently... Nokia is back with full SPIRIT.READ MORE	5
14503	I was using last 2 months... phone is OK but sound is average...	5
14504	The battery is just ok. The phone is superb.	5
14505	Picture and sound quality is good.Battery life is satisfied what i expected from it	4
14506	Its been a month using this device, good packaging from amazon deliverd earlier than expected date. Great phone for everyday use with a good camera, can handle multitasking smoothly, best feature of this phone is its iphone x like 3d face id it greatly improve by time, though a little heat while charging but that's the problem of every phone nowadays.Display is great however thumbs down for lg Ui, I am using nova launcher instead of lg ui. It does support jio volte services. Overall a good product from lg.	4
14507	Battery no life charginge	2
14508	I am totally unsatisfied with honar 8 x, because of karoke smule singing app is not well supported.... sound quality is good but lyrics which display in this app is missmatche with music of that perticular song...  Actual problem is to that when karoke app is run in other phones this problem is not come as barrier. ..... But with honor 8X mismatching of music and lyrics I had ever faced☹️	2
14509	Good product very fair price	4
14510	Not working	1
14511	Camera could be better	5
14512	The below review is based on my usage for a month.1. Call Quality - Good2. Brightness & Screen Clarity - Good3. Battery - Lasts for a day during average usage & 3/4 of a day if used heavily.Charges to full in 1-1.5 hrs.4. Heating - No problem until now5. Size - Should use two hands.6. Lag - Didnt face any until now.7. Performance - Good, indeed very good.8. Primary Camera - Very BadIs it really 20+12 mp?Doubtful...Photos are so bad.You will be disappointed for sure if you are an extensive Camera User. Low light its worst.9. Secondary/Selfie Camera- Between Good to Bad.10. Google Android One OS - Very Good & User Friendly.11. Volume is audible on speaker only after increasing past 50%.I waited for this phone for so long looking at the specifications and the price. But after a month's of usage I should say, I made a mistake. Wont buy an MI Phone anymore.Amazon Delivery - Excellent!	3
14513	Night vision pic	3
14514	Bought the phone a few months back.... Already facing trouble with bluetooth connectivity, battery issues , camera  is not as great anymore.... I had the Moto G5s + and felt this was an upgrade.... Quite disappointed. I got it for 7.8k in the exchange offer long back, so I guess can say for the price it was OK	3
14515	Camera quality is not good except camera everything thing is good	4
14516	Please don't buy this mobile. Getting hang also even after formatting the mobile camera quality is also not too good. Total waste of money. Thats why MI now sales it at discount	1
14517	Nice product, excellent performance and picture clarity. Timely delivered with out any damage.	5
14518	awesome 5.5 inch display phone with only 140 cms in length, slim sleek design, crisp clear sound in both earpiece and loud speaker again the earphones are also pretty nice in performance.for any normal use it feels buttery but for heavy games this wouldnt be the right choice . Battery and built quality is good and its feels good to holdand operate the charming phone .only got disappointed with the front camera which is a clicks picture of average quality and the back panel, which is completely plastic (prone to scratches) .. makers would have done it better with matte rubber finish .	4
14519	Apart from camera quality, the phone is superb in performance in all aspects along with some best in class features it has which is undoubtedly the best in this medium range mobiles.	5
14520	Best phone in this price,Battery is powerfulPicture quality is fineSound quality is clear	5
14521	Mi is not consistent with its display. Same display type but too much difference if you compare two same phone. Mi must do something for its screen consistency or start adding option to chose display(warm, cool) as variant.I don't like warm display, like cooler.True Colors are no longer true Colors at all.	3
14522	I liked it	5
14523	just ok	4
14524	Only draw back is there is no memory card slot. Other than that good.	4
14525	Nice phone for good	5
14526	LG Q6 is an awesome device in its price.Display is excellent with vivid colours. Its compact and light weight phone. Got it for my brother yesterday only.Camera is also pretty good with lg's superb Camera UI.Everything on this phone is excellent when compared with similar priced phones. Don't just see numbers, see the actual performance and quality.Display - 4.5Design - 5Rear camera - 4Front camera - 4Performance - 4Battery ( i will update latter)User interface is quite different from other brands but is fluid, fast and feature rich.I loved the build quality of the phone.Will surely update the review after 5-7 days.Thanks LG	4
14527	Ordered at the first sale, got the device next day. Used for a while, performance is worth the money. Could not ask for more in this range.READ MORE	5
14528	Phone gets warm on normal to heavy use such as while watching videos on Youtube or while having multiple tabs open in Chrome. Looks stunning.I expect LG to fix the minor warming issue in a software update if at all, it is possible. For normal users (which is 99% of the world) this phone is good. There is too much hype on powerful specs whereas what most people do is open camera and Instagram at the same time and term it as heavy use.Edit : Gets mildly warm even while using camera. The back got scratched within one day of use. Got the ice platinum one so the scratches are clearly visible.	4
14529	I am loving it	5
14530	Simply super	4
14531	I am writing this review after using this mobile for a month. Solid build quality. Good battery life. Performance is also awesome. Only problem with camera in low light. In day light camera quality is excellent. Thanks Nokia for come back again.	5
14532	good mobile phone and battery life	4
14533	Everything is excellent except front camera...	4
14534	Need so many updates and modification . Nice product with exchange	3
14535	As expected this phone have wonderful features with this priceCamera,sound, battery & display all this are above expectations.	4
14536	After a long time bought a LG MOBIKE.Got these for my mother. Only it was because of awesome display I bought these.If the back was metal it glass it would have made a killing. Still I recommend buying these Uti do not play heavy graphics gaming. Nice for seeing movies and front and rear camera also have nice pics.	5
14537	Phone is nice. Very user friendly.Screen size though 5.5 inches, but due to full vision 18:9 display, it actually is smaller than 5' regular smartphones.Battery life and performance is quite good.Plus, I got a good deal on the purchase. So worth buying.	4
14538	Using it from last 10 days and I found that lg's UI is best has many useful feature..love the face I'd feature it works vry fast . Hardware is also vry good and it's a best alternative of any premium flagship smartphone	5
14539	The phone performs really well and is a very good buy in this budget. Only problem is the battery life. Initially I was getting a good battery life but after a months use the battery life has reduced by almost 40% which I am experiencing from last 15 days.	4
14540	i am using it from 1 week its a good mobile under 15kdisplay of this mobile is awesome and design also very goodback camera is not good as compared to real me 2 pro front camera is goodbattery is also good.	5
14541	Great phone!!	5
14542	Really it's cheaf and  best phone in this range picture quality is awesome also battery backup is too long compare to 3100 mh I recommend to you if you are looking mi A2 believe be buy blindly....	5
14543	Update after 4 days of use - even while charging the phone in battery saver mode it gets hot.  while its a great concept - this needs some refining - may be a snapdragon 6XX and they can charge another 2K extra like the mi max 2.Update after 3 days of use.  This is a great phone in all aspects. However it gets very hot even for basic things like GPS usage or Bluetooth.  Might be a precursor for future issues.  Better stick to redmi note 4. I dont even play games and am facing heatness issues!I dont play games and this is the first day reviewPros:Screen which is its main USPNo discernable lagreasonably fastFace unlock has been 100% accurate thus far - though it does take a secondCons:When it was auto downloading apps from my earlier phone - was pretty hot - but now its back to normalOverall works like advertized.  Havent done any heavy duty work and hence cant vouch for the processor.  Shifted from my mi max and I kinda miss its screen :)I got this for 8K post nexus 5 exchange and 15% SBI offer...definitely worth it	1
14544	Battery draining too fast	1
14545	Device isSuperb . Handy, goodBut this is the first time I saw advvrtisment every where even in galary and in file manager too.	5
14546	Overall its good Go for this phone Honor has beated IPhone Series Phones so worth for the money I am owning Honor View 10 Got 2 phones for my Friends hope I ll buy more from this seller thanks for this item.	5
14547	Though we have other alternative models now in the range of 10000 but as I got it in 8999 in the sale, it's good	3
14548	Excellent product. Good clarity on voice and screen.	5
14549	After a long time such a stylish phone i get.Good cameraGood bettery lifeGood screenGood looksAll in one pack.	4
14550	Everything is awesome but battery life should be more..... Camera and look is superb!! Go for it.... It's brilliant phone	5
14551	It's price worthy. Nice picture quality. I'm loving it. More features same as Mi A2. Better battery performance.	5
14552	Great product worth money	5
14553	My usage of phone is about 10-12 hrs a day with Internet and its working whole day if charged full once in a day.Sound quality and camera quality is not good.AI provided in camera is not working well as in REAL ME 2.	3
14554	Other than camera quality, nothing is appreciable in this phone. The phone doesn't have it's own Gallery, Music or video player. Even the original theme is not good. Apps can't be grouped. Overall i don't find it user friendly.	1
14555	Guys plz dont buy these kind of cheap product on higher price.  It heats like burner.  Very slow.  I thought LG is a big brand and mobile will be good.  Amazon will only replace, no return.  Plz don't buy	1
14556	Overall experience is good.	5
14557	Pictures are not clear	4
14558	product was delivered in time and it was as per specification. its awesome in this particular range i brought during new year offer 12990. battery backup is also good one day using internet.	5
14559	Picture quality is good and sound quality is not that much good battery life one day you can use for netbrowsing and phone calls.in this product full display visible and curve edges is good. Number of times fallen down display and touchpad is very strong.	5
14560	Super Mobile	4
14561	NICE LOOK	4
14562	Good phone. &compact, camara is good, 4gis very fast	5
14563	Buy for:1) Amazing Camera: Suberb colour captures in daylight and amazing details at night. Google Ai light enhancement is also available post clicking the image in low light. EIS stabilization is now available in 4K and Slo-mo video as well.2) Updates: Monthly security patches, bug fixes and improvements directly by Google, before any other Mi phone.3) Stock Android: It's beautiful, fast and cluster free. Google seamlessly integrates a lot of features with Google assistant. Though not as feature rich as MiUi.5) Hardware: Snapdragon 660 coupled with 128 GB internal and 6GB RAM ensures ultra smooth and fast performance, irrespective of how many apps are simultaneously open in the background. You'll hardly notice them.6) Fast Charge: This phone support QC Fast Charge 4.0 but sadly Xiaomi provides a standard charger with the phone.Don't Buy for:1) Battery: It's small, it lasts maximum a day on low to medium usage. Wish they could squeeze in the battery from Redmi Note 5 Pro.2) Features: Stock andoird means it lacks a lot of basic functions, features and apps which one might take for granted in custom skins like MiUi. Like a barcode/document scanner, WiFi share via QR code, etc.3) Storage: No SD card slot means that 128GB internal is all that you will have. If that is an issue for some, it can be a deal breaker.4) No Audio Jack: It lacks a 3.5mm audio jack. They do provide a USB-C to 3.5mm converter, but it essentially means, you can't use you headphones while charging the phone (which you might need to due to its low battery capacity). Also, when using regular headphones/earphones through the convertor, the end quality of the sound is just not as good. Better to invest in Bluetooth or USB-C headphones for that matter.	4

14570	The red colour shown in product page in amazon website is not the original colour. its kinda more of pink colour than red. (check some mi a2/6x video in youtube) after setting up account & SIM activation, touchscreen latency becomes very much visible & after 3 hrs, no response for touch. Phone is active, power button works, but cant open any apps or anything.Just a display device with lock-screen/wallpaper. :(have requested for replacement on day one. waiting for technician.	1
14571	The worst phone for 20k. Period. Huawei claims to be the second biggest mobile company in the world. But I have recently switched to your mobile P20 lite. Despite paying a premium price of 20000 for the phone I did not get any fast charger with it. It takes 3 hours to completely charge the phone. How do you expect people to choose Huawei in the future if you cant even provide a proper charger with the phone. I recommend everyone to stop buying this until they start supplying quick charger with it.Follow up: So I purchased a Huawei 9v 2a fast charger from Honor store. To my surprise that charger takes even more time than the bundled one. Highly disappointed with the phone, I don't recommend anyone to buy this phone you will just get fed up of the battery and the slow charging time.	1

It will run one day on normal usage. But if you play games more than half an hour everyday then you will need to charge once in a day.Ambient light sensor is not that much accurate which results in improper working of adaptive brightness.	4

14651	Loved it only the thing battery life could have more better.	5
14652	My review is just not about the product alone but also about the pathetic service provided by Amazon.I have been using this phone for the past 5 days. I observe a lag when I browse through photos while using Google photos and also for some reason my YouTube videos are being set at low quality, by any means I am not able to change it. Camera quality does not seem to be good, too much of colour in the output and the pictures does not seem natural.Amazon service quality can be compared to bsnl or other semi govt entity. During the delivery processes itself, the delivery date was deferred 4 times and the customer care staff wasn't hesitant to provide delivery assurance on the same day for all calls I made regarding the concern.After 5 days of usage when I was not happy with the phone and wanted to return it for refund. I was explained of another painful process wherein I need to hard reset the 5 day old phone and go through the process of reinstalling all the apps and data back to the phone and then get it tested. If they find a fault with the phone, then it gets just replaced and not refunded. As a customer I again need to take a chance with the replaced phone. If the problems persists, then I am at their mercy to get a refund. Uffff, once you pay then you are indebted to listen to us, I believe this is Amazon policy.	1
14653	Ordered it yesterday and received it today . Happy with the product But couldn't help but notice the very evident heating issues with this phone .Everything else is fine and it looks premium as expected.Camera quality is decent not great (both rear and front)at this price pointREAD MORE	4
14654	Colour is good	5
14655	Phone's looks is very nice.  Its really like premium brands and have a great look.... But its not support fast charging.  The output rating of charger show 2 amp and 5 v.  But I think its only 2 volt and 0.5 amp output.  Thats why its takes too much time....  Plz tell me what I do. .....  I just bought it only for fast charging.  But its not support....  And you told that its support fast charging....	3
14656	I found in this device all my wishes like awesome look, fabulous sounds quality, amazing camera pictures quality of both front and rear and extreme battery backup for two days. Its best for me in this range of money. Thanks👍👍	4
14657	Camera, Android One, Split screen, Display quality, slim design and ability to remember selected sim card to call a contact (applicable for dual SIM users) impressed me a lot. Battery is also not bad for normal usage, as some reviewers were saying. It lasts for a day, also if you have Mi power bank, it supports quick charge. Non expandable storage and bulging rear lens are the only problem I am finding in the phone, little bit afraid to keep the phone on rough surfaces, rest on lens as it could make scratches to the lens. Would recommend this phone if you get it under 15k.	5
14658	Best phone ever made by Samsung in this price range. Thank you Samsung for this phone and amazon for fast and perfect deliver. And once more thank you amazon for the gerat exchange price for my old samsung galaxy j7 nxt.	5

14671	I did not find any issue with Mi A2 . Everything like a flagship grade device , camera is very impressive and you will feel like you are shoting with a flaship grade phone . Stock android experience will fully satisfie you . It's an android one device so it will gate updates first and unlimited Google photos storage also provided with this , so capture and save it on cloud with no storage limitation. Only battery backup will disappoint you a little . But don't worry it have quick charging 4.0 support which charges phone very quickly but charger in box is only support quick charge 3.0.Finnaly , it is a worth buying device . You will never feel that you spend more for less. And i think you should go for red colour varient , it looks amazing and difffer from other phones like redmi note 5 pro or redmi y2..	4
14672	really awesome phone....	5
14673	All is well but 1 headset is not requerd in this box.	5

14680	I have purchased Redmi 6 Pro in Amazon end of October 2018.I was on tour in Rajasthan state. On 19th November 2018 my phone started giving some problem in Net connectivity. On 20th November 2018 around 3.30PM I went to MI Authorized Service Center, Arihant Telecom, “Narayan Niwas” Near Hotel Hadi Rani, Inside Udaipole, Udaipur.A lady sitting in the reception checked the handset and said there is a problem in Software and she asked for the invoice copy. I said it was purchased from Amazon and you can verify in your computer. Immediately, she refused and demanded the soft copy. I said there is net problem in the handset and I cannot get immediately. Then she has shown me a number written on the wall and advised me to talk to them. In spite of my repeated requests also she has not attended my phone.I told her, madam it was purchased just 15 to 20 days back it is a brand new piece. It is having full warranty. Then also she just doesn’t care and said as per my company instructions without invoice copy I cannot attend.Immediately, after coming out from that service center, I have purchased a new mobile of Nokia Company.It is my blunder mistake in choosing MI product. I want to take legal steps in the matter.	1
14681	Best phone in the budget.	4
14682	Very awesome product	5
14683	Ye Review mai phone ko 15. Din Use karne k baad likh raha hoo. Are bhaiya ji ye phone bahoot hi zabarat hai(value for money) Aur sasuri eki surat bahoot hi pyar hai jaise kisi laundiya ki.Camera To bahout zalim hai(Good Clarity in low and day light) Agar aap esko lena chate hai le skte hai bina kisi tention ke.	5
14684	Worst picture quality such a worst phone I had never seen	1
14685	Great phone with large display	5
14686	Sound hearing quality for other side caller is very very bad.	3
14687	Product is great but this is my 8 th order on Amazon for different products and Amazon always gives a bit faulty products or totally different products	5
14688	Looks beautiful and works excellent	5
14689	Bed quality ..Pic quality bed sounds are very low & no update this phone	1
14690	But not comparable with mi a1	5
14691	Nice Phone...Feels premium in hand..Can called it as budget flagship....	4
14692	Too good.	5
14693	Still the battery life is lowAll other experience is good. Regarding to the price the phone is good	4
14694	Mi best smartphone	4
14695	I bought this device on the first sale.. But I am very unhappy with the BELOW AVERAGE SOUND QUALITY and AVERAGE CAMERA QUALITY(though it has 1.8 apparture)Batery life Is OK..	3
14696	Within a day of putting in to use. Appear good product. Android one makes usual MI apps like notes and cloud missing.	4
14697	Good to buy...	5
14698	Camera useless	1
14699	Everything is good but the dual 4G support is fake...it's just that both sim slots support 4G but u can only keep only one slot at 4G at a time so if u put 2 4G Sims in the device only one sim with which u will be using  internet data willworking and other one will have no Network. So it will work fine if u use a 4G + 3G sim..so don't get misguided. Whereas both Redmi 6 and 6A with mediatek processor support  real dual 4G means u can run 2 jio Sims simultaneously...in Redmi 6 pro the processor provided snapdragon 626 doesn't have a dual 4G support itself so it never ever possible to get it fixed through a OTA ..so jus a bad luck for pro users as it's not really a pro..the lower version have better support for 4G.	5
14700	MI needs to upgrade with notch display, better sound, picture quality and phone dimensions 👍	3
14701	sound quality is just okI can't say its a pro phoneWorst front camera quality	3

14723	IT IS GOOD PRODUCT	3
14724	Really worth it.  Awesome picture quality, Good voice and awesome battery life. Smooth to access and great features.	5
14725	Stupid battery life and proximity sensor issue	1
14726	The good things- The notch design looks good- Small screen size is actually good. It's easy to operate with one hand.- Supports 4k Video recording. But quality ain't that greatCons- HORRIBLE ads in the PHONE UI. The ads just appear everywhere. You'll be surprised by the number of ads that will be shown to you by default on this phone.- The FRONT camera is horrible. Photos look as if they are clicked using a VGA camera.- Rear camera setup is also not that good. Photos are just average with no clarity at all.- Not good for gaming. Loading takes quite a lot of time.- Battery life is pathetic. It drains very fast and there is no fast charging either.Charging to 100% takes like forever.- Quite heavy in weight.	2
14727	I bought this phone few months back and am not very much satisfied with this model. I am using MOTO g5 s plus which is better than moto g6. Main problem i find is the camera quality is not so great as expected.Battery backup is decent and comes for a day. Turbo charger helps to charge quickly and regular features of android phone works as expected. Overall it's a okay kind of phone and not so great experience. Remember there is no return option available and only replacement is there in case of any issue.	3
14728	Excellent look. Nice camera. Only found that sound quality is not up to the mark and processor is not good as snapdragon.	4
14729	So bad phone camera so poor camera cartoon typ pics and network problem issue don't buy this phone	2

14743	Display is very dim, after Android Pie update, all ringtones have become distorted.	1
14744	Phone is good but the earphone connector which i got with phone was not working properly initially and after two days it became fully disfunctional. What should i do now? Can amazon replace it or I have to buy it from the market?	5
14745	Worst battery even after a month...Now after 6 months have to charge twice a day to keep it on till morning...Battery needs to be improvised even has to be upto the name of Nokia brand	5
14746	The delivery was fast and safe.Now about the phone, as it was a gift for me I didn't extensively research about the phone but after getting I must say I was impressed. I was more inclined to Moto one power but I'm happy that I got this. It's handy it looks beautiful after installing a gadgetshieldz cover and it performs beautifuly. My only gripe is the battery life and outdoor screen brightness. The absence of a headphone port didn't bother me as much as i thought it would but all in all its a good phone. Let's hope it survives longer than my Lenovo z2 that broke in a year (and the Lenovo service rejected it).P. S android one is a much better stock experience than any other stock os, so thats a plus.	5
14747	Not satisfactory..touch not good..when go to second space screen flickers...	1
14748	Another superb phone Honor. Full view is excellent. Rest will review after one of usage.	5

14787	"Its my 2nd lg phone I was using L90 dual which was a nice phone in mid range. I was searching a phone with same screen size as in l 90 i.e. 4.7"" .Though q6s screen is 5.5 but due its compact size it is quite handy and sturdy too. Back is quite ordinary but most of us is using back cover so no issue for that. Earlier heating issue was there but after update it is solved at large. Battery back is quite good but more is require as day by day our dependency is increasing for a cellphone. 3gb ram is lag free I am using since last 10 months I have never faced any lag although I am not a hard core gamer. Display is quite good . So for normal use It is a decent phone....I am quite satisfied. and at last I also like to thank Amazon for its hassle free service."	4
14788	Superb deal	5
14789	Pros: The picture quality is just amazing. Sound quality is better.. Battery life is less but can be recharged within no time.Cons: No direct plug-in for earphones. It has OTG cable for that.	5

Camera is awesome and the looks are almost identical to iPhone it looks premium in hand and very light weight. In the era of 6-6.5"" screens this screen stands out of the majority and is very handy for single hand use. Buy if you get it around 15k as above this budget you will get many value for money phones."	5

14822	Very good but sum suggestion..... Please salv this problem.....	4
14823	Good phone but not very happy it camera quality.	4
14824	The Red color looks tacky. Guess I should have bought black instead. The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest. I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone. I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol).  Why even send it. Its very generous of Xiaomi India !! Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!! So is the battery! User interface is not confusing unlike other brands but I will miss Google Now Launcher which gives lesser mortals feel of stock android (Google stopped providing for newer Android OS). Camera is good.This is my 1st Xiaomi phone and I am somewhat happy (damn you red color) with it. And maybe I had higher expectations on the back panel.	3
14825	After using it for 2 MonthPros1.Camera:- With 12+20 Rear Camera the picture is pretty much good as compared to other phones,Selfie Camera of 20 Mp is Very  good.I just the Camera of the Phone.2.Design:- Design is sleek and Compact.3.Performance:- Performance of Phone is Very Good.Cons:-1.Battery Life :- Is Not as Not Other Brands are Giving But Good for 8 - 10 rough use.2.Ram Management:- Continuously use of Wi-Fi Some time phone lags.3.Display :- We are not getting notch display with other company are giving.	5

14850	Home  Screen UI is too small, Good look .	2
14851	I have used it for 3 days and I am not satisfied with the camera quality as well it's heating too much so I returned the product. Thanks amazon for express delivery as well excellent and friendly return policy.	2
14852	Phone is simply superb.So far I'vent noticed any issue.	5
14853	Good phone all over but its suits to reasonable amount of people if the specifications are upto your expectations then buy it else the phone is made from 7000 grade aluminium feels tough and size of phone is quite handy back scratches easily but you can put on a skin 😊😊	5
14854	Picture Quality is not up to mark. But not so bad.. Selfie camera is awesome.Sound Quality is mind blowing.Battery life is too good.. A one day charge phone. That means a charge phone can be easily used in 1 day. Awesome phone.	5
14855	excellent productsolid build qualitytrust worthygo for it...	4
14856	I like the phone, LG Q6, very much because of its compact design plus full HD-full vision display that can be operated by single hand very easily. It may lack some features like finger print sensor, LED lights, etc., the phone deserves a buy. Remember that nothing is perfect in this world. That is, there is no smartphone which doesn't have deficiencies while keeping the budget in mind....!!! What is more important is that the phone must have the required features & specs that we need & LG Q6 fulfill the requirements. Instead of purchasing cheap unbranded Chinese phones, we must purchase branded ones.If you go to reviews, you'll find the every phone has positive & negative reviews; you have to decide which reviews are more, & what you require the most in the phone.	4
14857	Just awesome.	5
14858	Camera quality is very poorSound quality is also not upto the markBattery life is greatRedmi note 5 pro is far better than this one	4

14864	Orally good with this lrice	4
14865	It heats up a lot while charging. Hangs if small games are played like clash of clans and 8 ball pool,camera is not at all good.. photos are blurred if we zoom the picture clicked, battery goes down very soon. From 90% to 14 % in an hour, only screen is the advantage  best screen and HD display... headphones provided has good effect but too big  it won't fit in 👂 easily	1

14883	Perfect phone in budget	5
14884	After going through all offers on different phones bought Q6 n Honor 6x out of this loved LG even though many complaining about the battery, camera and other like fingerprint sensor. Well to answer them firstly proud to see made in india tag. Then about finger print sensor don't feel necessity when you have face detection.Using other phone Lenovo K5 note with fingerprint sensor without face detection but found LG more confortable with size and overall premium looks. Haven't faced battery heating issue yet though back up seems to be fair which is similar on the big high priced phones. When i hold this device feels solid built quality and close to feeling of having i phone in hand. Though i never preferred expensive iphone where you have to pay for everything after paying hefty price for instrument which has actual manufacturing cost 1/10 th of offered price and still unable to share anyting directly to any other android phones. Only problem that im facing is accessories for this phone like scratch guard and covers hopefully will be available soon with options.Also found handsfree with product of old style which does not fit well in the ear ...should have been smaller in size with soft cone like samsung and other brands.Thanks to made in india LG and ofcourse Amazon for wonderful offer and phone .	5
14885	1.The phone is a bit thick and heavy in comparison to its competitors in the same budget segment.2.camera is ok.3.battery life is good.4.in this budget u could have better options than this eg-asus pro m1 which is better than this phone in terms of processor,battery and everythng else.	3

14887	what a LG Q6 mobile... I am really impressed with all its functions. Good branded phone with all great feature in very low cost. I am recommended others too	5

14904	I purchased this phone in August 2018. It was working perfectly fine but in November 2018 it stopped charging and I had to get it repaired from service Center.Pros:1. Battery life is good2. Screen size and quality is good.3. Signal strength is amazing4. You can play light gamesCons:1. It gets heated up quickly if you play heavy games like PUBG2. camera quality is not as expected. It only works well in daylight3. After Android Pie update I am experiencing some abnormal behaviour like images not displaying correctly.4. Though this is Android One phone but updates are received very late.5. Phone lags sometimes and heat up randomly. Need to restart it to fix this.6. Portrait mode is not effective as they claim in ads.Overall this phone seems to be over priced. It should be in the range of 10-12k.	3
14905	Product badhiya hai	4
14906	Best phones in this range	5
14907	Absolute beast in camera department , the 12+20 Sony sensor are just too good although the stock Mi camera needs some optimization , I prefer to use Google camera and the results are amazing! In terms of picture quality it's slightly better than the Poco F1	5
14908	Best Phone in this price range..... Excellent cameras with great battery back up...... Sound could be better but over all okay okay....	5

14913	Hello friends i am writing the review for this mobile which i bought on october.firstly i wld say i got the delivery as promised by amazon.Let me start with the looks and design.its a well built and good looking mobile at this range,its feels little bit heavy but its acceptable as its has a metal body and a 4000mah battery.now lets move to the display ,camera,performance and battery life.i am not a gamer on the mobile but i think it will handle the games well.the display is very very crispy and clear and the notch looks wow(i wanted to buy a notch wala mobile).the rear camera is upto the mark for this range and its has all the effects needed i.e bokeh effect,slow motion,time lapse,portrait mode.the front camera is also good even if its a 8 mp camera.the battery takes abt 2hrs to charge and last for one and a half day with semi normal use(only i dont play any game but wifi is on for whole day).i also see movies and listen to the song.well if u r looking for a smart fone till 13k with a good battery backup then u can go for it.thumbs up i.e 4.5 stars out of 5 for this fone.well if u frnds find my review helpful don't forget to give me a thumbs up.thank you.	4
14914	Overall good product.	4
14915	Awesome phone i really like it. Face id work really fast, also fingerprint sensors. Back cam is super, front cam is okey. Super gaming experience no lagging in high graphics. Amazing battery performance..	4

14922	Like - Looks and featuresDislike - Battery and size	5
14923	Good phone with good speed.but not good camera.Camera is low standard at this price.	3
14924	received product in good form.	5
14925	Got this device for 12500 after hdfc card offer and amazon pay offer. Pretty good device with good hardware.i would say its a highly underrated device. Selling numbers was less due to some omissions done by xiaomi. Otherwise this would have been the topper,if it had triple slots and headphone jack (same as a1).seen many reviews regarding sound.yes its correct upto an extent but its not that basic.sound is not good upto 75%volume but at 90%volume its pretty loud.and next main topic on reviews is battery backup.yes its low according to xiaomi standards.but for a medium or average user it lasts a day.for 1st day i got 5h abve screen on time with some basic needed apps.then i installed around 70apps and it was around 4h.for 3000mah its good.guys it support quickcharge 4 so buy a mi powerbank thats solved.charging time with basic apps was around 1hr 30mnts and after loading all apps it was around 1hr 50mnts with supplied normal charger.  And next thing people complain is proximity sensor issue,what i found is placement of sensor is weird so its better you place your phone according to that on ear. Ambient light sensor caliberation is not so good but not terrible.Pros1. Good display, clarity of display is awesome.eventhough i am used to samsungs amoled display then also i could not find any issues on this device2. Snapdragon 660! It is a real gem for this price.no lags or hiccups whatsoever till date with above 70apps installed.gaming is smooth and loading time is pretty less3. Call quality and signal reception is good.i am using 2 sims and no problem with it.4.android one! This may be a con for some people who loves tuned ui's.but to me using pure android is more preferred.5. Camera! Thats the selling point of this phone and it can produce really surprising images.i didnt expexted this much clarity and details from a xiaomi device.video recording details are good but there is a problem with focus.it try to focus frequently6. No heating problems while using utube or social media apps or medium gaming. Slightly got warm when i recorded a video. It cannot be called as heating7. Ir blaster is a good addition as phones around this price range skips that.8. Advantages of buying a phone without notch(except water drop notch) is you dont need to compromise on notifiction visibility and u will get certain additions like front flash.Cons1. Could have gone with a 3500mah battery.and you have not provided a fastcharger in box! Why? Selling a device for 17k and no fast charger in box.2. Currently prices for xiaomi mobiles are little high.for example redmi note 5 pro is a phone for only 13k and mi a2 15k.3. omission of headphone jack. What xiaomi! What research and development you do before releasing a product. In mi a1 jeadphone jack was the most loved feature.4. No sd card slot. If internal was 128gb then your(xiaomi) choice is right! But for a 64gb device you should have gone with triple slots. Please dont imitate apple with internals too!5. Eventhough its a android one device os updates on mi devices are slow. Nokia android one devices has started recieving pie update.6. Focus hunting issue while recording videoGuys eventhough it has some flaws this is the best choice if you get this for 15k or less.because it comes with a good midrange chipset and internals.nothing so bad as like on many reviews.display is adequatily bright,could have been a little more brighter when outdoors but its legible not bad. If you get good discount go for it without any second thought. i purchased red device and with light reflections it has a rose shade but at some angles its pure red😂😂.whatever i liked this device and highly reccomend this one!	5
14926	Good!!!!	5

My past one is honor now again i am with same brand reason is i never felt my phone hanging.First thing it is very compact and can use it in a single handAwesome cool DisplaySuperb soundCamera is excellent againIn the begining i felt battery draining very fast but after an update battery back up is really good. Continuous usage of internet we can get battery backup more than 12 hours .Quick charging available after an update.Compare to F7 and V9 huawei p20 lite smaller and compact display.Dont confuse guys go with it.	5

14967	Best phone on this price	5
14968	After using it for 4-5 month's ,it's a decent one  I can suggest. Happy with it. Good battery life which is most Important. It works full one day with regular FB,Watsapp,Amazon eta and  even my daughter watches YouTube for 1 hrs .Speaker volume is good for car in case you need.camera an all are good.overall happy with the phone	4
14969	Osm battery are low	5
14970	Like,best processor and stock Android.but Price drop very sad😅	3
14971	nice and good productsREAD MORE	5
14972	Pros: Camera is good in both condition indoor and outdoor you can buy this if you love stock android with good camera only. And you need better security and performance and you don't like MI user interface,Look of this mobile is also Very niceCons:-1. Battery Performance :- Very irritating, from the initial time battery getting drain consecutively 😠 in plain new mobile ,double speed after installation of my previous application , fast charger is not provided with this mobile.2. Sound :- in Speaker sound is okay, but if you are in public place you can get irritated to listen caller voice over phone, you have to switch speaker to listen voice of caller during call conversation.In earphone you can listen music easily if you are at in your room, you can't hear properly sound if you are somewhere else from your home even though this device volume in 100%3. You can either charge this mobile or you can connect your earphone in one-time with extra provided connector for earphone, there is no jack for earphone or headphone, you have to buy a Bluetooth device to listen music.Over all MI A1 was better than this MI A2	3
14973	Nice sound quality	5
14974	Picture quality is very low. Colours are seen very dull. They aren't actual. Battery life is very low. Hardly it can spend a day. Not satisfied with this phone	1
14975	Good choice little costly	4
14976	Using this phone since 1 month and the phone delivers what it promises and the best thing is it's display and the in hand feel is excellent and it's touch sensitivity is better than any other Chinese brands and the processor is suitable for normal everyday use not good for people who likes to play heavy games otherwise it's good for normal users and battery life is also good it lasts a day with moderate to heavy usage ad charging speed is also good enough. Many people have complained about heating but it's not too much and manageable.Coming to the drawbacks it's the camera which are below average especially the front camera it's too much noise in photograph and the pictures taken indoors and under low light are not usable and the other thing which I don't like is the back design it looks like 5k thousand phone from behind due to its glossy plastic panel which is prone to scratches and fingerprint so back cover is necessary.So if you are looking for a phone with main priority on display, touch sensitivity with smooth operating experience this is a good option. Heavy gamers and camera lovers this phone is not suitable for you	4
14977	Build quality is ultimate. Screen is big advantage. Camera is nice.	5
14978	Nice Camera, premium look, light weight, handy, good performance. People comparing with phones like Redmi 4 will be disappointed in battery part only. Battery backup is good sufficient for a day for good use.Finger print is a miss but face unlock is working fine.	5
14979	It's big screen looks gud n slim but not handy ,sometimes it shows lag ...	4
14980	This is indeed one of the best budget smartphones .However the cameras are not that great.Screen is bright and crisp.Battery life is surprisingly good.EMUI is a little buggy.	4
14981	Third class phone	1
14982	camera is ok not the best.. front camera is below average also rear camera quality in low light is not good..front flash hota to better hota.. baaki sab thik hai	4

14987	Phone was nice in this price but so hitting problems .	1
14988	Mobile gets heated even using shatsapp and youtube. Forget about gaming. Front camera seems to be like VGA camera. Front camera is even worst than MI 7000 rs phone	2

14990	Excellent phone, excellent camera, no hanging problem	5

14992	Great mobile This mobile awesome. Camera quality is very good and battery power is best. Look of mobile is nice .	5
14993	The front camera is worst ever I have seen in any redmi mobiles.Wanting to return the product..Any one help me whether anyone have same issue with front camera or did I got the defective product..?	1
14994	Pros:1.Excellent Display.2.Premium Built.3.No Lags, good performance.4.Dedicated Micro SD card slot.5.Front camera suits selfie lovers.Cons:1.Average Battery(Max 20 hrs for an average user and Max 8 hrs for an extensive user).2.Phone restarts if you replace sim card(Too old and obsolete).New phones don't require a restart at all these days.3.No dual 4G standby.Example: If you are using 1 Jio Sim and 1 Airtel 4G sim, then you cant use 4G on both networks at the same time.You will have to switch off Jio to use Airtel 4G.	3
14995	Excellent Product .	5
14996	Good stylish mobile	4
14997	Very buy. Some issues are there like proximity sensor not up to mark. But very at this price	5

15008	Satisfied with features according to range of phone.Like the performance of phone. Phone look is very nice and very handy.	4
15009	No other fon has got better display in this price segment... I got it for 15k after exchanging it for an old samsung galaxy s duos during a sale. Camera is good... Performs best in outdoor conditions. Battery life is also good. In hand feel is great... Sleek and stylish. I chose the blue colour variant... And its absolutely gorgeous.	5
15010	Only negative is its poor battery life. Otherwise this is a quality phone.	5

15017	REDMI 6 Pro, is one of the best phones with all the essential features. I feel it is actually under priced as per the specs and features. Battery life is good.  Overall its the best phone in this segment.	5
15018	You best mobile	4
15019	Have received the phone within 18hrs of ordering, kudos to Amazon for an excellent delivery.The phone is however lacklustre, could have improved a bit such as the phone takes space and has only on-screen navigation.When talking to someone the phone automatically goes to screen saver mode and doesn't display the options untill after you disconnect the call.The battery and the performance of the phone very good with the high speed processor. Camera quality is same as the old Nokia 6 despite adding the Zeiss lens(no added advantage). The option of 4k video recording is an improvement. The fingerprint sensor works decently fast as well.	3
15020	My phone's touch id not properly working.. Some part of phone and key pad is not working.. Firdt time, I am facing this . I am a regular cudtomer of amaxon.	1
15021	Pros:1. Sturdy (experienced many times!)2. Nicely water resistant (experienced many times!)3. Timely updates (Most of the time)Cons:1. Starts hanging after a month of use (I am not a gamer. I have absolutely no games on this phone. Yet it sometimes hangs badly.)2. Battery capacity is receding slowly. (Although it is not significant right now, it has been just 2 months of moderate use. With half brightness and low to moderate usage, the battery drops by 60-70% in 5-6 hours. And it has just been 2 months. And it is Nokia !)	3
15022	If you planning to buy it for playing PUBG like me than don't go for it. Its horrible for playing PUBG in it.. It can't even give stable game more than 30 FPS. First of all it can't give 'HD' play in the game settings. Secondly you will have to be settled with 'smooth and balanced'. I setup the graphics at 'Smooth-medium' but the game lagged a lot. If you are buying it for other than playing PUBG than go for it or else for PUBG its a total waste of money. Better go for handsets with Helio P60...READ MORE	1

15044	Very nice picture quality and affordable price...just go for it.	5
15045	first & foremost i  like stunning IPS disply, more over mobile is very handy with 18:9 ratio, camera is fine and not so good or bad, i wouldn't see that much of Battery drain, reading reviews  i'm worry about battery but in real time my experience, a moderate user can manage up to 15-18hours, in final i will suggest it is not a great option to heavy gamers and high multitasking users and getting it for 14k is not worthy instead go for exchange option get around 8k-9k is fine.	4
15046	Missing audio jack, software problem, picture quality is good	4
15047	Except for the loudspeaker sound others are a big plus for tge mobile like battery, display, mobile design,etc	5

15053	Need to improve pictures quality	5
15054	Battery is fabulous but camera is poor. Really poor	5
15055	A nice phone as per battery and display is. Concerned.Main drawback is that, in this phone we can use only one sim as 4G and another one will be 3G. So if you want to use internet, you cannot use it in the sim inserted in 3G slot. It will enable you to use internet in the 4G slim ONLY. Hence if you have internet in the sim inserted in 3G slot,then you have then you have to opt it as a 4G sim then only you can use the internet.The problem arises when you have one jio sim and another Airtel sim say for example, and if you want to use the internet in Airtel SIM then either you have to switch off the jio Sim and and make the Airtel sim as 4G in the settings provided or else  you have to use jio sim only for internet which is the major drawback i feel	4
15056	OVERALL Rating is 4 out of 5 but considering the price point with the display and rear camera LG offers. I would say this is a unique among the other brand at this price. 5 OUT OF 5.	5

15084	It's very delicate. If you don't use a back cover, your device might get coated with water vapour of your residing in a region where it is cold climate. Which can even harm your device and further damage the mother board. Therefore, I recommend you to buy a case, a hard case back cover is suitable.	5

15145	I am writing this review after a month of usage.DesignTo me the design felt absolutely fabulous. I have heard people saying that’s it’s a typical Xiaomi design but believe me, it’s the most refined Xiaomi design for the mid segment till date. The rounded back, the all metal unibody design mixed with this slimness of the device is just too good. Oh yes, its thinness. Let me tell you that this is the thinnest device that you can get in this range. It’s very very thin for the competition. Even with the case on its fells slim enough. The only flaw in its design is its monstrous camera bump. It’s just too much. It’s as thick as much as the phone is thin. Even with the case on it protrudes out quite a bit.PerformanceI have heard many saying that Xiaomi haven’t used the Snapdragon 660 to its fullest. This indeed was true. But this is also true that Xiaomi will definitely use the processor to its max. Just wait for the updates. I just received a 1.2 GB (approx.) update that changed things drastically. The ram management is also done very nicely in this device. I started playing Asphalt 9 for 10 mins, then jumped to YouTube, watched some video for maybe half an hour and then again came back to Asphalt 9 and it started from where I left it. The performance section also have a flaw i.e. its heats up a bit. While charging the phone it’s still acceptable but it also gets little warm while using the phone extensively for a long period of time. I think Xiaomi should be able to address this with a software update.Recently I received the September security patch and with that the heating issue is address quite a bit. For most of the time its ok, but when u push the phone to its limits; use the camera for an extended period of time it’s still gets warm.CameraThe camera in this phone is this just awesome. It’s really great. The photos in natural lighting are just too good. In artificial lighting also it does a great job. In the 25k mark it is the best camera smartphone you can get. It just has no competition in the camera segment till date. The video is also pretty good I’ll say. The stabilisation (EIS) works fine. I also noticed that after that update that I talked about before it got an option to record 1080p 60fps videos. It seems like a feature no one offers below the 30k mark. But still not so great, the video quality in 1080p 60fps is quite granny and not up to the mark yet. I hope Xiaomi fixes that with some software updates. Otherwise the camera is the best of best. I have attached some samples, just have a look at them.DisplayThe FHD panel in this phone is good I’ll say. It’s very similar to the Redmi Note 5 Pro. It produces decent colours (whereas I expected a little better from it). Now u might have heard Youtubers commenting in their full review that this display is not legible in direct sunlight, the brightness is very low. This is totally a myth. I have used this phone in direct sunlight in the afternoons and it worked totally fine. It was absolutely legible. You will not have any issues what so ever (The brightness is good for all day to day activities but I wish I would have been a little better). The viewing angles are also good enough.BatteryU may have also heard that the battery of this device is not at all good. This is not at all true. In moderate usage it will get a throughout a day, giving a 5 hours of screen of time on average. If used heavily (i.e. I did extensive gaming and watched video extensively) it will give you 4 hours 15 minutes to 4 hours 45 mins (4 hours 30 minutes in average) SOT. For the capacity of the battery this is good enough I suppose. This paired with fast charging is a good deal according to me (whereas as it is a Xiaomi phone I wished it had a bigger battery resulting in better battery life).  I have attached a few battery stats, just have a lookSoundThe sound output from the speakers are great. They are adequately loud enough having some depth to the sound. I mostly kept the volume levels at 80 or 85. The earpiece does a good job also.SoftwareThe weakest point of this device till now is it software I’ll say. I know its Android One device but believe me the software in this device isn’t at all optimised properly. For most tasks it works fine but when it’s pushed, it shows its true colour. Sometimes there are some lags, apps opening delays, sometimes even some app doesn’t respond and stop unexpectedly. These all are totally software based I think. Xiaomi really needs to work hard in optimising the software for the device. I just hope all these are fixed in the Android P update. If Xiaomi makes the software of this device right then it will truly be a beast and even a flagship killer I think.VerdictThis is a pretty good device with some trade-offs such as the removal of the headphone jack and microSD card slot. The device surely need some work over the air. If Xiaomi does overcome all the software problem in this device and makes the software flawless, it would be a great device I think. Then people will try to overcome the trade-offs I suppose.*One silly cost cutting Xiaomi did that they put a single coloured notification light in this device. This is not at all acceptable from a phone in this price. It would have been really nice if Xiaomi had put a multi coloured one.The are some rating on each sectionDesign – 10/10Performance ­­– 8.5/10Camera – 9.5/10Display – 9/10Battery – 8/10Software – 7/10Overall – 8/10If u want to know anything else feel free to ask!	4

15212	Great camera, good battery backup, good sound guality and no lag on using multiple applications. This phone is a steal at this price point. I bought it in the first flash sale and have. Even using it non stop since then. Absolutely no complaints. So impressed.	5
15213	Battery back is really awesome.....and as usuall as all mi phones	4
15214	Mi A2 is just an awesome phone and I'm so glad that it's available exclusively available at Amazon.. The stock android is what gives it an edge over other phone at this price segment.. The camera is the best I've ever used.. Especially the manual mode where you can do a lot.. The only con is the battery which drains a little fast but can be compensated with quick charge..	4
15215	With exchange got it for 5,500rs . Worth it.	5
15216	My Mobile back camera not properly work	1
15217	every thing about mobile is running nice and....battery draining very fast at usage of internet	5

15221	Everything is good and Nicene	3
15222	Everything is just superb the display, camera, looks, battery.I think the sound quality should have been improved.Everything else is just awesome	5
15223	1 star for Amazon Fast delivery and rest 2 for Mobile1. Camera is such a pity.... Even My sis Mi 4a has a better camera.2. Heating is another issue LG common its Android oreo has came out and you guys still making microwave oven.... In just moderate use..... What will happen when we will play Games for an hour approx.3. Back Plastic the worst ever seen in my entire life..... By using Few minutes you will see scratch on back... LG its 15k no fingerprint..... Worst Camera..... And Worat Material.Only Display is the worth Watching Amazing Display 18:9 aspect ratio..... True Brilliance.	3
15224	Overall superb phone and notch display is gorgeous ☺😅	5
15225	First I trusted and purchased Huawei p20lite, am very upset after receiving it. I have not seen a very bad mobile in this price range. Perhaps, I would have gone for Samsung on8.	1
15226	Everything is awesome except battery, minimu. 4000 MAh would have been apt for this kind of phone.	4
15227	Good EnoughREAD MORE	5
15228	Great phone under 20k	5
15229	Awsome phone. Display is best in class, battery backup is great. Phone is smooth on regular use, does not get even warm. Call quality is very good. Overall size of phone is same as many 5 inch scren phones available in the market.Only problem is that memory card cannot be formatted as internal storage unless phone is rooted.This is my experience after using the phone for 3 days.	5
15230	Nice phone by samsung....very fast delivery by Amazon.....very happy...!!!!	5
15231	Best ever camera i have seen in this budget. Having perfect details, colour saturation, hdr, etc. Very nice low light camera.	5
15232	Loved it .	5
15233	good phone under good price	5
15234	Best product one can get under 20k range. You will get 2 Ai enabled rear cam(20MP + 12MP) and its edge detection in portrait mode is also superb. You will get a 20MP front cam with flash and portrait mode. Its the best Camera phone in 20k range.Cons:1. The phone don't have the Optical Image stabilizer, though it has the Electronic Image Stabilizer as compared to One+6. But can't compare becauz there is great difference of the price.2. Battery life is not good. Like if you are kind of person who wants to take the phone to 2 days without charging. This is not the phone you are looking. Jokes apart!! Phone runs for 1 day without charging with normal usage.No more cons I have encountered till now, and its been almost 2 weeks of purchase!I recommend this product.	5
15235	I bought the lg q6 on 21 Sept and I am not at all satisfied. I bought it for 12999 at that time. The performance is pathetic. It does not have a finger print sensor too, but has a face recognition mode which works awfully. It takes more that 4 sec to unlock which is the worst in class. It lags a lot too. The camera is not very good. Instead u can get a dual camera in this budget. I m even not satisfied with the screen quality and battery life. Allover, not worth buying and waste of money. I would suggest u not to waste money on this thing, Instead u can look for a moto g5s+, Nokia 6 or anything else.	2
15236	Thanks to flipkart for delivering the one power mobile within 4days. Excellent service.READ MORE	5

15242	Nice and best product.	5
15243	Battery life is too too poor. second big problem is it's different charging cable. need to carry charger every time does not fit into standard charging cables. no direct port for head phones. need separate attachment.more over its ring tone automatically goes off and not able to restoretotally unhappy with above 4 defects.MI should take back with full refund	1
15244	Not satisfied too much heating.... Camara avrage at this price... Display qulity is to good... But overall not up to the mark	3
15245	Nothing much but ROI is ok in this price range	5
15246	very good phone	4
15247	It was well packed i order via amazon prime so on time delivery its going to be 3 months and the phone is running absolutely amazing.The phone phone has an amazing build quality, amazing display best in class ( next to high ended phones like s8 or apple x , just a bit extra sharpness but i would neglect that part) and with this aspect ratio it gives a rice look to it. Although lacks finger print scanner, for 12k it is the best buy i must say.	5
15248	Awesome...	5
15249	honestly saying,if u r looking for a performance oriented phone with good battery life...go for it. but if u r looking for a good camera phone..this is not for u.the camera performance is really disappointing.	3

15260	I love this new phone. I had Honor 6x before it, and I never had any complain from that phone. But I have complain from it, that it's contrast is too much and I didn't find a option to control the contrast, I can reduce brightness, or make it Warm or Cold Colour, but not play with contrast. Sometime it is too much of colour. Other than that my 6GB version is great in all sense. Don't have any problem of any sort. no heating, no lag, nothing. All works great.	4
15261	display quality is not good, sound is very less, u can't compare to note 5 Pro, don't buy this waste of money	1
15262	Back camera quality not good as per expectation.	3

15301	Its very nice and amazing machine...the slim look is pretty	5
15302	Good phone. Also camera is not good. Otherwise display is good. Small phone but big display gives hold of mobile. Display is very nice and smooth. In hand it feels like holding iphone 6. Getting good speed unlike redmi note 4. Only alternative to this phone is asus zenfone max pro M1.	4
15303	Camera quality very good	5
15304	The real camera qualities are disappointing and very average in perfomance the portrait mode doesn't work properly as it blurs the most part of the focused object as well. The front camera is very much bellow average in low light it's literally impossible to capture or record anything.A part from the camera qualities the phone is very easy to handel and the compact nature of the device gives a pretty classy look.The device weighs a bit heavy but that's not a big deal.The sound quality of the speaker's are also average.	4
15305	Superb phone, nice working	5
15306	Best phone in built quality, camera and performance except battery. No quick charger inclided bcoz the quick charger might reduce battery life.	5

15330	Battery back up too bad. Does not give 2 day battery as it claims. My earlier phone redmi 4 much better. Though camera and screen quality is good, major letdown is the battery. Just 2 days since i bought	3
15331	Iam using the back cover which is in the box when I bought.... Aprox after two months of usage.... Backside paint will be lost...I am totally disappointed with this	4

15339	Not good .... withine 2mnths of purchase it has stopped charging	1
15340	Worst mobileHeating issue	1
15341	It is great smartphone by Xiomi. The picture quality is the key factor having an amazing portrait mode feature. The sound quality is pretty good. The battery life as in most of xiomi smartphones is great.Overall this smartphone is a good option considering the budget constraints.	4
15342	Really good mobile at this price...Very powerful 2.2 ghz processor	5
15343	Sound quality is not upto the mark.	4
15344	Face recognization option is the worst part of the phone. Finger print is way more bteer option in terms of security purpose. Apart from this Amazon should realize that if they are launching anew phone they should include supporting accessories like tempered glass + mobile cover as well with their launching plan.  Its very hard to get the screen guard in local market where people are not even aware abou the new models. However the product is worth foe this price.	3
15345	The battery draining vry fast on normal usage  ..i dnt hw it is..it hv 4000mah capacity..i never had exp like this ..and camera quality also not as per expected i think redmi y2 is better than this i called amazon technician and they said to reboot after rebooting the problem still remaining same ..and when i install my mobile it had many search histories in google ..how it is?overall dissappointed	2
15346	Its awsome must and must buy its amazing camera is good look is damn awsome and every thing is just so smart and amazing must buy#	5
15347	It's a wonderful device in this price range.	5
15348	Display looking good but back camera average quality	4
15349	sab kuch ghatiya hai, I'd like to say for this phone only	1
15350	Amazon ek fault app	1
15351	One of the best phone	5
15352	"phone looks good, personally i dont have any problem with back being plastic. performance is lil low (wont affect normal users). Battery last till evening because of display and OS UNoptimizations :PHeating issue is severe because it heats from sideways and difficult to hold when its hot ... i mean REAL hot. i did not try factory reseting the phone(that might solve heating). tried replacing through amazon but no success and as per amazon customer service they tried comparing online shopping with ""local shop"" which is gross. i agree that even local shop wont provide replacement or similar thing but then why we are opting for online shopping ? anyway dont buy this if you are normal user... buy only if you are display freak !!"	3
15353	No battery backup even from the 1st day.... even Samsung j5 (2600mAh) is better after 18 months usage than this (3000mAh) newly unboxed phone	1
15354	Picture quality of phone is good and sound is also good...and battery is average but it stay at least 12 hr	4
15355	The Camera is excellent. Battery life is good. Sound quality is good. Notch display is looking good but not all apps support Notch display. Display is good. Go for it.	5
15356	Best Product at the price point of 8870	5
15357	Ordered this item after analyzing the reviews from various sources.  worth spending money on the this phone. I love it.	4

15365	Both camera are totally useless video quality is average and battery performance is good but product are different from the image on the ad	2
15366	This one thing ruins all the positives of the phone. Even on moderate usage, the phone doesn't last three-fourth of a day.	3
15367	Face unlock is not available in the device	4
15368	Totally satisfied.. value for money	4
15369	Fantastic Phone	5
15370	Value 4 money	5
15371	Everything fine. Excellent features	5
15372	Have been using it since a month works properly. It heats up a bit when using it continuously for a stretch otherwise it’s a good mobile battery last 20 hrs with good use and on power saving mode. While charging it heats a little bit. I’m using iPhone 5 & 6 even they heat up while using it continuously for a stretch and while charging.Screen resolution is good, camera is good I found it better than iPhone 6.Speaker is decent as it’s on the back side of the phone so when the phone is kept down back down the speaker volume becomes less.Touch works good.Overall a good product for mid range price.Have used Lenovo and Asus in the past. Found this Mobile bit better than them.	4
15373	Till now, everything is good.	4
15374	Battery Backup So Bad Also Memory Card Slot Not Available Also Charging Cable Is Different Than Other Mi Mobile	2
15375	Device getting hang within 2-3 days of delivery. I have stored only few pictures and apps even when device getting hang.	2

15379	Very good product. Excellent battery life. Good camera.	5
15380	This is a very good phone and very durable as well. till now i have faces no issues with this product.	5
15381	Looks is faboulous.. Selfie camera is also awesome in daylight but in artificial lighting n in night it's struggles.. Overall performance is good but it too pricy... 14000 to 15000 is right price.. But 20k is too much..	4
15382	totally satisified with design & performance and battery backup . Supercool phone thumbs up to HONOR !!!	4
15383	Good pro	5
15384	A1	5
15385	Phone is bit heavy..	4
15386	There are only 2 things to worry about this smartphone is:1: unavailability of 3.5mm jack {dongle is there}2: huge rear camera bump {requires extra care to prevent scratches on lens}If you don't care about these above mentioned points then GO FOR IT.BEST PHONE AMONG IT'S RANGE.	4
15387	Overheating within few minutes of use	2
15388	Picture quality is excellent	5
15389	It is a very average phone.. the screen always has some liness coming on it.. sound quality average.. camera quality average.. battery below average.. would not recommend	1
15390	Guys trust me ...Display and buid quality is good ... Rather than this ...nothing is good in this phone ...	3
15391	Simply superb in this price range...	5
15392	Redmi 6 pro as expected awesome	4
15393	Earphones is not working I m not good vaste of money earphones not working heating product not good product ok	5
15394	Edges are breaking . In hardl	2
15395	Front camere should be more with flash battery should more	2
15396	Front camera its very worstDesign its cute	3
15397	The ideal smart phone in the market.	5
15398	Ugly Camera is looking like 1rs coin. Otherwise unbeatable. Moto need to change this ugly coin camera	3
15399	One of the best looking phone from a trusted brand. Design, Display, Features, Sound, Construction is perfect. Face Unlock and Fingerprint Reader are as fast as expected. A little shadow below the Notch (Only visible in low brightness and with white background).NFC is missing as it is available in Other Global Variants. Software features like Double tap to on & off, Navigation Gestures, Backlight Selfie are currently missing and expected to arrive via OTA.Camera is Perfect for this price range. Lots of customizations, Pro Photo/ Video & Night mode there. Colors are not natural but it can be fixed via OTA. 4K video support is really missing.Native call recording is available too.3750 mAH battery is good. It take around 3 hrs to get Full charge because fast charging is not available and the Old USB port. Battery backup is great with EMUI optimizations.Sound output is Better than expected. Quite good enough to listening music on speaker. 3D sound with earphone is also a nice addition. It has FM radio.8x has a large 2.5D curved display and Back glass design. A Hard Plastic case is must for safety purpose but it will ruin the back shine. Also a Tampered Glass is highly recommended because there is No Gorilla Glass protection. In hand it feel like a premium flagship phone.This is the best value for money, if bought under some discount i.e. around 13K - 13.5K. The only few things missings are Type C USB Port, Fast Charging and NFC.	4
15400	Great cameras	4
15401	Good product. Great for the price. Only thing is I lost 2K festival discount for few days. So I am at a loss. But phone is great.	4
15402	Cool phone for average usage.	4
15403	excellent keka mobile	4
15404	Good cameraREAD MORE	5
15405	Bad product. Doesn't value for money. Average camera. Face unlock feature is irritating And worst part is customer services if any issue encountered, service centers looks for excuses to put the blame on you.	2
15406	Picture Quality and sound quality is very good ... but battery life is not upto the mark...	4

15417	Awesome phone, but bit delicate, got scratch on the screen just a drop of pen.Seems gorilla glass not usable at all.Other wise very good phone	4
15418	Sound quality not good, phone look awesome	4
15419	Good product by Xiomi	5
15420	Great dial	5
15421	The product is value for money at this price range, moreover it it compact and easily fits into the pocket. The battery lasts a full day almost on average/ below average usage. Camera picture quality is average. The face unlock feature works till there's sufficient light for the camera to detect your face, and the face detection and unlocking is a bit slow and  annoying at times.Another thing is the width is very low and its plainly noticeable/ felt as soon as you operate your phone in the landscape mode. The designers should have increased the width by at least a centimeter for the phone to be usable in landscape mode.	4
15422	selfie camara result very bad.	4
15423	Camera quality has to improve & ui is lagging many times whire operating	4
15424	Phone is awesomeSize is very handy and best phone under 20000	5

15435	Sound clarity super	5
15436	At this price point, this is a very outdated phone,Only pluss point is that, the 18:9 full view  screen, n nothing else......Guys, spend your bucks on something latest,not on an outdated product	1
15437	Superb no cheating love you Amazon	5
15438	It's a flawless phone with sleek design and outstanding specs. Ver much satisfied by the quality.	5
15439	"I cannot give even a single star to this phone. It is merely cheating the screen size. It says 5.5inch. but when we compare with Lenovo k4 note of 5.5 inch screen and Samsung galaxy grand 2 s 5.2inch screen , this lg q6 has very small screen size. But claiming 5.5inch screen.  The real cheat in this phone is a small mathematical calculations of an arc having radius of 5.5inches. we can get any small or big screen area of 5.5inch size. Amazon's part in this cheat is ""it hides the surface area of this phone"" in its technical spec. I lost trust on amazon by this purchase. Any way I request for a technical visit to check this phone compared with Lenovo k4 note and Samsung galaxy grand 2 at my home. Let us wait for their review.i did not expect this from a trusted brand 'LG'"	1
15440	Nice product but price is on higher side cna be reduced to budget of 12k	4
15441	Feels gereat...truely premiun albeit the plastic back panel is a disaster..so avoid fliping it in front of others.Good lg ui. Ram management works great too.happy costumer.Hope After sales service is good too.	4
15442	In box handspree and back cover not avaible	4
15443	there was no invoice enclosed with parcel	1
15444	Battery very poor and bad	2
15445	Camera quality, battery life, picture quality all are good... No issues at all.. Love this phone	5
15446	The device is good not only in look but also in performance. Huawei's Kirin 659 is powerful and efficient with 4 gb ram. The cameras are good the front cam is more good than the primary one. The price is a bit more @20k but its good if you get at an offer (I got it for 18500). Battey backup is also good.Overall its good but huawei could have included some more features.	5
15447	Class, awesome mobile	5
15448	Overall it's good smartphone for this price	4
15449	I have purchased this from amazon on 26th July. A Rs 2000 Cashback offer was issued during the purchase period. till date I haven't received any. They told over and over that within 31st dec 2018 I'll be paid the same in my bank account. 2018 is over now finally they are telling me that I'll not be given the cashback as I've ordered the phone on cash on delivery on 25th July 2018 and cancelled it and then again ordered the same on 26th July and purchased through my card as the offer was applicable on purchase through card.I think this is ridiculous. I've purchased this item when it was first launched (18,990 Rs). Such a huge amount of money and there cheap service just sucked it.There are so many people who have been cheated by this kind of Cheap service.Amazon India you are cheating people with your so called worldwide publicity.I'll go to consumer forum for this kind of cheating... let's see what they can do.So far Samsung is Samsung always the best phone for me. Just have problem with the screen auto sensor light. it doesn't really working fine.	1
15450	Cemara, screen, looks are awesome but battery, sound are average overall good a device	4
15451	It doesn't support as regards the matter of changing system fonts. Users like me wish to change the fonts of our device, and this device falls short of it. If possible, the company must give any solution for this problem through any special update.	3
15452	Front camera not good like VGA Camera	3
15453	Camera quality is very poorVideo calls are very blurredHeating issueDo not  buy this phone	1
15454	Camera features are excellent but the speakers are poor. You cannot listen to audio properly and not sure whether it is due to a software glitch. It is also not default shipped with ear phones and neither compatible with the jack pin ear phones that we are used to.	3

15501	Picture & sound quality are good but battery is worst	2
15502	Battery is good!	5
15503	Battery life. Sound not much better. Speed ok	5
15504	Camera is below average....	3
15505	OK. Why did I choose this phone?Ans:- My old phone was 2.5 years old. It battery life is getting low. Though i had a power bank i need phone which has bigger display within compact size, better battery backup, nice display, average camera, average processor, bug free user interface.So, How the phone performs?*Design is awesome. Lookwise, the phone is a beauty.* Display is superb. You should have a look @poi which is 434. Even flagship oneplus doesn't have this much pixel density. Not even note5pro,note6pro, & pocophone all have lower ppl than this.Now you can understand the display quality of this phone.* Notch:- This s d first mi phone with notch. Loving it.* Battery:- You get a good battery performance depending upon your usage. It'll give you one full day if you're a heavy user. Moderate usage ll get you 1.5 day. Low usage can deliver2 day battery as Xiaomi claims.* Camera:- Rear camera is good. Front camera is decent. Stay away if you're a camera lover. This s not for u.* Processor:- SD625 eventhogh its old its gold. does the job without lags.multitasking can be done effortlessly. Thats what i do. I don't play much games. From what ive used, i say the performance is good.* Heat generation:-(no one post this as seperate topic...lol) yes. Sometimes its getting hot while charging. But not when you put it to heavy tasking. I think im OK with it.* Fingerprint sensor is OK... But face unlock is bit unreliable...* Touch sensitivity is good though wanting more...Now coming to important topic...MIUI:-Mi is known for quality hardware with flawless software at cheaper pricetag.Nowadays it seems mi has lost that magic touch once Samsung phones believed to have(during early 2010s)...* the specs arent pleasing expect note5(6)pro( i think mi wants to sell note pro series only) other than that none of the mi phones make sense nowadays.Mi says they are making only 5% profit of their hardware sales. But that doesn't justify to permit ads in system apps(eventhough its blockable).No major change in miui.and miui10 upgrade isn't that much enjoyable in this phone. Thereare bugs. So, do not update miui10.	4
15506	So I just got this phone first impression was the display Picture quality is so good Not Tested the battery life yet but should be ok as well Seriously more than what I expected to bePros:Display is really goodIncluded Free Transparent Back CoverPicture quality is bestDual Camera in 11kHas Portrait ModeFront Is really good in looksCons:No Headphones IncludedThe Back looks as same as the mi 5 or any mi 5 phone which all look so badThe Back Is Easily Scratchable as well	5
15507	only for picture	5
15508	Good against the price nice and affordable	4
15509	Review	4
15510	It was beyond our expectation for this price. So no negatives. Love the camera. It's fast. It's worth buying for this price range.	5
15511	Sound quality and battery life is not so good . But the phone is very good and value for money	5
15512	Very be mobile performance is very bad even it's software not works good I never suggest to buy this product anyhow ,if you buy then you waste your money....	1
15513	If you are not a spec geek and want one of the greatest android experiences then this phone is for you. Turbo charger, glass back, good cameras, good display, quality speaker, usb C and a good pair of headphones. They should have given a case like they do in other countries.	5
15514	Pathetic product	1

15529	Over all this is a good choice,sound quality is good,Processer also good,bt the camera is avarage,and battery backup also verry good,if anyone want overall good phone then you will go for it bt if anyone want good camera quality then you will go for other phone.	5

15533	Best audio quality , best camera in range of 15k ,(got in Amazon sale)... Android one phone with sd660 best combo...compared it with realme2 pro...it just lacks battery life thanks to fast charger charges phone in  1 hr approx where as realme2 pro takes 3 hours😂...apart from that it's king in price segment till now...hope you like it ...	5
15534	Some apps like dual app and one hand operations is missing	5
15535	I used one month not compare to any other model	5
15536	🤩🤩🤩	5
15537	after 15 mins of continous use it is getting extremely hot.kindly suggest a solution.	2
15538	This phone is really cool its looks, features just spectacular😁, everything is perfect even the sound too i found it very good, talking about the notch with it it gives you a i phone feel , overall in this budget its worthy , i purchased it on exchange with my old mi phone...for me it was awesome deal i got it just in 7900only.	5
15539	Good phone but the camera is really bad.. Other rest is cool.. Plz improve on the camera	3
15540	"Overall the phone is a good package.Really happy to have chosen an android one phone. But that said, it does have its own little issues.My phone usage is below normal, so i did not find any battery drainage issue, but having said that, the phone does heat up a little while charging.Also, like everyone i had an issue with the proximity sensor, it just doesn't function.I think its more of a callibration issue, than a software bug.I did find a way to bypass that, Just deactivate the option ""Power Button ends call"" and when you know your call is going to be longer than usual, just lock the screen, it would not light again until you press the power button.And yes! We seriously take the headphone jack for granted, The lack of a headphone jack was really irritating.Tip: The camera bump is huge, make sure you choose a case that covers the camera bump completely."	4

Camera- primary camera setup is really good and secondary camera is quiet interesting, but I haven't used the camera in dark conditions. I can recommend this phone to anyone searching under 13000.	4

15550	Disappointed with LG and Amazon. Got the device today and tried the camera app. The phone started heating up and I was afraid that it might explode in ny hand. Locked the screen and tried again after some time, but again the heating started. Called the customer care to return the phone, but it looks like they accept returns only if the temperature exceeds 44.5 degree celsius. I was told that a complaint(550154411) has been raised but nobody contacted me after that. I installed a temperature app and saw the temperature going up to 41.7 degree celsius with only the camera app open. Should the device actually explode for it to be eligible for a return? Never expected this from Amazon.	1
15551	Android One lover here it is. Best camera in segment. 660 Snapdragon processor. Battery life is average for heavy users, may be sort out after Android pie update	4

15564	Don’t waste your money in other brands. MI gives you everything in your budget.Please MI don’t waste your money in advertisements because you are great no need to advertise.  If you do that u will increase price of every product that’s why i am saying.  If u r making a great product in low budget thn u don’t need to advertise. advertise works rarely u can tale example of vivo. They wasted so much money in advertising like they sponsored IPL, Kabaddi Premier League. But still no one is Interested in buying vivo or Oppo phones. I m proud MI user	5

Sound out put while hearing using USB dongle is almost less than 50% from Mi 1 ,  in Mi 1 the  same song with same earphone i  used to listen at 50% volume and in mi 2 i hv to raise till 80% and that too sound very flat.2. Another factor , in mi 1 we can see the  notification while swiping down the finger print scanner which was small but very  useful  feature  but  this is not available in mi 2 so every time you have to use another hand  and its become very uncomfortable bcz mi 2 is taller than mi 1.3. Now the camera , front camera of mi a2 is awesome  , mi a1 is no where near to it but but portrait  mode is where  the issue is , low light photo are good in a2 but while taking portrait pic in a1 it automatically zoomed  bcz of optical zoom lens and delivery awesome quality in fact from A1 i was able to capture 5 ppl pic in portrait mode with any issue but in a2 it took long to focus on even two ppl and you have to come really close to the ppl to capture perfect shot , more over in mi a1 portrait mode was very bright and gives excellent photos which is not the case in A2.So my opinion A2 is not a bad phone but differently not worth to upgrade from a1	1
15580	Amazon's marketing is upto date.	1
15581	Great phone to buy	5
15582	i like. worth being samsung	5
15583	Good function because head phone point is not there	4
15584	Worst one	1
15585	5.5 inch Display is very small,camera quality is average front and rear.Build quality is great and solid, full hd plus display quality is excellent and more clear and vivid than expectations.But mobile back side is plastici so you expect more scratches on back side,back cover needed,phone design is beautiful and charmy also full vision display experience is great but small size full vision display is not give full satisfaction.Performance is not a good not a worst.good for daily task but not good for heavy usage.battery life is great for all day but fast charging not supported that's why you need to wait 2 hour for full changing 10 to 100.If you want full vision display with excellent crisp and vivid full hd plus quality and you are ready to compromise with fingerprint,fast charging,camera quality so go and buy this phone now.	3
15586	its rough and tough , working fine so far, batt backup is good , sound quality on ear phones is great and display is also great.	5
15587	Picture and sound quality fine. Full vision a treat for the eyes. Other features as expected. But set heats up sometimes after continuous use. Battery drains faster than normal. Overall a good phone.	4

15589	Super.  . .	4
15590	Only problem is the dual app of all apps. But overall it is a very good mobile at recent brands and models.	4
15591	Fantastic mobile.	4

15593	nice mobile and fast deliveryREAD MORE	5
15594	As on the date, November 18, this was the best phone after applying all the offers and keeping the budget range in limit... After narrowing down 2 smartphone giants, xiaomi mi A2 and Honor 8x, I went for Honor 8x as i was ready to compromise a liiiiiiitle bit of picture clarity, coz it was a software issue and not hardware, whereas as the cons of Mi were all hardware related like the smalllest battery in range... Who wants an all time dying battery.... Moreover, the screen of 8X...nothing to say abt it... It looks amazing... Just flaunting it now... So yea... This was the review by far.	5
15595	Great Display	5
15596	overall phone is good but active dual 4g sim feature is a feature that u are definitely going to miss	4
15597	Only the battery backup is less, but if you are an indoor person then it won't be a problem for you. Charging is fast enough to full its charge from 20-80 within 30-40 minutes. If your budget is around 15k then you can go for it, it won't be disappointing.	4
15598	Superb phone.. screen like galaxy s8 but not curved... very beautiful and fast phone .	5
15599	Except in portrait mode all other things are below the standard. U need to hold after u click the capture button.	2
15600	The phone is hanging, then it automatically shut off. Its hardly a month and I am facing this issue.	1
15601	Everything goes fine. but, After usage of 1hour, mobile gets heated up.	4
15602	I was buy it 15 days ago but initially its display is nice i mean very beautiful and it is a good looking device good battery .But after 15 days dont know how its display is cracked at the upper corner and im trying to contact to amazon but no rply from amazonThis is not good at all .	1
15603	Very handy. Smart looking!	5
15604	I love redmi	5
15605	Camera clarity - 0.3mp camera takes picture better than this phoneLot of lagging even though it has 4 gb ramSoftware issues	1
15606	Nothing is more important than objects really	1
15607	"The phone certainly looks good.Positives:Small form factor.Good quality displaySimple OSNo heating issues (usually heats while charging, that is normal though)Charging time is decent.So-So:Battery LifeCamera quality (Both)Negative:Face recognition is just a gimmick. Its slow and it may not work most of the time. Its not a substitute for finger print scanner.I would not comment on the gaming potential as I donot play games on my phone. Anyway weak processor for gaming!By the way just for your information, this phone is ""made in India""Overall it serves my purpose and I am satisfied."	4
15608	Fabulous phone	5
15609	Tghg	3
15610	I purchased this for my mom great product camera quality is awesome, the only thing is that you have to compromise with the headphone jack.	4
15611	This is the phone I have ever bought... Must buy	5
15612	Excellent product with stock android.	5
15613	Super phone.	5
15614	Went against the odds even after heating issue reported by multiple users.10 mins usage is making the device hot.Lg should look into this.	1
15615	Pretty small device. Works just flawlessly. Too cute to hold it in hand.  Provide regular updates which is the best thing for a Android device.Till now no problem at all.	5
15616	Battery charging time Mobile get's very hot contact Store but say this product problem with everyone	4
15617	Wrost battery life i ever seen,never buy this phone if u r average or high user,this phone battery is quickly down.	2
15618	I like this phone a lot... At this price segment this is the best smart phone.. Multi tasking, web browsing, watching video are best experience on this phone. However few area like sometime network issue exist, youtube and other video player does not have full screen view..still day in day out you will enjoy using this phone	5
15619	Superb featuresVery nice phone	5
15620	Awesome phone with its super build quality.1. Phone speed is awesome in terms of software2. Brightness is lovely as iPhone x3. Edges are not curved as vivo v9 and xiaomi note 5 Pro4. It Is so luxurious like iPhone x5. On paper battery is small on no but it works fineProblems in phone1. No image stabilisation2. Headphone are awful u can replace with its back cover3. Camera features are trickyConcerning after using it some features can be add like image stabilisation, easy to use feature like bokeh mode after software update.4. Lowlights images are not gud as image stabilisation is missingPeople who are complaining for the back cover is so poor. Before buying u can read no backcover is included. Givin65stars because all problems can be solve after software update otherwise 4 star	5

15625	I bought this phone and was happy to have it till the replacement period was not over. As soon as return time got over, the phone started facing battery draining issues following the immediate day. And fingerprint sensor is worst in this smartphone it is slow and cannot read fingerprint at first touch.Feeling sick to have this phone.😓	3

15637	Delivery was done in 24 hrs. Swapped my Samsung Galaxy S7 with this phone. But this display is very good but not as good as Amoled. I was scared that Nokia will be more of a square phone but it's design is as similar to galaxy. Can be easily handled with 1 hand and not to heavy. It is a very premium looking phoneNotch is smaller, but lower bezel is more cause of branding.Phone has a mirror finish quality. it feels good to hold and is very slippery.Android one is light and fast.

Display quality of mobile is very bad, clearly seen pixels on the screen at time of streaming videos3. intensity of sound is good but quality of sound is worst.4. Length is good but the width of the mobile is shorter as expected.5. Font recognition option is not working well	2

15648	I've been using for it over 7 months. The camera quality is good and sound quality is also Okay. But battery life is not good. Even when it was new the battery used to last for about 10-11 hours (normal usage). But now after about 6 months, the battery dies in about 4 hours and also it is not in warranty for the battery so I need to pay for it to be repaired.	3
15649	Processor worstSurely very disappointed	2

15658	Product is very good to use	5
15659	very good performance	5
15660	Amazon service was fast in delivering as usual but Not worth this price.. Display and touch is pretty good.. Comfortable in holding, light weight..But now comes the main issues..- Camera is not up to the mark- Its like a heating machine.. Even if u r doing some normal tasks like surfing or using camera  or increase the brightness of screen or doing one or two task or charging....... Anything.. It will start heating and upto a level that one can't hold more than a minutes..- battery drains too fast..Have requested to return the same..	2
15661	I wanted a phone for college which is powerful enough so I can play most of the games and stylish enough to stand out from the sea of Chinese, cheap looking smartphones. When i was choosing between phones I was a bit concerned on how will this perform on the gaming end as the processor GPU combination is not the latest.Coming to gaming aspect, The highest settings for PubG is Medium on Balanced.Asphalt 9 and Infinity Ops run Good on Highest settings.The battery is small but it won't be a concern because of Fast Charging.It does attract fingerprints but they all go away if you wipe it with a cloth.The portrait mode is not that good in matter of edge detection.If you ask my opinion I would recommend Moto G6 over Redmi Note 5 Pro, to say the Redmi note 5 does have a bigger battery and is more powerful but it's not that big of a difference as being more powerful it consumes more power, also it doesn't have a fast charger include in the package so at the end of the day both are at the same page, my final say on this being if you want a little more smooth gaming and camera performance go with Redmi Note 5 Pro and if you want good overall quality with regular software updates go with Moto G6. ( To add Motorola has approved Android 9 Pie update for Moto G6 )	4
15662	One of the best buget mobile but there is no finger. Print option...	4
15663	Such a nice phoneSlim, light weight, good quality of camera and batterySlove motion video capture is a nice featureCamera is goodFlash is goodAnd overall mobile is best	5
15664	But.. customer service is worste... otherwise product is very satisfied.low sound quality.good work finger print lock.	5
15665	An amzing buy.. Solves the purpose for me as i always want a handsome phone. Battery camera and other features are also good to go with. Fingerprint and cast screen is lacking but ya price is also less.A premium feeling is there which is lacking in those high spec mi phones at same price	5
15666	Best Price best Phone	5
15667	Facing Battery issue...its draining fastly	3
15668	Average phone with avarage performance. But pricing is very good.	4
15669	Great phone to buy.  Phone quality is awesome.	5
15670	Poor Apps ,I have a used other android Mobiles . it was really or completely poor applications in Mi A2 Mobile compare to other.It was not Import or Export Messages OptionNo Message Pinning OptionNo Contacts optionsPoor RingtonesNo Microsoft Office's apps in builtDisplay menu options was not goodNo themesNot availibilty of Wallpaper or Background display download optionAnd so onSome mobile swipe to call but this mobile calling option was TragedyIt is only for Camera purpose	1
15671	Front camera bad.. phone display average, call time speaker sound low.	2
15672	Very good product. No doubt.	4
15673	It's amazing phone but I don't like notch in this phone I think some of them or liked and in honor phones they want to give good battery life because  I am used honor 6x it's also not having good battery life but it's amazing ,honor 7x also is good better then the honor 6x but it's all basically they have some problems in any phone I don't think any phone have three own problems but itEasy to hold and operate with one hand.DISPLAY: FHD+ and a notch makes it very immersive. Very crisp and sharp for text.Contrast levels are great with deep blacksAlthough a AMOLED panel would have been even better.PROCESSOR:  When I brought this device, Nova 3i was not launched, Nova 3i @21k comes with a Kirin 710 a 12nm processor (equivalent to Sanpdragon 660).For the current price of P20 lite, Kirin 659 a 16nm processor is a disappointment but, it performs well in day to day multi taking and is considered to outperform Sanpdragon 625.RAM: About 2.7 GB is free and available at all the time of switching on, multitasking is buttery smooth. With multiple apps in background, I did not see free available RAM going down below 2.3 GB, great job with RAM MANAGEMENT HuaweiSTORAGE: About 51GB is availableREAR CAMERA: Camera is OK, decent.Slom motion is capped at VGA resolution.There is no IMAGE STABILIZATIONShutter and focusing speed is good.FRONT CAMERA: No front flash nor even an option for screen flash (white screen)Edge detection needs improvement.OS: EMUI feels snappy and smooth. Very rarely experienced lag in UI transition or otherwise it was all smooth with multi tasking too.I think Huawei provides bimonthly security patches, so far I received 1st June 2018 security patch.I am not sure of guaranteed Android P and later stage updates.CHARGING: Is quick, takes approx 1.5 hrs for 0 to 100, the phone slightly heats up.ACCESSORIES:1.In box headset is average quality.2. No case or screen protector is provided. It is very hard to find a slim case which does not spoil the compact and slim form factor of the phone, luckily I found one https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07CYRX863?ref=yo_pop_ma_swfThis is the best one, very slim, doesn't feel like a case at all but gives all the protection needed.Screen guard (tempered glass) is also difficult to find one of exact size as otherwise the beauty of notch is compromised. The 2.5D curved glass will leave a line of air gap between screen and tempered glass along the edges of phone.Wish Huawei have their own official accessories.BATTERY: It is OK, not as long lasting as expected.OTHER POINTS:1. The LED Notification light is too small and dim to be noticed during dy time (indoors too)2. There is no double to wake or lock, it is annoying since every time you need to lift the phone to use fingerprint scanner at the back.3. Phone heats up a bit, with extensive data usage on cellular network (example, YouTube videos)4. NO GROLLIA GLASS PROTECTION.5. Pulling down on any part of screen will not bring down the notification panel unlike in Mi devices, which I feel is very useful for tall phones.6. There is no volume adjustment in notification panel which is very useful (LG users will know what I am talking about)7. Has a inbuilt health app which counts the steps, not sure how it is working for me showing steps walked and calories burned without using any fitness band. Steps counting is 90% accurate.8. This is not a true dual VOLTE phone (meaning it won't support two 4G SIMs at a time to run)9. Screen resolution can be changed to 720p HD or 1080p FHD, former one being a power saving option.10. Fingerprint scenner is blazing fast.	5

15687	I purchased this by exchanging my old Samsung S duos 2 which was 4 years old and had expected to keep that phone in a museum as it had served me so well all these years (although I had rooted it)... Never thought that it would sell beyond 500 bucks... Then came LG Q6.. and everything fell in place for me.. I got an additional exchange offer of 3000 plus amazon gave me 617 rupees for that phone.. so in total 3617 plus 1500 cash back on sbi credit card as I purchased from the amazon app..

15747	amazing battery and displayI'm confused Asus max pro m1 and mi note 5 pro and moto one power    finally i selected this one.rear and front cameras are decent but not greatspeaker quality very decent not very loudly and Dolby audio nicei like very much on fingerprint sensor moto logobattery life was normal usage 2 daystotally very awesome on this oneREAD MORE	5
15748	I have purchased this mobile on its launch date with exchange offer. I got a this at very good price around 14k after exchange.Overall this product performance is good. Camera is good especially front camera. Face detection and fingers sensors response is fast.	4
15749	Primary Camera :-Bad camera	4
15750	Xiaomi phones are totally waste of money	1
15751	Facing issue, it's only 1 one month I purchased this phn and once I lock this phn it automatically switch I visit service center they updated software but still facing problem	1
15752	Over all Good product.	4
15753	Awesome mobile but only ther is no dual cam otherwise awesome	4
15754	Camera bad	5
15755	All is superbGuys... Perfect job... Thank you so much for making feel so alive having this...Its just wana thank you guys on phone too..	5
15756	Wifi and Bluetooth Quality is really low. Wifi connectivity is worst I have seen. Parents own Redmi 4 and they have better connectivity at the same spot in house. Not expected in 17k phone.	3
15757	Best bazel less phone, awesome perfomance, great battery life, plays games without lag.	5
15758	Nice phone Battery life is nice	4
15759	Looks:  Pros: sleek, beautiful and graceful ... Feels nice to hold  Con: Metallic back starts loosing Matt effect because of dust that gets stuck in sftey coverCamera:  Pros: Nice dynamic range, good camera quality in low light as well for this budget, quick focus, equivalent quality of front camera  Con: lag while taking photograph from front camera in portrait mode only, slow motion videos editing is messy.Battery:  You need to be cautious with that, it doesn't house a battery enough for a device with such specs. After 1 month of use a complete battery lasts for 6-7 hours with a mix use of gaming, listening musinc and surfic over web, and roughly 25% ideal.Performance:  So far Chipset has not made me reget the decision. Whether it being playing asphalt or and any other game with running music in background or rendering adobe premier projects the device holds on to the fame.In House Speaker:  It is loud but quality is not that good... Buy a music system along with a nice headset for that, instead of spending 18 grands more to buy a better handset :POther Pros:- has IR remoteOther Cons:- no 3.5mm jack- no expandable memory- big camera hump at back	4
15760	Don't buy if you are looking for a good camera phone, 24 mp front camera is not that great, images are sometimes blurred and back camera worse in low light, the video does not have EIS support, so it is shaky. No fast charging, it takes 1:45-2 hrs just to charge a small 3000 Mah battery.	3
15761	It have awesome sharp selfi Camera.. Best in 16000k phones.. Back cam is average... Struggle in low light.. 1.45 minutes to full charge.. Battery lasts for one day.. Little heat issue while playing games.. Lot of cool features.. Lite weight... I think its Better than vivo v9 and honor 9n.. One drawback 2nd sim is 2G	5
15762	Good phone for the price it is offered at, nice display, good battery life	5
15763	Using it for more than 2 weeks.Very satisfied.I dropped it by mistake from big height on floor but nothing happened to screen. True to its build quality.Thanks LG	5

15795	Ph not charge when on only charge when switched off may be hardware or software problem	3
15796	LH Best in it's class with square mode option & 18:9 Future ready technology.	5
15797	Battery - Battery life is too good, it lasts one full day with heavy usage like playing pubg and watching videos.Camera - Though my first impression was bad but after I disabled the AI and changed few settings, the camera is pretty good. The highlight is super slow motion and night mode.Display - This is where it stands out in the crowd, its perfect.Performance - I am using the 4gb ram variant and there is no lag, it handles everything you throw at it.Don't think twice, just go fit it 👍	5
15798	The back body is plastic which made it cheap w.r.t the price it charged. And again the frame is also delicate and give you the feel of plastic and not aluminium. Rest is ok but the price should be between 15000-17000.	3
15799	Speaker sound very low even with high volume. Battery drained very fast	4

15831	Bakbash products  hai bhai sim slot ke pass kafi garam hota hai,	4
15832	This is my third honor phone after 6X and 9 lite. While it's a major upgrade in built quality, screen display & size, battery life, there are scope of improvement in Camera and sound quality. 9 lite's dual front cameras were better. While the price tag doesn't allows too many high end specs, having a notch with 6.5 inches display, dual sim + memory card support, AI enabled camera with panorama effect are really good to have features. I also wish phones with 3500+ mAh batteries supports fast charging. Overall, value for money to have 8X, won't hesitate to recommend it to my friends.	4
15833	It is an awesome phone at this price, awesome features, clarity of sound and pictures.	5

Native video call option missing. I hope honor will provide updates to fix camera and native video call. Close your eyes and go for it, great value for money.	5
15892	Used Samsung and iPhone mobiles, my first time experience with MI... exceptionally good	5
15893	nice one . Superb., No doubt..	4
15894	Happy with it so far. Still pictures are amazing in daylight. Potrait mode is very nice. Liked the extra camera features like light painting, star trails, food settings etc. Screen is nice. 3d sound setting for headphones. Only EIS is missing fir video shooting. Battery last for 24-36 hrs at moderate usage. One of the best phone in 15k.	5
15895	I got a good deal on Amazon after exchanging my old mobile and over that getting 10% HDFC cash back with No cost EMI so got at 7,600/- approx. Display is very good, Slim & Compact size, UI is very smooth and fast responsive. Ample RAM is free. Camera is good in daylight and indoors is ok. Not tested in low light conditions. At charging back is getting little hot. But Q6 has 28nm CPU instead of 14nm processor,else I wud hav given a 5star. Bought this for my mother. Here is what I got when ran AIDA64 app on this mobile to check it's genuineness.	4

Good battery easily comes for a day6. Got this mobile for nice deal at 12.5k with exchange of old pgoneCon1. Back cover should have been included2. Fast charger should have been includedI understand for cutting down cost fast charger and back cover are not included. But good exchange deal and instant discounts on cards makes it worth.But finding best cover and screen guard is difficult.I got one from, 'Smartlike' brand combo. Fits good.. Attached pics. If you are OK go for the same brand for back cover.	4
15932	Best phone used till date.	5
15933	I have been using this phone since 2 days and here's what i feel about it.Pros :- 1) Good built2) Quality display!! Its screen is just love.3) Above average camera. Front is good though4) No lags despite the lower end snapdragon chipset. ( Haven't tested heavy gaming yet )5) Good battery backup. Lasts one whole day with quite heavy usage.5) Beautiful looksCons :- 1) Heating issues without any heavy usage.2) Not having fast charge sucks. Takes long to charge3) Back of the phone is fully made of plastic so it adds up to the heating issue4) Speaker isn't loud enough to hear it in publicSo whether to go for it or not? -Gamers stay aside.Music lovers can go for it but make sure you have good headphones/earphones. LG's earphones aren't that impressive.Photogenic people; sure go for it!To conclude, it's a good phone for the price you are paying. You won't regret unless you are a gamer.	4

15989	Very good pictures &sond	4
15990	I got my phone today, undoubtedly the camera beats all other competitors, stunning clarity and it provides awesome performance while playing high graphics games.But I'm highly disappointed when i came to know that it doesn't have an external memory slot. Only A2 Lite has an expandable memory slot. The buyer has to satisfy with internal memory ( 64GB in my case ) or has to go with cloud storage option.Surprisingly, this information doesn't available on their product page/ here.  Now, it's too late for me and I'm thinking about my decision to go for this phone.	2
15991	Does not provide acreen protector and charger cable is very short..	4
15992	I like camera quality, but i don't like it's quality. Speaker built quality Very poor.	3
15993	Best mobile in 10k awesome display	5
15994	Crystal Clear Display. Sound quality is not bad. Amazing battery life. I think they better change the processor SD 625 to 636 in this price segment....	4
15995	I want invoice copy of this moblie	3
15996	During call sensor problem I'm getting. It activets torch, camera so on . Sensor issue they has to fix..	3
15997	This is my review for usage of two months for this phone On papers this very decent phone,  The brand LG ask you to pay more amount compare to others but this cannot be used as a primary device for anyone it can only be used has secondary or standby device.  You will not be able to expect more from this phone, camera is okay  other functions and usage and storage is fine and it’s normal as other phones nothing bad or nothing special  to  appreciated .I use this phone as my secondary phone I don’t use much of this phone based on this everything is okay.  For  me that’s not a problem but the battery drains very soon .  And your left hand side back panel gets heated for a span of 30 minutes of regular usage of anything if maybe YouTube Facebook “you may be working on your phone anything. left hand side back panel gets heated very soon and if you’re thinking this as your primary device please do not go for this if you think you need an brand like in LG with low-priced phone  18:9 screen full HD  then u can make call on this .But don’t buy if  it’s your primary device	2
15998	Look for better option	2
15999	Phone looks and feels pretty much premiumBattery backup is worth it but not when you play games drains 12% to 14% in half an hour but YouTube and browsing drains just 7-8% per hour and it charges like 60% to 80 in 15 mins able to run 2-3 heavy applications in background (Camera sucks) this phone is not for camera lovers but value for money can't deny kirin 710's performance and several super useful features are just awesome.. BTW I have dropped the phone right away out of the box but nothing happened phone is bit slippery and heavy but its beautiful though	4
16000	Except camera, everything is DOPE	4
16001	😘😘👌👌👌	5
16002	I have been using this fpr over a month now it works fine, specs are same as redmi note 4 but it has a notch, so looks good.	4
16003	Worst smart mobile in my life in term of camera and well as its tremendous heating problem.	1
16004	This mobile have problem its very hang,	5
16005	Worst battery life	4
16006	I was very confused while buying Honor 8X BUT now I would say that I did the right decision to buy it.  Camera is awesome, Battery life is as expected good, very good phone in less price.  Wonderful feeling while watching Prime videos and Netflix.	5
16007	Nice piece is art by Honor @ ₹15k	5
16008	ABOUT  BATTERY LIFE  AND DURABILITY OF PHONE ..IT DEPENDS  ON  OUR USEAGE OF PHONE NICE  AND FAST CHARGING	5
16009	Everything is cool but camera quality is not that good.....but in that price it is good....	5
16010	Nice MOBILE in all aspects	5
16011	Batter backup is not so good	5
16012	The battery is not at all reliable. and nothing new features. but in portrait mode the focus affect is not of good quality.	2
16013	The screen to body ratio is low.	5
16014	Excellent touch, the bezel less view looks great. Would have like ram to be atleast 4-6gb considering its a dual sim. Dont mind paying extra for that.All in all a very good phone for the 13k.	4
16015	Nice look but body ratio some small other phone	4
16016	Plz don't buy this product .box is open not sealed and all accessories is missing inside the box	1
16017	Received this on 16th May'18. Excessive heating problem of complete hand set, 40 degree C while charger connected. And it becomes so hot even with normal use in open sunny day use, though standing in shade, had to switch off, becomes so much intolerable. Returning the set become an issue with Amazon because as per supplier's company specification 48 degree C is the permissable temperature. So please HOLD BACK if you are thinking to buy it. Wait for our further reviews of how company addresses our issues. Regarding camera already reviews are available on net, and should limit your expectations accordingly. Otherwise built is good, application s running smoothly.	3
16018	notch display under 10K,go for it. battery life not good as MI note 4.	4
16019	Very poor network, bad sound quality,bad network quality, camera is too dull, pls amazon you are one of the good online shopping centre pls don't show faulty piece and faulty products..	1

16027	Got at 16.5K but in 2 months  it was reduced to 15K. So it's bit disappointed.3.5 Jack is not there, but you can use C To 3.5 jack cable.Battery is ok last till day.QC3.0 charger not in box.Android One hence don't expect MIUI feature (Request to check before buying).Updates are late as it is Xiaomi.Google promised for Q as well.Finally Best Camera Phone in price (Reason to buy this phone). Since two months there is no update actually don't care security update. But need bug fixes atleast post upgrade from 9.0. since two months phone is lagy and surpringly lowest camera, sound, charging issue are different...	1

16043	I like the design display n camera bt sad for didn't support 4k recordings and no stabiliser in video footage...	5
16044	1. Looks and design is good2. Battery life is satisfactory. With normal usage you will get 1 day battery life.3.loudspeaker not so loud.4. No default video call option in dialer5. Display color are oversaturated especially red color but no youtuber mentioned it in thier review6. Poor camera performance. Totally disappointed.  On paper it looks great but practically it not upto the mark.Detail and clarity is missing.Different modes with different pixel size.On rear camera normal photo mode uses 20 MP , AI mode uses 12 MP, portrait mode uses 8MP and other modes uses 8MP only. Poor quality pictures.Also disappointed with night mode feature.Night mode uses only 8MP and quality & clarity is wrost.Video is limited to 1080P 60fps but again quality is poor. Even in 1080p video looks like pixelated and detail is missing.Slow motion is limited to 720P again no detail no clarity.No EIS support.Rear camera potrait mode uses 8MP only whereas front camera potrait mode uses 16MP don't know why.First experience with honor and it is not good.Realme 2 pro is better than 8X in terms of camera.	2
16045	Excellent device with amazing offers on amazon. It's looks premium device as compared to cheap chinese brands.I like it's full vision display and its compact size that fits in my hand while typing and traveling. Stunning performance with good battery backup.I feel the absence of fingerprint sensor but face unlock is way better and stylish feature in this range.Overall good for this affordable, but premium device.	5
16046	amazing experience with this gadget.	5

16051	Really good product in less price. I got it at 9700 after replacing my moto g5s+.Screen resolution is very good.Both primary and secondary cameras provide good quality pictures.Battery lasts almost one and half day with continuous Internet use(jio 4g) and some light gaming.Only thing I don't like is they should provided dash charging. It takes almost 2 and half hour to fully charge.	5
16052	It's beauty with strong build. Best display FHD+ with best ppi. Best in this price and offers.	5

16060	This phone is good in all sections except battery & 3.5mm audio jack. Night mode photography is not upto that mark which they show in advertisements. Photos in daylight conditions are good. Heats a bit when charging, playing heavy games like PUBG etc.	4
16061	So durableCamera quality is good	4
16062	Super budget phone	4
16063	Beautiful phone. The picture quality is not good.The battery life is very good. It lastsfor a day. Overall a good phoneat the price.The face unlock works even in low light.	5
16064	The picture quality is worst than its predecessor MI A1.	3

16070	Nice camera and battery	4
16071	Horrible piece of junk. Within a week the display gets frozen, automatically apps get activated,  as if someone is touching the apps at the same time. Very bad decision to go for this horrible stupid Chinese junk	1
16072	Camera is not best at night	5
16073	Waste camera quaity , immense heat is generating while browsing and afetr turning on the data it was taking couple of minutes to turn on the data . Overall its the worst product	1
16074	Battery life is too bad	4
16075	Phone has good quality screen, might feel big to some people. Battery life is good. Camera is not so well and no notification LEDs are there. Altogether, in this price range, it is worth for those who want a performance phone rather than a DSLR embedded in phone.	4
16076	Look and feel is good but the camera is ok you get average pictures with front and back camera.Speakers are good and battery is awesome	3
16077	I am very happy with this phone - 13 K is nothing when you see its features, and most important thing is its blue light filter. Its very safe for your eyes too.	5
16078	Phone good in this range	4
16079	Except front camera all is goodd	4
16080	Battary life is awesome.... And unbelievable camera...	5
16081	Over all phone is fine. This phone is for camera lover. Battery backup poor,Not for heavy use.. there is no headphone jack in phone,	2
16082	I've been using this phone for about 2 months now and I literally regret buying it! This phone is not recommended at all to anyone. I'll tell you all the problems existing even after December 05 security update on Android Pie.Problems (which people don't usually talk about) :1) Auto-brightness sensor is terrible, it stays dim all the time (this is the first phone in my life on which I have turned off the auto brightness)2) Proximity sensor is also bad, screen keeps on turning on and off while calling (sometimes flash turns on accidentally by the ears touching the screen)3) Haptic Feedback has a very high intensity, there's no way to control its intensity, just pressing any of the navigation button will vibrate the entire phone.4) There's no customization option in the default launcher, so I had to switch to Nova Prime Launcher as I had to hide apps.5) I don't have any idea why this phone hangs sometimes (for 1-2 minutes complete freezing) atleast once in every 2 or 3 days even after having SD660!6) Photos do come out to be great but video quality is definitely below average, it tries to stabilise the video but then the details are completely lost while EIS is under operation!7) Camera bump is too much, bezels are also too thick on the top and bottom!	3
16083	Guys go for it... Awesome mobile for this price range... Excellent screen quality n slim design...got very good discount for my old exchange mobile.. Front camera quality was awesome back one its OK not best.... Battery stand only for one day which is one drawback I felt... Overall mobile for 20k its worth...	4
16084	No 3.5mm jack battery is not good	5
16085	Rear camera 8.5/10Front camera 10/10Battry backp 10/10Prccsr 10/10Sound 10/10  Rear camera8.5 to rear camera bec not satisfied with details of camera when uh zoom. Pics are awesom but when uh zoom details are not that much satisfactry....  Front camera10 for it because pics are much clear n also well details can be seen  Batry backupWell to be honest batry backup is good but previously i was using asus zenphone max no brand's battry can be comprble to that.  ProcessrNo words... its superb u can blindly trust playng pubg n war robots is like u r playng any 2- 3 mb game it was so smooth.....  SoundSome people are giving negtv commnts about sound but i m in love with its  music and when i connctd it to my speakr it won my heart. 😍😍At last i wanna say that little update in its camera will make it mindblowng but still camera is awesome... Go for itFace unlockng n fingrprnt sesnor is very very  fast....Notifctn led is there too.....Chrgng time is 2.5hrs+	5

16100	Best mobile 📱 phone under 15000 👌👌	5
16101	If you are looking for good camera phone, plz avoid. The display is not so WOW. Rest battery back up is good ,design is awesome, looks premium on your hand.	3
16102	"i would like to give no stars for this product and also to the amazon store. one more fail product from samsung. the battery performance is pathetic as it would take literally 4 hrs to get 100% charged and the charging would last hardly 20hrs without any usage. I have asked amazon customer service to take the product and refund the product as there are performance issue with the product. the touch of the mobile is dead slow that you cant even end the phone cal or even receive any phone call. ""PLEASE FORGET ABOUT MULTI-TASKING"". when you request the customer care regarding the phone issue and refund, they will start throwing their attitude on you and some policies on your face. they would say that technician will come and check the phone and they rely on their responses and will be least bothered about customers concerns. and i started facing the problem since the very first day, and all hail to customer care executives that they blame you for not liking the mobile its not their fault and they are least bothered about your customer review. and the best part is they even have scratches on the phone where the box is perfectly finei demand for the phone pick up and refund for the mobile."	1
16103	Good phone. Good processor and battery life but brightness is not satisfactory in outdoor condition..	4
16104	Flagship phone, amazing camera	5
16105	love it.. the display is amazing and everything is generally good. However, the LG UI/UX can be improved. It's not a big deal tho...	5
16106	Not worth for 15k. You can get same features with in 8 to 10 k in other brands.	3
16107	I need bill for this product	5
16108	Phone got a price drop of 1500 rs in a week not hapy with that	3
16109	Battery life is very poor, full charge lasts for just few hours with moderate usage of Apps and Phone	2
16110	Nice mobile.......	4
16111	Only battery is goodRest the screen and color and quality is way way behind wrt its specifications	1
16112	Good product for personal use	5
16113	Good Awesome	5
16114	Writing this review after 15 days of usage.Firstly the Amazon service was great, ordered at 10pm and received at 9am the next day(That too a sunday !).Packing was fine.The moment I handled the phone I was quite surprised with the premium quality.It was too good for this price with metallic body.I stress on the fact that this is way too premium than it was mentioned elsewhere.It is slightly heavier(Not a concern) than any other regular phone due to the metallic body around it.I loved the FullVision or Widescreen which again gives a premium effect and much more pleasing while using the mobile.The videos looks stunning in the Full HD display.Regarding the Face recognition, It works perfectly.You are required to sync your face for ONCE and then continue using it.Although it was working fine, sometimes my face isn't recognized(Or takes time).To set this thing, sync your face for the second time which would enhance the capability to recognize your face.After syncing twice, I almost never had to type my Pin again.Face recognition is perfect !CAMERA: This is strictly not for people who'd love taking pictures of VERY HIGH QUALITY.The phone has a very decent camera which brings out pictures definitely with quality but not for one who is a picture freak.The front camera is again good for selfies and stuff.Moreover it has a wide range front camera, when chosen Widerange(Normal range is the another) the angle with which the cam looks increases which accommodates more people into the frame at the same distance which normal range would not.SPEAKERS: These are top notch.Whichever video it is, It just provides crystal clear audio.I beleive it's Dolby although it wasn't mentioned anywhere.GAMING: Although I game a lot on consoles and Pc's, I dont usually play games on mobiles.This mobile is good for mid range gaming though not for high end, and it never heated up(At-least for me).	5
16115	Moto g 6 phone very good but problem is back cover material is glass .first day i dropped my phone from my pocket and the back glass cover broke. and it very costly in your kalyan service center it's cost 3100 Ruppes. I am very surprised.	5
16116	Worst camera quality, not worth for money, screen touch is not good.	1
16117	1. BUILD QUALITY - Its PINK/MAGENTA! DON'T EXPECT A DEEP RED SHOWN AS THE PIC. XIAOMI should stop misleading its customers. Otherwise the build is nice. Still use a skin to protect it from Scratched. It is Slippery, so slap on a case. The GG5 works. No scratches on the screen till now (fingers crossed)THE CAMERA BUMP IS HUGEEEE!! Get a Armour case because you will need to save that camera.2. SOFTWARE - Android One is a breeze. Its smooth, although the optimization is not that good. Ive been facing almost daily problems with the Smart Locks and Bluetooth Levels, other wise its smooth. The Cameras are INCREDIBLE!! Good Dynamic Range, contrast levels are nice. The Video stabilization is also good.3. Others - Lack of a memory Card slot, a Headphone jack, an average Battery is okay for me as ive been using wireless Earphones for quite sometime. The Equipped Charger charged upto 100% in 1hr 10 mins. The speakers are loud. No issues there.Overall an okay device. Order only if the camera and Stock Android are of utmost importance. And if you get it on a discounted price. For 17k its not worth it.	4
16118	i didn't like camera quality	4
16119	It's a decent phone with gesture navigation and sleek looks. An average user (who doesn't game) should be able to juice out over a day's worth of charge from a full battery.Just know that it's a terrible gaming phone . Rest of the pros and cons are as follows.ProsLooks24 MP Selfie camera (has distortion issues)Miui battery optimizationSmall notchManual mode on the back camera with long exposureConsPrimitive face idterrible gaming performanceJust an average camera with poor HDROutdated chipsetTouch id fails if finger is sweatySelfie camera has massive distortion issues. You'll need third party apps to get good flat selfies.The display s curve is such that glass screen protectors will always have the corners poorly coveredTerrible speakersFull display	3

16159	Good phone must buy display quality is very impressive there is heating issue but not a big issue phone get heated from sides due aluminum. And rather than phone is very good should buy at this price.	4
16160	Bettery life is good or picture quality good	5
16161	I got this for 13500 with hdfc bank offer... Its worth the money.. Battery life is too good and other things satisfied me a lot.. Previously i was using honor 8 pro lasted for 2 years and still fine	5
16162	Looks, performance superb	5
16163	Display port qualities	1
16164	Auto brightness has some problems	2
16165	Nice product my wife is happy	4
16166	I purchased this product with closed eyes as it was by Xiaomi. I had good trust on Xiaomi, but this phone is not so oood. The top area of notch is not well caliberated. If you just touch that area, notification panel keeps popping up. For this price point, the Chipset provided is also older one. If some app has button in notch area, it is very difficult to access that.Big thanks to Amazon Custer Service for identifying technical issues and helping with return.5 STARS to Amazon.	3
16167	PROS....Compact design for single hand..Great battery backup.FHD + Display bright and clear.Front and rear camera works well..We'll developed privacy modesCONS.....No battery percentage notification.edge detection not so good in rear camera	5
16168	Rear Camera quality not good.... Bad rear camera quality.	3
16169	I recommend not to buy this product when watching video from YouTube the video resolution is very small you can even fit from screen to screen and what i really hate is that when you want to use internet with other sim like for eg ,jio and vodafone .if you switch to voda then jio will turn off.other phone if dont support both 4g but they give option to use which one may be 3g or 4g not just like this one software is also lagging time after it damage the memory card when you choose the options to move the data to memory card then then the memory card option disappear automatically.	1
16170	Outstanding performance of this Smartphone, 6.5 full view display and Camera quality is best. And bettey performance too long. Overall on this price it's outstanding.	5
16171	Did not get a headset	4
16172	One of the best looking phone... Brilliant display, decent hardware, fast finger print sensor, very ergonomic and excellent camera.Everyone who has seen the phone loved it, I purchased this for my wife and she loves it. I use MI MIX2 which itself is a beautiful phone, but this is ergonomically better and light. Go for it you wont regret.	5
16173	Owsm mobile looking sexy.....	5
16174	Proximity sensor is not working properly.	1
16175	Worst Product. Bad front camera. Please help me to return and refund.	1

16178	Superb Machine !!!Apple ke sare feature hai.....In 10K....Sad apple	5
16179	4000mA batt is really good choice. Its a gud phone with sar of 0.964 and 0.65 for head and body. SAR is less than Y2 and it has Full HD display. Some loved feature that i personally like was face unlock, double tap to open, 3 fingers screenshot n long screen shot. Overall mi is good. Certain features like mi cloud,video, music, drop, are not used by me. But they cud not be removed as well consuming memory. Mi remote is good, mi store n mi apps also useful. Overall a wonderful phone design and user interface from the mi team is so brilliant.	5
16180	By Exchanging old phone, I got a good Price.Phone will get heat while using in 2g speed internet. In 3G its good. Display is excellent.Mobile will get heated while palying games.Compare to price range, its little bit higher these features. Who want to use Made in India / Assembled in India. This a good product.I got satisfied which the Mobile exchange option.	4
16181	phone is very good. though I haven't used all the features but whatever I used is really good. You might came across bad review for battery life it is because of usage, you can turn off all the notifications, extra unwanted sound and you can save your time and battery of phone. one thing which need improvement is sound of speakers. All the best for your choice !!!!	5
16182	All is awsm	5

16187	pur qwality	1
16188	If they had included a fast charger it would be a great dealOtherwise it's 💯%	5
16189	The build quality is great. Feels like a premium mobile. Audio quality is not so good. Honor 6X has better sound quality when compared to 8X.Hope we might get Android updates.	4
16190	Best in medium price	5
16191	Though it has a commendable battery life of up to 2 days, there are annoying advertisements here and there - from the file manager to menu icons. Xiaomi should stop doing this as it is really annoying. The rear camera quality is average and the front camera quality is poor. Another point of caution is that you can use 4G only in one of the sim slots. I use Airtel for internet (4G) and Jio for calling and unable to use Jio for calls as Jio network is 4G only and have to manually switch.	4
16192	I bought this phone around 3 weeks back, I heavily played PUBG without using any network. Battery life is better than Xiaomi's 4000mah, but still didn't meet my expectation. If I play PUBG with my own 4G Volte network, then battery could drain even more faster. Graphics is good in this phone, no complaint about it till now. Screen is good with more vibrant colours and good screen to body aspect ratio.Camera performance with good lighting condition do not stands out of crowd, but night camera is really good.Selfie is mediocre with less amount of details, media consumptions in this device is a pleasure for those who always want to surf YouTube video contents.Overall build quality is attractive enough to grab everyone's attention.If your more into gaming and consume lot of video content, then this might be a good option. If your priority is more towards camera, then please don't go for it.There of lot of options available in the market for the same price tag.I hope this review might of cleared all your doubts, thank u	4
16193	May be redmi could have given camera quality at par with its other models...its too ordinary	4

16232	"** People who complain about heating and Battery drain, please update the software before use**One of the best in this price.For everyone who feels, this is made in China, Plz make a note it's ""Made in India"" though LG is a Korean manufacturer. Also most of the Xiaomi mobiles these days are made in India (i.e. Assembled in India)LG Q6 at its best for mid range.1. Great Display2. Not Chinese product3. Dual Sim with dedicated SD card slot4. Camera is good with adequate change in settings.5. Gorilla Glass enabled with Aluminium 7000 series Military grade frame (6 months screen replacement warranty)6. Latest Android OS 7.1.17. Screen-to-body ratio 78% which is the best of its kind.8. Bezel less display.Etc....I don't think no other mobile in this budget is available with these great specifications. As always LG (Life's Good) is with TECHNOLOGY NEXT-- To free up some RAM try disabling MLT/LDBDial *#546368#*700# - SVC Menu - LDB - Uncheck ""Enable"" - Restart"	5

16366	Amidst this horde of identicals LG has brought the Q6 to India, which I believe is amongst the best looking budget smartphone of all time. It carries the same Full Vision display we enjoyed on the LG G6, that made it a conversation starter every time I took the phone out of my pocket. However, as they say, “looks aren't everything”. To find out more about the phone, I dug deeper and here is what I found.Display and Design:First and foremost I must address the display on this device. I believe most of you would agree with me that the LG Q6 is a looker. Kudos to LG for bringing their flagship tech to the budget segment, reaching a wider audience range than flagships do. As you must have heard, LG calls this a Full Vision display. Essentially, the display is a little taller than the standard 1080p resolution. It rocks a 2160 x 1080p resolution, which takes the aspect ratio from the standard 16:9 to 18:9.Build qualityWhile the display makes the phone enticing, it also adds a sense of fragility. LG claims that its H-beam chassis is more than capable of handling those occasional bumps and drops. The frame itself is made out of 7000 series aluminium, which marketing jargon will tell you is an aerospace grade material. Although, to put it relatively, that has been used in smartphones for ages.Claims aside, I have been using the phone for a few days now and it does feel quite sturdy in hand. The edges are metallic and rounded, which makes the phone easier to grip. While Gorilla Glass 3 protects the display from scratches, the plastic back gets scratched quite easily. The Gorilla Glass 3 display is also flat and not curved. LG says that it has done so to “reduce annoying accidental touches”, you get in a phone with a curved display. However, I don't agree with that argument.UI and features:LG hasn't changed its UI significantly in terms of design and functionality since the LG G6. So, you still get a very colourful interface with no app drawer. LG tries to ease the user into the UI from the very beginning, with tutorials and pop-cards for almost all aspects and functions of the device. It will give you pop-ups to explain what you should do if your phone becomes unresponsive by chance or how you can add a fourth shortcut in the navigation panel at the bottom.Battery lifeThe LG Q6 brings a 3000mAh battery to the table, which is good enough for normal users. Using the phone as a daily driver I found that its battery is highly efficient and maintains its battery life quite well, even if you indulge in watching YouTube videos a lot. There is even a “game battery saver” mode, which adjusts the battery consumption and extend battery life. Although, that is something you won't need, as you can’t really game on the phone. The device scored 5 hours and 1 minutes on the PCMark benchmark, which isn't exceptional, but still workable, as the phone lasts a day easily even if you’re a heavy user.CameraLike the battery life, the rear 13MP camera on the LG Q6 is also just about good enough. Images taken in all lighting conditions look rather subdued, but have ample details and sharpness. Images do tend to be grainy, as you move to low light settings, but most images do look usable. I believe the camera could have achieved more with a manual mode, but LG has kept the camera app very lackluster. Apart from panorama and food mode, the phone doesn't really let you tweak settings further.Pros:Good lookingWell builtnice designCons:Performance is sub-parNo fingerprint scannerMy Opinion:The LG Q6 is a phone with the Redmi 4’s hardware inside the LG G6’s body. It’s meant for those who put more stock in design than internal hardware specs.	4

This is the worst phone i ever used in my life,*Battery last 3hr if used continuously or will last in 8hr.*Camera is same which is used by Indian government to take photo for Voter ID or Adhar card. (You know what I mean)*Heating Issue(good for winter no need for heater)*Face recognition which some time work some time does not. ultimately you will be using pattern lock or pin.*Cant play any high end game your hand will start burring if you tired, also keep a charger with you as better will be drained very soon.*Hot spot some time work some time notIf you can bear the above said complement then you can go for it. There is only one advantagesIt will give you Best display after AMOLED with 18:9 Ratio	1
16375	"Hi there this smartphone is very good and cool under rs 14000 and also it has a full vision display on it which is trending in the current smartphone world. It has Face unlock feature also. It has aspect ratio of 18:9 which is very good under the budget range. It has many features in it which are given below and also i am distributing this review between pros and cons so that you can decide whether you can purchase it or not.Features and Details:-=>View without BoundsA phone with smaller bezels resulting in a 18:9 Wide full screen display fits comfortably in your hands, Stunning, Seamless Design with US military standard-810G certification for durability designed to better endure impact from any direction.

It is priced at budget range by the premium company LG.5. It has 3GB ram and 32GB internal storage under this Price range.CONS:-1. the only con is that it does not have a fingerprint sensor on it which is very fashionable in now a times so if you want a fingerprint sensor on your smartphone you should not go for this.So this is my review for this LG Q6 vision hope this review helped you in purchasing this smartphone and if it helped then please vote it helpful."	4

Phone looks like a premium.Only one thing I face a problem when I watch you tube and capturing pics, both,vedio does not come on full screen and camera does not show full screen.  Overall phone and it's performance best in this range.  So I suggess ,u can go with this.	5
16426	Pros: A perfect Android One phone with the promise of great cameras and decent performance for best price of Rupees 16,999. Cons : Battery is draining little fast. Means it's lost for 8 - 10hrs max if internet is on when mobile is fully charged.	5

16438	Front camera is fake. When I use moto camera it Shows 16 megapixel but when i use 3rd party camera apps it's shows actual camera resolution. Rear camera is not too much good due to small sensor size camera detail & quality is not so good and edge detection is worst,focusing is slow.	1

16553	Great fit in this price but mi phones comes with a lot of their inbuilt apps that take too much space. Camera quality , face lock are great. I still miss my old ui from moto g3 but eventually i will get habitual of this one too.	5
16554	It was not only a excellent phone .But first I thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery.	5

16557	The built quality, Touch sensitivity, display and cellular network quality are good,  but the speaker is not loud enough, indoor camera clarity is bad, bit slippery, no curved glass display, no fast charging and the worst part is very low battery backup.	3
16558	Nice camera but it can't support some times and mobile hang very quickly	4
16559	I can only say overpriced..there is no notification led..or snapshot feature. The only reason I chose this is because it supports dual sim+dedicated memory slot..This should be ideally priced in the range 12-15k..If you are okay with hybrid slot, then go for other brands	3
16560	Very Good Phone in this price range.	5
16561	I am a big fan of MI phones... I was waiting for this MI A2 release for a long time, got it in first sale, but the phone is not upto the my expectation level. First time I am regretting to buy a Xiaomi phone.Here are my review after using it for a month:1. Good Camera: you will get superb quality pics by this phone,  however low light pics are not of that good quality, blur pics in low light.2. Nice UI, Android one is suerb3. Light weightCons:1. The biggest issue with this phone is the POOR battery, I have to charge it twice in a day for normal uses. this is very pathetic, however the charging is fast but then the drawback is you have to carry the charger everywhere as it supports c-type charging.2. very few pre installed apps. you have to install each and everything by your own. missing default Gallery app, you have to download it from playstore.3. struggling with contacts, not able to find how to disable to stop showing e-mail id in contacts, earlier there was an option not to display incomplete numbers in contact this time it is missing may be because of Android one, but I found an alternate way of doing this installed a contacts app from play store and using it.	2
16562	Value for money. Camera is better than the Mi A1 I used earlier. Night photos and low light photos are also impressive. Battery life is more than 7 to 8 hours even on high usage. Sound level is very high.  Even on 50 % volume sound output is very good. Very light weight and fast. Must buy..	5
16563	Kooool phone	5
16564	Everything is awesome except battery life.	5
16565	Vey nice mobile compAre to other chinese phones. Its display is big and perfect for watching movies. Battery,charging,camera all are fine	5

16583	Well in this time where everything is dependent on internet this phone is not downloading things at the speed which it should. This phone sucks don't buy it. See the network speed 👆 in the photo, literally it sometimes goes to 20k/s, apps like Jio doesn't fit into its screen.. And when u try to download anything it's speed is less than even a tortoise.i have screwed up my money..Huawei people if u r watching this review kindly don't come up with these kind of mobiles other than it looks.. Everything is disappointing.Reviewing after 4 months of use.	1

16590	Writing this review after 1 month of usage.What a powerful device. And by power I mean internally and externally too. It's a tank. I was wanting to buy a smartphone since an year or so but when these redmi phones were setting the mobile market on fire, I was never a big fan of their interface and those devices as a whole. I was always a big fan of Motorola phones as my previous device was Moto x play. But o never blindly follow any brand and those g series phones weren't offering good batte...READ MORE	4

16606	The design of this phone is very attractive it feels like premium phone in hand .camera is good ....If battery would have been 3400 or 3500 mah then it would had been really great but overall its good phone..	4

16611	Hey guys this is TECHBORED! and here are the top 5 features of MiA2 that I loved and I will also include the rating that I will be giving to each aspect of this Smartphone.DESIGN- 9/10. There is a camera hump that is why I gave 9.CAMERA- 10/10. The best camera at this price.PROCESSING- 10/10. The best class processor at this price.BATTERY- 8/10. Just 3000 mAh battery instead of giving 4000 mAh battery.SOFTWARE- 10/10. Fully stock android.HARDWARE- 8/10. It is because there is no 3.5mm Headphone jack.-----------------------------------------------------BELOW ARE THE TOP 5 FEATURES OF Mi A2:-----------------------------------------------------1. DESIGN- It comes with a fully metallic design and also the beautiful Full HD display with Gorilla Glass Protection. It has the fingerprint sensor on the back.2. CAMERA: It comes with those 20MP+12MP primary dual camera and 20MP front facing camera. These cameras takes beautiful pictures with the combination of AI. the best thing about it is that there is a single camera on the front but still that camera takes portrait shots.3. PROCESSOR: It is powered with Snapdragon 660 and it has also the AI engine. The multitasking is great and you can play high end games flawlessly.4. SOFTWARE: It is a smartphone that comes with Android 1 support which means that it will get android updates in time and it runs on fully stock android. It just now runs on latest Android Oreo 8.1.5. PRICE: This is main and very exciting thing about this smartphone. At this price this smartphone has great features and I think this is very less price for this Smartphone and everybody should take a look at this device in this price range.	5

16615	Phone not at all comparable with mi note 4 or mi a1. Looks are good but battery is worst, 12 hours hardly backup on minimum usage. Face detection does not work 90% of the time. Do not buy this phone if you are reading this review.	2
16616	Pie nine theme make look too bad.	1
16617	Even though having 432 ppi pixel density, it lacks sharpness while watching TV. Also battery drains a little more than expected. Resmi note 5 pro is far superior to Redmi 6 pro.Not very happy.	3

16642	Works well	5
16643	Veek nes product	1
16644	Before going to buy any product on Amazon every one should think twice due to Amazon's senseless policy. If you buy any product you can't assume the product quality, Right? I bought Moto G6 phone and I want to return that product because the body panel is not up to the mark. It is very delicate. Even camera is also not that much good. But when I tried to return this product they would not allow me. I asked them one question i.e., without seeing the product, how can I assume that is good or bad? But they don't have answer for that question. Because of them I using this mobile against my will.	1
16645	Phone is ok but not as good as MI NOTE 5 PRO	5
16646	Good looking.	5
16647	Far better than bloody chinese companies mobile phones. Camera very near to natural colors .It does not shows any artificial colors ,no over brightness like mi and honor.Display is crispy no blue rays like chinese mi and honor mobile phones .Despite of the fact that this phone has less features but it's quality is very high.One who wants a phone with more features and low quality can buy Mi and Honor , Others who want high quality can buy LG q6.The phone is quite elegant .	5
16648	The screen width could be a bit bigger,overall performance is great,canera,ram ,processor,sound is good	5
16649	As always LG gives its best. Great phone with excellent features for the given price. Durability is something LG is good at.	5

16661	Osam product battery life is Muh Muh ...😘	5
16662	Overall good performance, only slightly heat when charging. Charging required everyday if internet is used for whole day.	4
16663	Pros: I really love the phone because of its display size and the build quality. I have the blue variant which looks very premium.  Battery would easily last for 2 days on average use. Performance on par with SD636 and 660. Nice set of cameras, but still needs to improve.Cons: Poor volume levels in music playback(very low volume). Stutters during game play especially PUBG.	4

16679	Except for the 18:9 display, it's just a plain vanilla phone....Xiaomi  phones are better at half the price.	3
16680	Redmi 6 Pro mobile is best among other mobiles in terms of price, quality as well as features provided in it.	5
16681	More than average	5
16682	Samsung J8 is a overall good Product. Camera Quality is good with lots of function& features in both front and rear. Missing notification light in this product. If Compare with redmi note 4 (4GB) variant, it is slightly slow in open a app, calling. Lookwise it is a  great and touch is very smooth. fingerprint works good (if you proper registerd it) face recognition is good but i disabled that function. So many samsung pre-installed app, few of them is useless.	5

16698	The phone is just fantastic.Ordered on the launch day midnight and received on the next day. Kudos to amazon for fast delivery.PROS:(1) DISPLAY: The display is very vibrant and of good quality. The display size is big but for eyes not for your hands or pockets. 10/10(2) DESIGN: We all know about this so no comment.10/10(3) CAMERA: The pics are very sharp and close to reality. Night mode is awesome. 9/10(4) BATTERY: The battery is powerful and it will be more powerful if used with AIRTEL sim. I have watched 2 movies on  YouTube and still 68% juice left. Taken about 117 minutes to charge from 10 to 100%(5) NO LAGS: I don't feel any type of lags while using it. Gaming persons can tell about this.(6) SECURITY: Face unlock and fingerprint scanner works like a charm. No need to press power button for face unlock.CONS:STILL FINDINGEXPECTATIONS FROM HONOR:(1) Please provide EIS in the updates so that camera will work with its full capacity.(2) If possible please provide fast charging.	5

16711	Best For Entertainment not for camera .	3
16712	It is a very good phone I was little bit confused which to buy wait for asus zenfone max pro m2 or honor 8x. But when i saw detailed reviews of honor 8x i immediately purchased this mobile.Their r few reasons to buy honor 8x for me1. 12nm processor (2.2Ghz)2. Battery efficiency (AI)3. Glass body and unique design with metal frames.4. Chin is very small compaired to other 📱 in this range(because of on chip display technology)5. Camera is very good both(front and back).(AI camera)6. Gaming is awesome (PUBG supports GPU Tarbo) mindblowing graphics.And also thanks to amazon.1. Good delivery 🚚2. Secure package.Thank u honor and thank u amazon team.Friends go for it without any doubts. Far better than Asus Max Pro M2.	5

16736	thr display is very good the camera is nice everthings perfect its a good mobile.	4
16737	I have read many negative reviews about this phone but honestly , I have found very less negative things till now.Here I will not mention any pros or cons , here I will share my views regarding all the mentioned cons.Many people are complaining about its heating issue.Yes, also I have faced it but that's not an unbearable issue and it's a temporary issue, I faced it rarely and it will be solved after the first or second update of software. The heating issue has been found in phone's left side , near the volume key. As this part of the phone  is made of metal and battery is placed near the volume key so, this heating issue is felt but  it can't be mentioned as heating because temperature of other parts of the phone remains normal and there is nothing serious to worry about.  One suggestion to all the users of this model : Please,  don't use your phone while it's charging and do charge your phone  before it drains phone's battery completely. It will increase your battery's life , it will save your battery back up efficiently and  the heating issue can be avoided.Many people are saying that battery is draining so quickly , I didn't face any issue regarding the battery. Actually, you can't compare it with a phone which has a huge 4100 mah or 5000 mah battery back up.  If you do so , you will get many flaws. ;)  This phone is not recommended for a heavy gamer. If you are a mixed user of different applications , then definitely this phone will be for you.It didn't have any finger print scanner and I believe that in this price range a fingerprint scanner should be made available but that can't be a negative point. It has a double knock screen unlock  facility.  If phone's face unlock facility doesn't work in the low light, it (double knock) will definitely work ;) Camera's aperture should be 2.0 instead of 2.2. Anyways, camera's quality is quite decent  though it suffers a lot in the low light but overall it's a decent camera.Back side of this phone is made of a glossy plastic which is easily searchable. Back side of this phone should be made of either scratch free plastic or metal. I agree that it's definitely a negative thing.I am using this phone now and in the beginning I became upset after reading all the negative reviews but after using it for 3 weeks , I am now fully satisfied though I believe that price should within 11000 but as it's linked with LG . So, if anyone is concerned about the brand then this price will not be a headache.Thank You. :)	5
16738	Performance with out any hitch	5

16744	Worst phone by mi dont buy	1
16745	I purchased it and I am satisfied with its price to value ratio. Front Camera performance is not good in low light. But in proper light, pictures are fantastic.Battery performance is superb. Both SIM have LTE support. But only once at a time. Screen quality is good. But viewing angle could have been better. Build quality is sturdy and superb.Overall performance if this device is satisfactory. Recommended for all those who wants to buy a relatively smaller and perfect sized mobile. Not recommend for SELFIE lovers.	5

16751	First of all this is the best mobile that I ever had....At this price range this mobile is good to purchase...I have used it for more than 2 weeks and here are some things that I observed...Pros:1. Battery life is amazing for heavy gaming,calling,chating etc., It lasts for a day.2. Both cameras are working in amazing condition....the picture quality is more nicer than expected...too good.3. Notch is placed good and mobile feels quite nice in hand...4. Gestures provided are supremely super...5. Decent ram management and no lag...6. Gaming is super and no lag while playing games like asphalt 9, pubg, etc.,Cons:1. Front camera is not super in night time...it's good but not super...2. Face recognition shall get faster....it's good now but in low light it recognises somewhat 2-3 seconds late...but in day light it opens in a flash...it shall improve in low light...That's it overall the mobile is stunning in colour and processing wise...	5

16766	Good phone at a decent price with good front and back camera. I have been using this phone for 5 days and have found that the phone runs smoothly. The fingerprint sensor and face detection unlocking are pretty responsive and colours on screen are quiet vivid. Only problem is with MI Video player. The videos play very badly (both picture and sound) in this player and there is no option to directly open videos on other players directly. Rest all is good. A very good phone in this price range	4

16855	Yet to start using but feeling good in hands	5
16856	Very bad heating too much	1
16857	K	5
16858	Review after using for one month. In this price range, you can rely on Honor 8X as it delivers the best performance till now. As well as the camera quality is also good especially in AI mode. Battery backup is also very good as one full charge will last 3 days with normal use(till 0%), with gaming still you can make it to 2 days battery power. Performance wise you can play high-end games (PUBG, MORTAL KOMBAT X, INJUSTICE 2, ASPHALT 9 etc) without any lagging. No heat issue as of now.	5
16859	overall the phone is good but there are few drawbacks:*UI is not that smooth*battery capacity and efficiency is not at power with the device*the front glass quality is really very poor*the primary camera performance is averageapart from this that phone feels really premium and you will not regret buying it	4
16860	The front camera is good but the real camera has high saturation.	5
16861	Phone came with 0% battery life and bulge in screen.!!!	1
16862	excellent product within the prize	5
16863	Not recommended to buy.	2

16887	I just like whole phone... No disliking found.	5
16888	"Pros:1. Display: It is the best display that I've ever seen in a phone. The aspect ratio and the bezel less design looks great to the addition of 2k pixels.2. Camera: Camera performance is quite good. Its not something extraordinary but its better than the benchmarks at this price.3. Battery backup is quite good.4. Even though it is underpowered in paper, in day to day use it doesn't feel laggy.5. Very premium build quality.6. Face unlock is ""okay""Cons:1. Back panel attracts lots of fingerprints and scratches.2. Even the screen is prone to scratches without protection.3. No fingerprint sensor.Therefore it is quite a decent phone for its price range with the best screen."	5
16889	Design is very bad	1
16890	what else you want in 12999 price?The main feature of this phone is DISPLAY. If you are looking for good display phone this is the best option.Battery life is good for day to day use. Average phone use will consume 60% battery in day time.Both Camera are average.If you are not heavy user this is the best one. Looks of the phone are awesome.	5

16920	I received this product yesterday. At first, the phone looks awesome. However,  after opening the packet and starting the phone, I found that the phone is a Heater!!It become very hot even surfing internet, watching an online video or making/taking calls. Sometimes, it becomes so hot that you cannot even hold it. Amazon lied to me and sold A handheld heater and they won't take it back either. I am looking forward to selling it on OLX. It appears that I am at a huge loss here!! Stay away from LG. This is my second LG smart phone and both were waste of money!!	1

16929	For any Indian SIM if enable with international roaming , it would work in any phone either US or Indian . But this Nokia model doesnt work or pair with any telecom provider of US.	3
16930	First of all this phone is for the one who want to use a good phone and not a psp gamer.I've always been a high end mobile hardware freek with an inclination to good aesthetics & pocket ability of cellular phones.Let me tell u as a phone & media device, it's a perfect device withGreat screen,Perfect size,Durable beautiful built with aluminium frame (the back cover is the not the best though).Trust me even though one negative which is SD 435 is not an issue  as the  phone  behaves perfect  with multitasking and in any of the applications & video play or net browsing.Battery gives a full 24hrs of moderate usage with wifi always on + screen on time of 7hrs with 40-50%brightness +web browsing 5hrs+ call time of 3hrs+whatsapp/fb 2-3hrs.Dual Sim slot + dedicated sd card slot.Only Cons isSlow only in high intense graphic games.The back cover could have been metal.Go ahead & get the phone  if u are not  a high end gamer.	4
16931	Nice mobile to use.Front camera is not good	4
16932	Thank you Amazon for great phone	4
16933	Excellent mobile with good features.	4
16934	Good camera and fratures..good exchange offer from amazone..	5
16935	Quick candid reviewAn amazing feel holding the Q6. Handy!!!Go for platinum Color if you need to stand out in crowd. Premium looksA tougher bodyOutstanding display. High resolutionComfortable UIProcessor fast, 3 GB ram, but slower for heavy gamingScreen size effective and comfy.Battery alright. Nothing to rave about.Price reasonable. I got for 14k.Camera rear good, front below averageToo many selfie modes.No finger print. Face recognition is quick and effective.Gorilla glass. A good move.Dedicated SD card slot. No storage issues.Light weight 150gmsSlight heating during chargingWater resistant. Heat resistant.Sounds okay. Video terrific.Headphones basic.Slow charger. Need to replace it with fast one.Not many pre-installed apps. Good thought.No led notifications.Screen buttons only. But the back button or trash button can be moved as per your convenience. This option is given only in LG phones. If you are left handed you can change placement of buttons accordingly.Now you can compare Q6 with Micromax canvas Infinity though expensive LG wins hands down. The difference is built quality, screen resolution, and body. The only good thing with Micromax Infinity is the fingerprint scanner.These all qualities that Q6 are almost same as Samsung S7, S8. The Samsung phones are super amoled, rest the feel is almost same.Verdict - if you have a budget of between 10 to 15k and you want infinity display unlike standard screen ratio phones, This is a highly recommended Android phone.	4
16936	Battery 🔋 is good 👍😎Picture poor sound 🔊 OK	5
16937	Battery is excellent but camera and sound should be improved in next update	4
16938	very nice phone, looking like premium phone. camera is excellent both,actually  I'm using mi a1, but nokia 6.1 plus is beaten in all aspects.and vvvvvvvvvvvery very much happy about delivery by flipkartREAD MORE	4

16944	Quit good.	4
16945	baut hi Acha phone h picture quality badiya h or battery backup baut Acha h.	5
16946	Everything is Perfectly ok but one thing which i was not getting properly is the mobile display size & its ratio is not very well clear....Please discribe this properly....i was thinking that the mobile is larger in size but its only the display size which is almost equivalent to the mobile size.....Little smaller in size than expected....	4
16947	I am in love with this beautiful mobile... Best in its class in all perspectives....1. Display : big, crispy, clear display as it have Full HD +.. Nice colour reproduction with least radiation from display... Eye friendly..2.  Processor : A powerful kirin 710 having amazing performance.. PLAYING  PUBG since 30th October and never noticed lag or heating ... I think this is enough to tell about performance3. Camera : Both rear and front cameras quality are mind blowing... If you have basic knowledges of photography then from Pro mode you can get professional photos from this mobile... AI photography doing great job.. I just clicked random photos attached with this review... Super slow motion is biggest pros of cameras it just amazing....4. Look and design : it looks premium and excellent build quality having glass coating finish with dual tone colour pattern which makes it most beautiful mobile in market till now...5. Battery : because of ram management and tweaks with Emui battery gives more then one day back up on average uses... On moderate use it will last entire day... So no problem with thisVerdict : if you are going to buy a mobile around 15k then it's the mobile you can believe for great look, performance and reliability... Go ahead and grab one... I also ordered my 2nd mobile.....	5
16948	suberb performance shown by the phone...I love the design...plus the camera is just phenomenal🤩READ MORE	5
16949	3rd class	1
16950	Good product and recommend to all buyers	5
16951	front camera is like VGA and back camera 2MP. Phone display is good. Amazon is not even taking return items unless you follow frustrating process.	1
16952	Phone sound quality and pictures quality is very nice but phone cm is small but screen is much better	5
16953	Good product but I received a damaged product	4
16954	Mobile superb	4
16955	Super stylish and durable.....	5
16956	Sound Quality is awesome and material is quiet good	5
16957	Amazing phone. Buy without a second thought. Looks very premium in hand but very delicate to use as back side is made of glass and it has a big screen. Those people who use phone roughly should not buy this. If u can carry this phone with proper care it is the best phone within 15 k. Battery 🔋 is superb. Display is amazing. User interface is very good. Does the work very fast what is given to it. Thank u to Kirin 710 processor. Picture quality is very good, but the people who like natural pictures will dislike the pictures taken by it. It produces already edited pictures, there comes no necessity to editing after capturing. As far as the con is concerned I can tell that it has not fast charging and special attention should be given during handling of this phone. The sound output is a little bit less compared to other rivals of this range. Above all a good package.	5
16958	Gud budget friendly.	4
16959	the best value for money if you are looking for Android One OS. this is as good as you can get with stock Android. i bought Mi A1 for my father a year ago and it is still going very strong and hence with the trust i bought Mi A2. happy so far...	5
16960	Phone looks good with metal sides and rounded display smart phone under 15K. That to fullvision display	5
16961	Good. Camera lovers don’t go with it.	4
16962	It is comfort for the new needs	5
16963	Front and back camera not good	1
16964	This series of mi is famous for camera and it really a beast in camera phones  in under this range.	5
16965	Charger becomes to hot during charge. During slow motion video mode object showing blurred. Front and back camera are average not as per given specification Over all performance is good. Amazon delivers mobile phone in within 24hrs	4
16966	This is the most beautiful and elegant mobile phone you could get in this price range. Display is superb. I got this phone for 10k after exchange offer and sbi debit card benefit.Pros-1-elegant display with vivid colours.2-Superb build quality so mobile feels good in hand unlike moto g5 plus.3-Battery backup is good, not as good as some other chineese phones but It can easily last a whole day with average use.4-Rear camera is decent. Not as good as moto g5 plus but better than any other chineese brands. Only con with rear camera is that it does not have Duel tone Led flash so photos taken with flash have bit yellowish tint which kills the purpose of the flash.5-Lg's UI is good. I thought tht lg's Ui would be a disaster but after using this phone for 15 days I can say that Ui is clean and minimal with fluid response. Some customization provided by LG are also commendable and you will fall in love with it.6-Audio response from 3.5 mm  headphone jack is fine.7-You will feel that face unlocking feature is a gimmick but I suggest that you should use improve face unlocking with providing more face images with different lighting conditions so that this feature can be used in all type of lighting condition. Though Face unlocking does not work in low light condition.8-Wide angle feature in front and rear camera is a good feature.Cons-1- It feels premium to hold but back cover of this phone is made of plastic. This plastic back cover is very prone to scratches. I used this phone for 15 days with careful handling but it got scratched a lot and now it looks ugly with those scratches so i put a back cover on it to hide those scratches. I don't like to put cover case on my phone but with this phone I have to use a cover. This is the biggest con for me.2- The front facing camera is very poor even in good lighting condition. Rear camera is just above average. If you want a good camera phone then buy moto g5 plus.3- This phone is not for heavy gamers so stay away from it if you play heavy games. It can play heavy games on medium setting but battery drains very fast while playing games and device gets heat up. So if you only play games on mobile then buy any chineese phone like note 4. I don't play games on mobile so It serves my purpose well. Multitasking is good on this phone so an average user won't have any complain in performance department.4- It does not have LED notification light but we can live without it. It has all essential sensors like gyroscope except fingerprint sensor.5- It does not have fast charging.6- I tried my best but haven't found any tempered glass for this phone yet. I bought 3-4 tempered glass from amazon and ebay but all leave bubbles after applying. I could not find suitable tempered glass in local stores also because local stores are not interested in LG mobiles. They only have products for masses who buy xiomi,vivo,oppo,lenovo etc phones. I am a rough user so after using this phone without any tempered glass I found out that the screen got scratched a bit. So I am not sure tht this phone has gorilla protection or not.  So in conclusion I would say that LG mostly focused on 18:9 aspect ration screen with 442 ppi and put all resources into it so if you want to buy this phone then excellent display should be top in your priority else there are many good phones in the market. If you don't play heavy games on phone and can live with average battery life then don't look elsewhere and buy this phone. You would love the screen of this phone when you will read anything on it and consume media. 442 ppi screen is just crisp and mesmerizing to use. I guarantee you that you will not like using other phone's display in this price range after using lg q6. 18:9 aspect ratio with minimum bezels is the future indeed.And please suggest a good tempered glass for this phone if you find one or using it. I hope that Tempered glass makers come up with good tempered glass for this phone soon.	4

16976	The phone is quite good but let me tell you honestly this phone works smoothly but apart from this the phone heats up very much from the left alumunium side and after the  5 minutes of usage in volte or watching youtube channel or videos. looks wise the phone looks awesome, very light weight but the camera is average.processor is fast. the only usp of this mobile is full vision display . in my opnion you should you go for moto g5 plus or g5s plus.	3

16995	Within the first 2 days the usb cable stopped working. Then the ear phone stopped working. Face unlock does not work. SD card of UHS3 is shown very slow whereas the same works in Samsung S9 very fast. Moto light keeps flickering and mobile hangs. Had to delete all apps and reload. Camera very slow.  Cannot delete cached memory in inbuilt storage. Phone very slippery. Had to buy a case which I hate. What is the use of covering your phone if you can't show it off. Visited their customer care centre 6 times to sort out issues. I have never visited for my Mi5 earlier. Good thing battery holds till evening. And no bloat ware.	2

16998	If you looking for a great display phone within the budget segment then definitely go for it, I bought the phone yesterday and I am really happy with the full vision display. Only cons I found that I am not able to watch YouTube videos in fit to screen mode. Other phone specifications are as usual, not that great. But at the end of the day, the screen quality and phone speed matters for any smartphone for day to day usage.	5

Originally, I am a big Nokia fan and Nokia 6.1 plus was a very nice deal but I am a rough user who does not use a phone case or a tempered glass and Nokia with its glass back looked really nice but I had my doubts about its durability. Motorola on the other hand has a boring but a very durable and strong build. I did not go for Redmi Note 5 Pro because I am not a fan of its MIUI and moreover I am a bit orthodox regarding Brand value and I can...READ MORE	5

17066	Bought this phone as a surprise gift for my wife on her birthday last month and before the start of Great Indian Sale on Amazon. I believe I bought it in the 1st flash sale only on 2nd October. Amazon Pay EMI experience was smooth and delivery was quick as always. Posting this crisp review after a month use of Redmi 6 Pro (3 GB/32 GB).Pros:1) Brilliant full HD display2) Good build quality3) Great Network reception4) Seamless 4G connectivity on both SIMs5) Fast Snapdragon 626 Octacore processor6) Good RAM management (No Lags)7) Good primary camera (13+5 MP) with added features8) IR Blaster (Universal Remote)9) Greater Gaming Experience (PUBG & Asphalt 9 with no lags)10) MI UI 9.5 gives good overall user experience including a greater battery management.Cons:1) 5 MP Selfie Camera at a starting price point of 11 K is totally unjust.2) No wide angle lens on front cam3) Front cam sensor could have been better to counter RealMe 24) The 2 cam setup in primary camera fails to generate great pictures with depth (Bookeh) effect.5) Secondary 5 MP depth effect cam is not integrated well to generate greater depth effect (Expecting a camera software update soon for improved experience).6) Primary camera sometimes struggles to focus on non-human object while taking still pictures7) Single speaker could have been a bit better8) 5.84 inch FHD screen is good but a 6 inch screen could have been much betterOverall its a good phone considering the fact that its the very first phone from MI with a notch screen however it certainly lacks that one great punch in front camera department. At least a quick software update is must to enhance the overall quality of the images produced by its 5 MP selfie cam.	4
17067	overall good	5
17068	LG Q6 is unique design with its full face screen. the phone is handly and fits easily on your palm . Although the screen size is 5.5 inches its smaller and comfortable to hold as compared to all other phones of same size screen.battery backup is okay.Headphones are exceptionally good witg crystal clear sound quality.Face recognition works perfectly fine which is one feature i like the most.ram performance is fine for a regular use. there isnt any lagging in performance or heating issues. i havent done any gaming yet. but have tried using multiple apps parallaly and all works well.There are 2 slim slots one has a single nano sim while the other gotta single sim and for expandable memory card which is again a unique feature. not sure how it would be useful but i liked it .The cameras performance is something which i dont like. Definitely LG could do better on those grounds. The camera could have been much more better.  the only reason why i give 4 stars .Good luck guys you wont repent ur investment. This is worth it.but if u are looking for a good camera dont go for it.	4
17069	Value for money phone. However, the phone does not support two simultaneous 4G connections, one can be 4G while the other will have to be 3G. So can't use two Jio SIMs. When the world is moving to 5G, why offer only 1 4G connection on a new phone ? Am not sure if a software upgrade can enable us to use both SIMs with 4G simultaneously. Width could have been increased by another 1 cm similar to Note for a proper pocket fit. Length is ok. Charging cable is short and of mediocre quality. Plenty of storage, both for onboard and external memory. Decent performance for day to day needs. Anyway, it's a Chinese brand, so not much to talk about quality of hardware, software etc. Even though many other Japanese and American companies get their mobiles manufactured in China, the specs are controlled by the MNC company. So the quality of Iphone, Sony, are top notch and expensive. But for mass market consumption, Xiomi quality and price are accordingly matched.	4

17076	Product is very good.Only thing which is missing is dual volte support Redmi should now start rolling out the handset with chipset which can provide dual volte.But as for this product absolute beauty.	5
17077	The display and size camera video shooting mode are good but the weight is more	4
17078	Value for money, camera is awesome, smooth processer battery life is very impressive, touch powerful and face & fingerprint fast unlock. Excellent quality by Huawei	5
17079	Cons:1.You cannot delete multiple msgs at a time with in a conversation or even with in inbox.2.You don't have hide Apps future. you need to install 3rd party apps.3.you don't have kids space.4.sound quality is like coming from a Empty Drum.5.Front camera shows over brightness6.While typing if we are trying to touch space bar.. some time its touching the home button.. Not useful for fast typing.All these futures i have compared with my meizu m3 note, which i have purchased 2yrs back from Amazon flash sale.These are present in Meizu note 3,but not in Honor 8x.. which are much routinely needed futures in a mobile.	4

17100	Brilliant execution by the Huawei Engineering team. You guys truly know how to make great phones.I found NO problems with heat, battery life and camera and sound output.For those who experience battery problems, you need to install apps directly from the play store and not from a backup. This keeps everything clean.Excellent camera in both daylight and low light. Use the night mode in low light or enable the moving objects feature!! Selfie camera captures lots of light. Both the front and back cameras are very fast. AI mode does seem to increase staturation. In some environments, AI does improve the picture quality. Very easy to disable in scenes where its not required. AI is not enabled by default.Sound output on speaker is as good as any other phone. I found it as loud as my Samsung Note. As with any phone speaker, use a bluetooth speaker in noisy environments. To get an optimal headset experience, use the sound settings to choose the type of headphones connected.Now for the real pros.1) Eye comfort. This is excellent!! For people who use phones to read and to get work done, this feature is a must have!! Eye comfort gets rid of the blue light completely. My eyes didnt tire out as it does with other phones and laptops, specially after 11 at night.2) Excellent display. Super clarity. One look and you can feel the colors pop.3) Automatic brightness works amazingly well. Its very fast to detect changing light environments.4) Build quality and screen size - Huawei has put a lot of thought into this and it shows. Feels smooth, solid and premium!!5) Firefox, Chrome, Skype, Word, Excel, Camera etc etc instantly load from RAM. Excellent memory management.Looking forward to some great updates.	5

17136	It's not a fancy move or conspiracy among mobile manufacturers to get rid of the headphone jack. There are considerable improvements to sound quality through USB-C. You have to get a headphone with a built in DAC to experience the difference. There's no going back now.  The disadvantage here is that you won't be able to use a wired headphone while charging.  I use a KZ-ZSR with a USB-C cable with a built-in DAC also by KZ. Player is USB Audio Player Pro. Sounds light years ahead of an analog 3.5mm headphone.	5

17144	What worst can be a deal where you pay INR16,000+ for a branded phone whose speakers stop working with in a week and has hanging issues with a below average battery life and heating issues up to some extent.Looks are not everything, Nokia ppl should learn before failing again in market.Amazon please see if my new phone could be refunded. Bad experience overall.	1

17200	U feel like apple notch phone in your hand. Screen quality is very good. Camera is absolutely good.	3
17201	Camera quality is superb. Overall performance is very good.only problem is weaker battery.	4
17202	I just bought Redmi 6 Pro  few days back. So far experience is very good, UI experience, photo quality & battery life all are good. Except the volume of the speaker is low, having headset would become mandatory.	4
17203	best phone notch display but wide screen size small for me..	5
17204	The product is launched in September 2018 & doesn't have Dual 4g VOLTE support. That's strongly disappointing.. 2 years old Snapdragon 625 processor is there. Its not future proof. Otherwise it's  good phone.	2
17205	Great display...Touch is also Good...Work very well....	5
17206	It's a best phone  at this price	4
17207	It works preety well..Good display and picture quality.Long battery life and good charging speed.Love using.. This model.	5
17208	I like phone desgin and colour. But i noticed there is some heating issue.. and touch sensitiveness is less. If using oneplus phone after that you uses this phone you will unstisfied with phone. Not worh 20k .. it should be around 15k.	3

17218	Guys it just best smartphone this price	3
17219	Value for money, Awesome Design...👍	5
17220	Picture quality is very bad compared to its specification. Dslr effect is also very poor. Sound quality is normal. But tbe worst thing is, if dnt restart the mob in every few hours it's finger print sensor wnt work. The in build apps of samsung disturbs the device management rather helping it. Its only 3 month, i had to reformat d phone already,..severe problem with any file download, even if u try yo downld updates of app it wont allow it, even if deactivate data saving mode.	2
17221	Picture quality goodSound quality goodBattery life Very good	4
17222	Battery life is just one day, but gets fast charging, no headphone jack!! Should have one	4
17223	I just open this product. This product have no wrapper. Also box is buzzing whenever I'm shaking it. I buy this for giving gift to my relative. If there is no mobile otherwise i need claim. So I'm giving awareness about this. And also please sent to customer proper packing for satisfaction of the customerThank you	4
17224	Well where do I start from.  For 15k this is a great phone. I bought it for my dad. I am very satisfied with the phone. Honor have started making very nice n premium phone on low budget. I had also bought real me pro2 from flipkart for my sis. I compared both I must tell u go for honor 8x, real me pro2 doesn't have portrait mode or bokeh mode on front camera.. display is bigger then real me pro2, this is the only difference otherwise both phones are alike. If u ask me then I will prefer honor 8x	5
17225	Great picture quality.	4
17226	Excellent product by mi	5
17227	Picture quality is too good but white tone is over exposed.Sound quality very good.Battery life is normal bettter than other smartphone.	5
17228	Moto phones are very prone to heating. This phone continues the decorum. My previous phone was Moto G3, it was having the same problem.ElseBattery life is ok, camera is good, sound is so so....Final cut: better to buy some other brand with same budget. Like Redmi note 5 pro or 6 pro	3

17239	I got this mobile in 10K. Display is awesome. Other things are not upto the mark. And for 15K it's not worth.	3
17240	Good phone in better price segment with full vision display	5
17241	All good as a budget phone. But I regret the the price drop just after the delivery on 8 Oct. Amazon slashed the prize by 1k with additional 10% of on HDFC.So practically I paid 1650 extra. I never expected a newly launched phone ll be on offer on great Indian sale.	3
17242	Its a awesome phone. Great camera. Good processor. Only down side is its battery.You could hardly get a day. But its ok for me it take only 1.5hr to full charge when using charger came with it.

17264	To handle with..Feels like high end..Camera features are good but capture is awesome..Fast and smooth use...Go for this device at this budget..	4
17265	Everything is good except camera.front and back two camera's are worst	4
17266	Liked it. Even new device hangs all of a sudden.	4
17267	I have been using this device for the last 1 week. Eventhough it is a lenghty review it wil be helpfull.  PROS-----------------> Dual SIM Slot with Dedicated micro SD Slot.-> Crystal clear 5.5 1080p full HD + Full Vision Display.-> The frame is Made of 7000-grade Aluminium.-> Face recognition/ KnockCode for Unlocking the phone.-> OTG Cable is supported.-> NFC is supported by the device.-> Built on Military standard 810G certification.------------------------------------------------------------------CONS-------------> The under-powered processor for multitasking or heavy Gaming.-> No Type-C USB Slot.-> The battery is non-removable.-> The Camera especially Secondary is not up to the mark.-> Speaker located at the back with mediocre sound.-> It is disappointing to see the mid-range phone without fingerprint scanner.--------------------------------------------------------WHY SHOULD YOU BUY THIS ?---------------------------------------------------------------------LG decided to launch its flagship looking Phone (LG G6) under the affordable range (By cutting price and features as well) so finally, there is LG Q6 in the market with FullVision 5.5 inches FHD display which looks incredible while holding in hands or putting them on the table. The CPU is not as expected but definitely, delivers a decent performance for day to day use. while under same price segments you can go for Nokia 6, Lenovo K8 Note, Redmi Note 4 and Moto G5 Plus.	4
17268	Battery back up low, but other features is good	3
17269	Hlo sir my bill lost plz prroved new bill copy urgent	5
17270	Nice fhd+ screen and best camera better than redmi note 5 Pro. Long battery life	5
17271	Heating issue is the prime issue you can't hold it. Hanging at times display is good battery Is not as expected	3
17272	Honor 8x nice mobile, bat back cover bad	5
17273	Must h	5
17274	Heating like hell. And while heating battery drains so fast.	3
17275	There is nothing to dislike on this phone. Expected the battery to drain fast and give less backup, though it is not happening. Battery charging speed is exceptional. The mi drop application got with the phone is excellent	5
17276	not comfort	2
17277	Overall average quality under 16K and not value for money. P20 series is very good but P20 Lite did not satisfied with value for money. There are another options under 15K. Honor Play give very satisfying product than P20 Lite.	4
17278	Everything I liked	5
17279	Nice looking but camera quality is very badLet see how working.My mi a1 is best camera phone	4
17280	Sd card and headphone jack	5
17281	Worst performance ever seen....	1
17282	Good mobile. All functions are working well	5
17283	I've used Motorola phones previously and this time decided to switch to other. After using this phone for 3 days, I am satisfied with performance of this device.Love this phone.. Yaa.	5
17284	Good smart under this category 15000 rs. But during call sound up and down issue. This is very inconvenience with me.	4
17285	Nice phone overall i got it in 12990 and no cost emi that was a great deal...it has perfect looking and slim phone... Phone has good features such as display etc.....	4
17286	All items are Good	5
17287	After 2&1/2 months of usage. Battery life sound quality and display quality is too good	5
17288	Brilliant phone	5
17289	I have moved to this model afr using oneplus one for more than 3 years. Basically the phone looks good and works decent. But the major let down is the camera. Phone doesn't have photographic touch , it just enhance the picture by the software which makes it un-realistic . Touch focus doesn't work well also they have a minimum focal distance for the the camera beyond which it will give a crisp images, lesser than that u will end up in getting blurred images. There is a difference between bokeh effect and blurred background which won't satisfy the photography enthusiast.Except camera everything is fine . So if u don't look for the mobile for best quality images then go for it. Its a good deal	3
17290	Camera batry good sound is bad	1
17291	amazing looking.... Nice sound quality and pictures quickly also nice.Best phone in this price	5
17292	good product, good battery lifegood delivery system by amazon.Delivered at Bhusawal. however, extend exchange delivery system upto Varangaon Factory estate.	5
17293	Best budget mobile best for  video music gaming battery	5
17294	Battry life is good.camera bad	4
17295	Liked for every aspect keeping in mind n  comparing with other brands with same price tag.. Its better than any one. 😍Only issue is its weight.... Too heavy...	4
17296	Battery backup is very poor, just for 6hours for heavy users and one day for normal users, rear camera is average and front cam is also poor. Little bit heating when charging and very much heat when internet using.Not a good phone but screen is superb, touch also very good.	1
17297	Great phone, if you are not carving for fingerprint scanner, the don't over think just go for LG Q6	5
17298	Picture quality very good...	5
17299	Suggest to buy this phone if your usage is restricted to normal. This has everything you need from a smartphone unless you're a gamer. I found this phone review by so called mobile experts as inappropriate. This has good speaker & minimal heating issues. Biggest USP is screen resolution (ppi) which actually creates a very good first impression. Also won't crib about absence of fingerprint sensor as i am just doing fine by spending extra 5 mins on daily unlocking.	5
17300	Product was good.but price drop benefits return .	3
17301	Battery backup not god other all good	3
17302	Very Good Product	5
17303	All the features in huawei p20 lite is great... Except for the battery life of the item... With a little more than 3k mAh, the battery life doesn't fit the need...	4

After baught this I must say I am fully satisfied with this budget phone.	5
17315	Issue are with low light camera..other than that all are decent at this price!	5
17316	Good one...	5
17317	Good budget phone with very good features.	5
17318	"Picture is gd in this price segment.... Bettry is draining fast... Max upto 7-8 hours... Even though I play YouTube video only....Sound is not good... Low sound quality... I have to max the volume to listen clearly on headphones.....If u want to buy then wait for mi note 6 pro.. This phone has gd look and big screen... BT u don't want only look and screen....I would lyk to give 3/5 to this phone....Basically I m a singer.... And I want a decent sound quality.... But it's not there...Rest choices is up to you....If u replace the phone.. Then u""ll get a refurbished phone... U""ll get phone without the seal packed box(white sheet cover) will not be there for you.... Seems that they r providing used phone.....I complaint about it... Bt they told me that they checked whether u r having a guniune product this tym or not..."	3
17319	Price = Performance	4
17320	Everything is perfect.Just battery life is not that greatNot for heavy gamers as it consumes more battery otherwise just go for it	4
17321	It's a decent product at an affordable price	5
17322	Very much like	5
17323	First notch in redmi model	4
17324	Charger point and head phone point in one hole. So its create a problems	5
17325	Excellent Phone! I am so happy using this Handset. Have been using for 6 months. Battery need to charge daily.	4
17326	Pictures are totally blur and colours are totally oversaturated. Colours in the pictures are not even close to original colours. Highly disappointed by the camera of the phone.	1
17327	Must buy if budget matches	5
17328	Battery life is very good, display and touch is also good but speed of mobile is little bit slow, i purchased this mobile in very good exchange price of my old mobile so its worth for me	5
17329	Phone quality is good .. the problem is WiFi is discounting automatically while surffing in internet. Reached out Amazon customer service team. They didn't come back to me	1
17330	About Amazon customer care service, it was ok and product delivery service (Roket LLP) zero star as I have to rebook my order for not received my product on time. And about phone is good and only the phone sound quality is not up to the mark. Other function of the phone well played. N most important thing in phone about camera is too good. Processor working good one. Battery backup is good , it's take too much time for charging.	3
17331	Camera is like best ,in budget.	5
17332	As usual, the heft and feel is good. Nokia phones always feel solid. This is no exception. Similar spec phones are cheaper from other companies, but if you want a Nokia and the solid feel, then just go for it. No issues, performance is as expected.	5
17333	I am big fan of Huawei for the value and quality u get for the money u spend on a smartphone.	5
17334	Battery so good, sound & camera average	5
17335	Camera improvement	3
17336	Picture quality and sound quality is good	2
17337	Xiaomi Mi A2 smartphone was launched in July 2018. The phone comes with a 5.99-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 1080 pixels by 2160 pixels at a PPI of 403 pixels	5
17338	This is the best phone to buy in this price range. No issues faced till now. Camera is awesome and even all the features are awesome. Looks and feels very premium. Well done Xiaomi. Love the phone.	5
17339	All the features as mentioned in the details are available. Good value for money. In time delivery as well.	5
17340	This device has a premium look... Kirin 710 performance is super, battery easily last 1.5 day with normal usage... Camera slightly on the Con side... But it won't disappoint you much... All in all I would give it 4.6/5... Its my upgrade from Honor 7x... Very happy with the device...	4
17341	Wow product	5
17342	Got speaker problem	1
17343	Good picture quality battery back up is low	4
17344	Giving lots of features at lower price.	5
17345	Dont Buy P	1
17346	I like the fact that they are giving slmost 92 % screen to body ratio in just 15 k. In the beginning I can play pubg smoothly in HD graphics and high frame rate but I was not able to do so afterwards.	4
17347	This nice one	5
17348	Sometimes it hangs	4
17349	Front came not well	3
17350	●The special feature which makes it's different in the segment or even some flagship models is it's Camera.The Camera is amazing.●I was using Mi A1 and that was also a perfect phone even better than Mi A2 in terms of Screen, Sound and Battery Quality. But still, I upgraded to just because of it's Camera.●The phone is too sleek and gives a premium look (If you don't put cover on it)●There is no joke in terms of dual camera setup what are generally other manufacturers are doing. (Most of the company are providing just 2MP setup in the name of dual camera, which is not too much effective and just for the name of dual camera)●Stock Android is too fast even 3 GB RAM is sufficient for this chipset unless you play games on mobiles.●Enduring Battery Backup is 24-30 hours depending on your usage.●Selfie Camera is class across the all leading mobiles.●Screen & Sound Quality is just average and not so good, If I compare to MiA1● Call Voice clarity and Signal reception is too good just like the Mi A1●And yes you have to compromise with battery backup, Audio Jack and no expandable storage option. There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely	5
17351	Beautiful design and looks stunning giving a premium feel @ this cost.. Love u LG :-)	5
17352	Best phone but price is to high not prb the camera is great.. And display is ok battery is good i like the portrait mode of this phone. Iike the phone very much...READ MORE	5
17353	Not Duel 4G enabled	1
17354	Good quality, display is  great	5
17355	Mi phones are best	4
17356	I have had the product for a month now and am pleased with the camera quality and display. It is user friendly. Having always been a Motorola user, it is convenient to handle though slightly bigger than I'd prefer. The Dolby audio feature is a plus point, since it makes up for the otherwise low volume. The inbuilt speaker is not great and a call receiver sometimes has an issue hearing the voice on the other end. All in all, a decent purchase for someone who prefers basic smartphone features and who is not heavily into gaming/usage of several apps.	4
17357	Expected more features	5
17358	I like most design of this phoneDislike it is very smooth from back sideWithout cover its difficult to use because it is easly to slip from hands	5
17359	Front camera is wrostRest all things are excellent	3
17360	Camera quality very bad bad	1
17361	Very good product, all new features are not added. But the both of sim slot does not have 4g at a time. I want mi to add glossy finish at the back with good processor than 625. Moreover mi should provide headphones and android one version.	4
17362	It's a nice phone in this budget. Somehow miui was more user friendly,we are not getting those things here caz of stock Android. Loads need to be added as features such as notification panel. Notes and most important the local gallery app.	5
17363	Performance - GoodLook and feel - GoodScreen - V. Good [Screen size is between 5.3 - 5.4, not complete 5.5]Heating - Yes its there, highest when in continuously transferring data.Camera - AveragePrice - Inflated. But it was OK when purchased with extra 3k exchange value. Replaced Lenovo A6000 & net cost ~ Rs 9.9K (excluding 15% cashback).Not compared it with Chinese phone because I want to buy some non-chinese product this time. & its MADE in INDIA	4
17364	Camera is hanging	3
17365	Supperb product at this cost of range	4
17366	Great delivery... Recieved it next day only, phone is good, picture quality is nice, sound is little low and phone is little heavy. OVERALL PHONE IS GOOD IN THIS BUDGET.	4

17368	I liked this product,this phone is a battery supported but their is camera issue, camera quality not as much as good.	4
17369	Very worst data connection	1

17373	very nyc phone with best build quality in this seg.	5
17374	Nice phone in this budget	4
17375	Its a good purchase if you really care about pixel like software experience.Snapdragon 660 ensures fluid performance for normal usage.Camera setup is great and captures decent photos	5
17376	Great camera, poor battery. Audio jack is a concern.	4
17377	Good looking display	4
17378	I m disappointed with phone processer it’s going hang and also there are connectivity problem in the phone	2
17379	Disappointed to see no 'Battery percentage' & 'Network Speed' indicators features on status bar. Every time need to swipe down status bar to check the notifications. Also have average camera & sound. Definitely not worth of such a costly phone.	2
17380	Excellent Quality Of Camera	4
17381	Very good mobile..all is well	5
17382	Good product , the most important thing about this device is it is handy, easier for single hand use and the design sits well in hand . Easy to hold , easy to use single handedly .	4
17383	I am using this phone for two and a half months now, and I'm loving the performance this phone is able to give. Two things that can be of problem is lack of SD card slot and a quite less battery capacity. Nonetheless, almost value for money.	5
17384	Average product.Pros:Slim and fits in a palm/pocket easilyDesign is goodCons:Sometimes heating problem at left side where volume rockers are placed.Battery life is poor. For average use, battery runs for a day. For heavy use, battery drains out very fast.No quick charging	3
17385	I am not receive bill of my product mi a2	3
17386	Good phone. Fit in palm. Nice and handy.	4
17387	All things are going fine...	4
17388	Battery life is very good.. good memory management...awesome phone.. i cant find any negative sides..	5
17389	Great phone. Great performance. Great battery life. The camera take photos that are too soft for my liking.  Misses out on USB C, idk when we'll be shifting to that as an industry standard. Has slots for two sim cards and an SD card. So that's good. Really the only complaint at this price point would be the photos. Front camera does a decent job though	4
17390	Awesome features	5
17391	Liked that product but front camera was ridiculous only with 5MP, looking is nice, and battery is much better , little bit weighty .	4
17392	Just purchase this ,if you want nice full hd screen , hence all other feature are average.	4
17393	Good working fine but battery life is short then Redmi note 5 pro	5
17394	Camera quality is not good, gaming experience is not good only it's design n getup is good	4
17395	Need to improve	3
17396	Redmi 6 Pro (Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) is another awesome pocket friendly device from Mi.Great valuse for money.Works really well.Couple of issues that I have is:1. There are no notifications because of the notch. So when receiving a message or an email, I have to actually go and check out what it is. There are no alerts on the status bar.2. Google now launcher is not compatible with this device	4
17397	I did lot of research on latest phones and finally got this during Dussehra sale for 12,500Rs (incl all offers).Pros:- This phone is equipped with Sony sensors because of which the picture quality is like the one's taken from premium cameras.- You can even shoot videos in 4K.- Though it is of 6inch, it is handy to use.- Good battery life. I keep 4G on all the time and one time charge is sufficient for the entire day.- Received complimentary phone case designed my MI- No lag in accessing apps that consume lot of space and RAM. One can play games like Sniper 3D without any lag.Cons:- You wont get earphones with this phone.- Regular Samsung charger doesn't work with this phone.	5
17398	Really worst product bcz camera really disappointed 😥 and some apps not working propely like ps touch app.... Very bad... 🤨	3

17449	Pic quality is good with 20mp but not so good with 12mp. Selfie is good.Sound is clarity and loudness are goodBattery life seems small as I had 4000mah in my earlier phone. Charging is fast. But connector cable is one not in common use. You need to carry your own cable everywhere. I bought an extra cable for travel.Overall, good product worth the price.	5

17454	Good smartphone within this budget.	4
17455	Hi,I would never recommend this phone, especially who is trying to gift it to their loved ones. The camera quality is so worst that I couldn't compare it with first REDMI 1S. Also, Amazon straight away denied that it manufacturer issue so this can't be considered under the replacement policy. I even asked to return & upgrade to some higher version paying the difference amount but they denied.A BIG NO FOR THIS PHONE	1
17456	Paissa vasool very good display, notch removable,	5

17464	perfect phone with full vision display	5
17465	Goodgood nice phine nice battery life nice look mi is good kli like it mi is best good night mi	5
17466	Writing this review after a weeks usage.Camera is good or above par at this price range. The colour reproduction is very good but the pics seems a bit over saturated. The front camera is also good. Both are good at low lights too. The night is a great addition to already great camera.Battery life is also good. As i'm not a gamer, it lasts enough for me. The battery consumption management of the EMUI is very good.As we are coming to the display, It is awesome. It looks as if we are holding only  the display in our hands. The screen is made as vivid as it can be. But i felt that near the notch and at the down end of the display, some pixels doesn't seem to have been lit properly. But it is noticable at white backgrounds only.The looks of the phone gives the feel that you are holding a premium phone. The dual tones at back side is amazing.Sound is loud enough. But not clear enough.Fast charging is missing but 10w charger does the job.Considering the money you pay for it, It is THE BEST you can get.Thank you Honor.	5

17484	Mass Mobile Of the Month i am Already Mi A1 User just now i am upgrade my mobile	5
17485	It's feels so premium, but watch out for the size I have like above avg hand size so it's alright but it's not for people with small hands,overall good performance I ordered the 6gb variant	5
17486	Q6 undoubtedly got a killer look but camera is a below average one.Some features are missing considering its competitors but for me it's ok. Earphone sounds much better than it looks.	4
17487	Redmi 1s Camera quality is much better than this mobile front camera	4
17488	Good budget phone with a lot of features. Loved the large screen and camera.	4

17490	Butifull nice	5
17491	Its a good phone , the interface is great, the resolution is outstanding and its worth for the money I paid. (4 /5  because face recognition isn't as good as i thought it would be in low lighting but otherwise it works fine )	4
17492	Execellent product	5
17493	Sound is very low	4
17494	Poor battery back-up	2
17495	Good Phone for the price .. only camera @night shots are poor..	4
17496	Good product but disappointed 3.5mm headphone jack and battery life otherwise best mobile	4
17497	Only drawback is his poor processor, game like PUBG running horribly, don't go for it it lags too much while playing game	1
17498	Great dual cameraSuperb build qualityAll day batteryStock Android Experience	5
17499	Very bad experience for this model during 16 days .particular night camera sensor...	1
17500	Pros:1.Battery backup is good2.Front Design is good due to display.Cons:0. TO much adds by MI. For every 5 min one add shown to me.1. Selfie camera is very worst.2.I have 3 GB Varient. If no single app in background system consumes 2 GB RAM only 1 GB Free i.e only 1 or 1.2 GB free for other app.3.PUBG get slows down at low graphics settings also.	3
17501	Very good Mobile 15k	5
17502	After using 1 month.. Camera worst.. Heating isuue..Back side panel also worst..	1
17503	I've been using this for almost 2 weeks now. The battery life is okay.... Not too great, lasts about 1 day with regular use. The display and camera quality is great but the camera lacks image stabilisation so taking a clear pic becomes a chore sometimes, practice makes perfect. Sound is good but and loud, can get distorted sometimes. The performance and quality is pretty good and it works better than expected, worth the money	4
17504	Full HD plus display available only for for LG mobile in this prise.Much batter screen rasio 18:9	5
17505	Good phone on this price range	5
17506	It's amazing product	4
17507	best camera phone	5
17508	Bad processor	4
17509	Very cool product from LG. Definitely worth the money.will update with more details.	5
17510	Picture quality is good but sometimes not best, battery is fabulous	5
17511	Back casing is very fragile, broken for trivial fall .And slowing down lot.	1
17512	This phone is a revolution! The build quality could have been better but over all ! The price of 13k is too good !	5
17513	Awesome phone and hardware quality ...	5
17514	I am writing this review after one month,  this product is away some in this price range.	5
17515	Loved it for the Smartest Looks..Absolutely Stunning.. Totally Premium Looks in a Neat, Sleek package..with Good Performance too..Great Deal price of 15K phone	5
17516	Calling speaker is very thin. Sound comes low.Some times sound it's not audible. Need to improve calling speaker.Some time loud speaker get automatic activated at time of Call.	4
17517	very fast and multi tasking is fun here	5
17518	Right Choice	5
17519	You guys will love the phone with it's mesmerizing looks and amazing battery life. Though I am not a speaker phone mode lover. I like listening to music using earphones so happy with the sound quality as others complain of low sound quality. Happy with the purchase and recommended to others also. You will observe it's beast (processor) performing at it's best in couple of days after you use. As AI takes time to adapt ur habits of using phone.	5
17520	Mi has now favourite for many ones that's why Mi has started to cheating customer. Redmi 6 pro has only a smart look. After four days I faced issues with touch. Many time finger touch is not working properly. Even Camera quality is not good.	1
17521	Not it is recognised face unlock,sound system back is in convinient	5
17522	all gud	5
17523	Very good but it need to download many 3rd party apps like, Gallery, Apps lock, Music players etc	5
17524	Very nice smartphone	5
17525	Superb Display best Camera ..Overall good phone ....Thanks LG..	5
17526	Just fabulous	5
17527	Camera very poor quality I really unsatisfied	3
17528	I'd ordered honor 8x black in COD., I received on time., It was well packed.,It was my first experience in Amazon in buying expensive stuff.I was quite nervous at first for ordering something expensive on amazon.. But amazon proved that it is the best online store ever..This phone has very stylish build quality.,Camera was quite good., some people were complaining about the camera., but I'm satisfied.,Sound while using headphones are pretty awesome., loud speakers works the same too..Battery life can withstand upto a whole day., yet it has no fast charging., I was never waited for a long., it was in a normal speed..,Processer was fast and too good., while playing games., there's no hanging..,And absolutely no heating..,It has many more options for customization.,Notch was way pretty too., display was awesome.,I ordered black one., It had a glassy look and it was awesome.,So from my point this phone is completely awesome.,Usually I write reviews when I received package.. But this time I really wanted to give an perfect review.., so I was using this phone for 2weeks to get to know about this phone completely..,Thank you Amazon for my dream phone❤️	5
17529	Very poor battery life... I used two different models of MI A2 but battery life was not even for 8 house of very normal usage...	1
17530	After reading a lot of reviews I will try my best to clear many confusion which I myself have before purchasingDisplay - very beautiful... I have used super amoled before so I was doubt full about it but it's really goodBuilt - amazingBattery life - very good no heating issue no fast battery drain even charger is fast trust me.. In 20 min phone goes from 56 to 88.User interface -  I was using stock android so was pretty confused about it but it's not much different and I didn't find any problem using it.Speed - I am not a heavy user for everyday s tasks net surfing it's really fastSound - speakers are pretty good didn't find any problem during call or even listening music even I found it loud and clearCamera - this is the most criticised part of honors 8x I used it and my verdict isRear camera - thumbs up.. Portrait mode - OK ok type some time objects edges get blurredNight mode - worstSlow motion - worst it just record 10 seconds video that too very blurFront camera - it's just ordinary typeOverall I will say camera is good not  bad at this price range and rear camera is good.. pictures are clear and crisp.. So if you're not much into photography camera wont be a problem as in my case. Even overall camera performance is goodOverall it's really a nice phone at this price..After 1 week I will review again because it's too early to make an opinion about it	4
17531	Little bit laggy. but great camera...if you are a camera addicted person then go for it	4
17532	Picture quality is very nice, Sound is decent, battery is good.	5
17533	Fantastic I not expect this is looking like a premium smartphone. Performance is great. Thank you huawei	4
17534	its very cool,it is more worth than its price,so it is a very gooooood pdt	4
17535	Giving review after 3 days of usage.only display is good. The main problem is heating issue.for normal use only it is heating. ....	2
17536	Really nice phone. Display is THE BEST. Purchased in the name of infinity display & decent dual camera but in great confusion related to it's processor SD450 (Note 5 pro is providing SD636 in the same price range)  Surprisingly, I didn't feel any lag or so thanks to its 4GB RAM. It's really smooth better than cheap quality redmi note phones. Battery backup is admirable but charging it a bit slow.Also, i got 1500 extra exchange value in compared to flipkart, with no pickup charge. So effectively it's 1600 more savings. Finally got this phone in 13500 only (deducting cash back of 2000 & exchange price of Moto E3 power of Rs 3540 which was purchased in 7000 only 20 months before). So I think it's the best deal	5
17537	Nice product great battery life	5
17538	Ordinary cameraGood design& awesome speed.The only problem is no screen card is along with the product and then unavailable in near by stores.	3
17539	Picture great and battery is not good	5

17541	Powerful & handy	5

17562	Overall phone is best to use... Handy... Durable... Picture quality is good...Fast charging makes it easy to use.	5
17563	I have fall in love	5
17564	An excellent phone under 15k, one of the best in the market. Only one which can top this would be note 6 pro.Got the phone with 35% battery. Used it the whole day to update and install apps. And I still had some battery to spare.Comes with Oreo 8.1/MIUI9.6 with an OTA available to upgrade to MIUI 10.I took a few pictures to test the camera. The dual back camera is excellent. The auto HDR mode feature is really nice. The front camera does its job beautifully.The UI is very smooth and responsive, though they could improve some features. What I miss the most is fingerprint gestures (has none, can only be used for unlocking), auto switch speaker and ear piece during call, and few others.	5
17565	Hcudyzuck	5
17566	battery problem ear phone option is not there is given charging and earphone same place and mobile heat and if long time call talking 15 to 20min  above  in that mobile is any options is working totally that mobile 8s wasteREAD MORE	1

17569	Don't have front camera flash , screen is too small - speaker area comes under screen.	1
17570	The main plus point is the battery back,, which is awesome.. and the other features are also good.. and the notch display is so good.. looking premium	5
17571	Just an amazing phone that is sleek, elegant and small. Fits perfectly in a pocket. Comes with latest Android N. It is said to get an Oreo update soon. Unlocks with face too.	5
17572	nice mobile, but i think its sensor is not working well,automatic light on during call and switched on wifi and bluetooth it self.some time back light flash turn on automatically.so much heating issue during charging.mobile is not up to the mark and sometimes Rings like its speaker has been Bursted .not as like miA1.	2

17574	Nice mobile for day to day use.	5
17575	Performance is not goodRAM response is very poor	1
17576	I am tired seeing lots of ads in system apps. Hate Xiomi phones. Xiomi forcing us to watch ads because even system apps are containing ads and you can't uninstall a system app. Xiomi phones are nothing but a garbage of ads.	1

17584	camera quality is not so good as a1.the price is more	3
17585	Frankly speaking, i don't understand how can people rate this phone less than a 4-3.5I was VERY apprehensive about buying this phone because a lot of people did not give the ratings and review it deserves. But i did go ahead, and I'm satisfied with my buy. The notch is something EVERY single person loved about this phone. Yes, it real advisable to NOT off the notch option, the look changes for not the best. The camera is amazing! I really am shocked how could people complain about the camera quality? ( I'm talking about the rear camera, don't use front that much) The battery life is good too, a 72% with a heavy usage (hint- photography ( will work up to 7-8hrs). Yes, the cost maybe a bit of concern, but I'm statisfed with the phone. Some photos clicked are attached.	4
17586	I m using mobile from 15 days and I m getting speaker problem... return policy is also closed...bad priduct	2

17589	Worthy!One of the best thing I like about Xiaomi is.. never forget your customers.Company may provide you Android Upgrade for a year or one Upgrade only but company never forget to supply it's own software updates to customers. If you thinking about long term.. I guess this is best choice.I have use different different companies phones and most of them stop giving it's own updates after an year but Xiaomi... brilliant!Best part about this phone is it never gets hang/lag issues even after 1 years.BUT here, about this particular model I have something to share with you and is.. this phone has LED Notification light but it has only ONE colour only (white).Overall, best phone in this budget segment.Special Thanks to Amazon.. I got this phone within only 2 days. Unbelievable !!!	5

When I raised this concern to huawei care, they informed that earphone warranty is 3 months and battery warranty is 6 months. Why is amazon misleading customers.	1

17622	Mobile battery cannot last for more than 3.5 hours on a single use.	3
17623	It is a beautiful looking with stunning display , but when matter comes to performance it's not upto mark . And if u have used a phone with notification light and finger print sensor , then the phone will be real pain in the ass.If looking and display comes first then go for it.Otherwise there is many better phone in terms of performance as they have better processor and Ram with 4000mah btry.	3
17624	Bought one for my wife a month ago. Liked it so much that bought a second one for myself !. SUPERB DISPLAY. Stands apart from the crowd.	5
17625	Screen is best in the class with good built quality. phone working smoothly without lags.Main con is the front camera, totally useless. Rear Camera focusing speed is too slow and pic quality is average only.Battery capacity is also average not best in the class.	3

17656	It Bended	2
17657	It's amazing phone. I am using last 3 days. Battery backup is long lasting.	5
17658	Everything is good except Battery life. I need to know whether it has 1 Year screen cover pack or not.	4
17659	Honor 8x is a great phone with a big beautiful display and great battery life. The photos come out great in good lighting conditions. Only gripe I have is about the product delivery time, it took 10 days. Coming from Mi max 2, I have no complaints as such, apart from a somewhat reduced battery endurance. But that is to be expected.Also, the AI mode has a tendency to oversaturate colours, but it can be easily turned of anytime you like.In conclusion, best build quality in the Rs 15000 range and a surprisingly compact phone for such a huge display.	5
17660	Low brightness colour support bad	5
17661	As told by all camera is not so good,Lookwise best to buy,Runs smoothly	4
17662	Value for money. I got it for exchange of my old Moto Turbo which they took for 3500/-	5

17683	All featurs of Good looking honor 8x is Awesome. 6gb RAM work well for device Applications. In some area picture quality need to improve. Sound quality gud with internal setting effects 👍. Battery will end up by a day for heavy user but fast charging missing. Overall a gud combination for perfect device.If #HonorIndia able to give Regularly system updates (OTA) then it will surely became a great device for 2~3 years in this Price segment.	4

17690	This is a very good phone....Excellent performanceGood delivery and product by amazon	5
17691	This was more of an impulsive buy.I was in the look out for replacing my office handset and was evaluating options from the iPhone 6, Samsung A8, Honor 8 Pro and the One plus 5.I was quite keen on the Honor 8 Pro as the 6 GB/128 GB model was at an enticing Rs. 22,999/-.Just as i was about to finalise, I chanced to see the upcoming sale of the P20 lite. The look and feel of the mobile appealed to me at first glance.A mid range mobile with looks of a far premium mobile.Pros:1) Loved the Notch display. Looks neat and unlike some reviews saying its not integrated, I did not have any issues as such with the orientation.2) The display is super crisp. Very detailed and vivid. The One Plus sort of paled in front.3) The EMUI is fully customizable. Till now, I was comfortable using a CM Launcher on the Lenovo Vibe UI. However, dont think I need any such additional support for the EMUI 8.0. Loads of options for battery optimization and settings.4) Particularly liked the quick optimization of multiple contacts from various sources. All duplicates quickly merged and the contact book is as neat as it can be!!5) Comfortable to hold. Its a 5.84 in screen but its dimensions are compact and my Lenovo K5 Note looks to be a giant in comparison.6) Bloatware can be uninstalled.Cons:1) Fast charging isnt very fast. Its equivalent to the charging rate of my K5 Note.2) Notification light is too tiny for my liking. Also, it isnt on most times though you keep getting whatsapp notifications throughout.3) Music volume isn't very loud. I have a higher output from the K5 Note. BTW, the earphones in the box is a sham. I have my own Panasonic earphones which is good to go.4) Atleast a screen protector should have been bundled. Its difficult to cut tempered glass for curved displays. I have ordered online but its a finger crossed and watching game.Overall, its a very good deal with the additional discounts on the exchange.This certainly isn't a MI killer but should do a decent job for most of us Average Joes.The Kirin chip is decent and may not have superb results on teh AnTuTu but then, it gets its task done.Overall, a good buy if you care for something unique from the regular Motos and MIs and the Lenovos in this price bracket.	5

You'll Love it...This is my first LG phone and I was so worried about the size of the phone.Now i feels so good about it.Amazon delivered within 2 days and Well Packed too..Using one week I don't feels any uncomfortable and its so handy to use.PRO:  Beautiful display, 18:9 is awesome (Must try )  Strong build quality  No heating issues (So happy abt it)  Very compact (Feels like a 4.7'' display phone) - Very happy about it. Thumbs Up for LG  Descent battery backup  Face unlock is great and makes easy phone unlock  Customizable UI (No need of a Third party launcher- You have lot of options to play with)  Handy google assistantCONS:  Mediocre front cam  No fast charging  No finger print scanner ( Can use Face unlock )I bought it at 13K during big-billion sale and I think it was a great deal. Very satisfied with the phone.If you feels this helpful, don't forget to click the helpful button.It means a lot for me :)	4

17725	I had honor six the picture quality was good, expected better in 8x and not to my expectations. Defoult sd storage was not given except for very few option is another field I'm unhappy about. Almost all applications stores in internal storage. It's not people friendly, had to struggle every time. Battery life is just a day (I don't use games) which is better than my earlier honor six. Sound quality again not something I can proudly talk about, it's just okay. There are many other features which I am yet to venture. When I do, I will update.	3

17771	"Writing this review after exactly 1 month of use. I was using MI A1 and was impressed with that. As this was the newer model so thought of upgrading. But believe me if you have the same case. ""DO NOT UPGRADE"".This phone has a lot of problems.1. Proximity censor . (May be many people didn't notice but this problem bothers me a lot. Automatically the screen turns on and many functions start working automatically while u are on call. (Just think abt it when you are taking a call in public place n ur phone's loudspeaker and flashlight turns on automatically)).2. Camera : On Launch this phone's camera was compared with iphone x and oneplus 6 but frankly speaking. This phone's camera is going to disappoint u in artificial lights. The photos will be yellowish, grainy where was the compared phones provide a crystal clear photo.3. performance : Not so bad but have seen some lag in few occasions4. Battery : this 1 is really pathetic. with single charge, with mixed usage it would last only half a day. Lets say you plugged out at 9 AM then you play game for 30 mins and watsapp/facebook/insta and calling for 1-2 hours. then you would require to put the phone to charge again around 9PM5. Build quality : build is good, feels premium. This is inherited from Mi A1. But here is the catch,most importantly you cannot use this phone without a back cover because of the camera bump, if you dont use the back cover then your phone's camera is going to get damage anytime. Come on this is just a phone not bahu that needs pallu always.. if you r making a phone's build quality as premium then let it be used without any cover. Personally, i always like the phone to be used without any cover.6 . Call quality/ signal reciever : It is just average. There are places where Honor and Mi A1 would have signal but this phone wouldn't7. Display : Gosh, i can explain this problem. The display is so wierd. with adaptive brightness ON, the lights would go so dim all of sudden that you can hardly see anything on screen. In night the light will go to full automatically.So,to conclude this phone is not a good choice for a normal phone user. This phone doesn't have a earphone jack, no expandable memory and the mandatory back cover. So, this phone comes with a lot of compromises. If you are OK to dump your money for getting nothing extra ordinary then please go ahead otherwise please look out for other options."	2

17775	I have been using this phone for a week now and below is my review1. Screen - 9/10 (Nice vivid display, colors are sharp with lots of details)2. Battery - 9/10 (Easily lasts a day even with heavy use, if usage is medium it can last 1.5 days to 2 days)3. Call quality - 9/10 (Call reception is good)4.  Camera - 7/10 ( Camera could have been better, colors sometimes are over saturated. Night mode given is good and performs well. if you are buying phone for only camera then this phone should be avoided)5. Sound - 6/10 (Speaker are not loud. Sound quality through speaker is below average)6. Performance - 8/10 (It is fast but RAM management is not good. There is no heating issue)	3

17791	Worst mobile glass.Broken within a few days.	1
17792	Pros: Price is within reach. And Picture quality is also good and can also be setup with HDR option. Battery life is also good, standby 3-4days and talk time lasts upto 1 and 1/2 days. Dedicated slots for 2 SIM and 1 SD card.Cons: Lack slow motion video. No Gorilla Glass. Bulky. No both 4G SIM support. If 2 4G SIM inserted 1 will became 3G.	4

17796	very good ,awesome,superb phone.amazon is too good for sopping app.i am very happy to sopping in amazo. thanks	5
17797	Excellent display, but pathetic phone. The best thing about this phone is it display, that it. Period. Rest everything is just a list of cons. Starting with the processor. It is really bad, runs very slow even with normal apps installed (I'm not talking about gaming, just normal usage). The worst is its battery life. With minimal usage the battery drains within 12 hours. I had charged to 100% in the morning at 8. Till evening 8, The battery had dropped to under 15% and by 10, it was switched off. This is the case just with minimal usage, no games nothing. If you switch on your Google Maps then it will hardly run for 4 to 5 hours. My MacBook battery is better than phone battery. Now comes the most disappointing part, the heat generated from the mobile is extreme, I feel like holding a warm iron box in my hand. You can barely hold it if you're using normally for few minutes. You need to take a break. This was my first phone with LG and I'm totally disappointed. I'll never buy phones from LG.	2

17840	Drawback, second Sim is not 4G	3
17841	I am writing this review after 1 month of usage. Let’s divide it into pros and cons.Pros-1- Full vision display (Its just wow)- seriously it’s the biggest plus point of this phone. Screen is vibrant and bright with pretty high resolution. Bezels are pretty thin too!!2- Built quality- It feels solid in hand3- One hand use is easily possible even though it’s a 5.5 inch screen4- 6 month free screen replacement- so no worriesNow Cons-1- Weak performance of front camera. Back camera is quite adequate for me personally2- It heats while playing heavy games3- No fingerprint scanner4- Price is slightly on higher sideOne more thing 3000 mAh battery is quiet adequate for a whole day if u r using the phone moderately!!	4
17842	Super picture quality super and sound quality super and battery life is also super over all phone is super good	4
17843	Super Phone but battery life ,,😣😣😣😣	4
17844	Battery backup problem	1
17845	Excellent Phone with all the features u can expect. Pictures r stunning in Potrait Mode from Duel Camera making background blur.But Front camera can disappoint u with 5.0 mp but it has still bokeh effect.The screen width is less. Width is similar to a 5.0 inch smartphone which  makes a big disappointment.Rathere than this every thing is verygood in this phone.Weak point1. Front camera2 Phone width.	4
17846	Full Vision display  18:9 ratio  with compact design.  Durability was very good.  Best  selfie camrea	5
17847	Phone working osm i used this 11th month and no issued found but now charger not workng	4
17848	Awesome Experience.. Got this Smartphone in launch offer deal at just ₹12499.00READ MORE	5
17849	A good phone to use. Excellent design. Value for money. I Got it in 8800 rupees under an exchange offer😄  thank you amazon.in	5
17850	Simple and stylish	4
17851	Very smooth to use.... Camera quality is good... Value for money	5
17852	Low processor Compare to Price... there is a more option to choose from at this price	1
17853	I brought this phone in exchange offer from Amazon in just ₹10,690, Overall experience of packing and delevery was very goodAbout phone, it just look like a premium phone but on performance it is just average.PROS :1) Very Good looking with screen to body ratio of 78%, very small in size compared to same sceen size phones2) awesome built quality, it feels solid on hands.3) Good battery performance, It will definitely last a day with 4-5 hours screen on time.4) Made in India. I love my country so ofcourse...CONS:1) Terrible camara, really very disappointed with both rear and front camara, very poor quality2) average performance, though it can handle HD games but little bit lags.3) very slippery, phone is too much polished so might have chance of slipping from any surface4) OS is very ugly, though it have Android Naught its UI is like Chinese devices.5) No finger print sensor.Overall in my opinion if u just want an awesome looking phone with solid built quality and can compromise on performance and features this phone will be good for you.	3
17854	Awesome phone for a very good price.	5
17855	battery backup very pathetic. not lasting at least for 1 complete day, which is NOT acceptable, for a new phone, that too, this is not a budget phone. There's NO genuine return of the item - This option just connects to call centre, and the team tries to convince /brainwash saying it works like that only.There're Problems even with both the internet and wifi.. Not stable..	1
17856	Vry bad quality battery life is vry little cheap product manufacturer by company	1
17857	Full vision display... awesome device	5
17858	I have ordered Nokia 6.1 Plus which was shown in picture but got Nokia 6.1 only.It is totally cheating.Now what can I do for getting Nokia 6.1plus.	1
17859	Worst mobile please don’t buy this mobile and go for another mobiles other than lg	1
17860	Redmi 6 Pro is really a good phone with all the best features working perfectly.	5
17861	Here's My Review After Using The Mi a2 For 3 DaysThis is the most controversial phone I have ever seen , Don't be confused (I am completely honest here)>>Build<< : It's A Full Metal Build , The phone is pretty slim and lightweight which makes it feel premium in hand and it's curved corners makes it pleasing to look>>Display<< : So Let's Talk about the display , It's Not Completely bezzle less unlike honor 8x ..But..But , Xiomi has tuned this display in such a way that the contrast and saturation is so high , It's So Close to an AMOLED display you won't be able to notice>>Camera<< : this thing completely destroys the camera segment of 25K , this is literally the best camera which you can get at this price (And this phone can also record 4K , And 1080P at 60FPS , Wit EIS)>>Software/Performance<< : SD 660 Literally kills It , Only 3 phones have SD660 in the market (real me 2 pro , mi a2 and Nokia 7+) and best of them is the Mi A2 - with a complete stock experience and every app (even some of systems apps) can be uninstalled>>Battery<< : It depends on your use , I am mostly inside my house so I put the brightness below 20% , And I also turn off WiFi/Data when I am not using it , Also gps is turned off , And I got 6hrs 30Mins of screen Onn Time (Battery Charges As quick as it discharges)*Pros for Mi A2*- Greatest Camera for the price- Comes With Type - C , with quick charge 4.0- Clean Software Experience- Pretty Slim And Lightweight to hold*Cons For Mi A2*- No Headphone Jack (comes with 3.5mm to type c adapter in the box, works fine for me)- 3000Mah Battery (try to use some simple tricks to minimize battery use , you will easily get about 6hrs of screen onn time)-Theres a Camera bumb and it gets covered by the case which came inside the box (but I usually use a vertical stand for the phone) so the cam isn't in contact with any surface	5
17862	ExcellantSuperb	5
17863	Low Battery backup	3
17864	LOOK IS GOODBUT BULKY PHONEThick phone	1
17865	Very worst product and they internally have there own rule to claim the Warranty. I never seen such crap rule and support for the customers. Please don't buy this Lenovo mobile.	1
17866	After reading all the reviews here I was thinking to return it but personally I felt this product is better than any other in this price range......Pros:1.Display: It's awesome 5/5 we can't expect better than this.2.LG UI: It's really great there r lot many options built on top of stock android and supports customization. It saves time and increases your productivity.3.Face unlock: Not so fast like finger print. But it will unlock the phone  before u type 1st letter of hour password.4. Dual 4g standby: you can switch sim easily5. Build quality makes phone to look like premium phones.6. No lag in performance.......Cons:1.Camera: This is the worst part in this phone. Rear camera is manageable but front is very bad. My moto g3 takes better photos than this phone. I think this is for cost cutting2.Battery: It lasts for one day with normal usage keeping 4g data on. But if you use it with high brightness it will lasts only for 12 to 15 hours.3. Though we have 18:9 display we can't take full use of it since there r very less videos with this aspect ratio. And some apps will not support this ratio but we can switch to 16:94. Heating issue: yes the phone gets hot near volume buttons if you use it with full brightness and 4g data on.Overall a good phone in this price range. Go for it only if you r not a gamer or photographer..	4
17867	Charger not received in the box	5
17868	Cons - At a time only 1 sim card able to use 4GBaki all functions r good	5
17869	Very good picture quality, sound, battery life.	4

17882	Hi,Got the defective piece within 15 days it got hanged and its screen got blurred..Please take care of your customers.	1
17883	Today i received this mobile and tested camera .. in day light camera was good.. but when i click a pic infront of light there is some defect in camera.And its captured in picture also.	2
17884	I wish i could give more stars for speakers and batt. Life.... by reading reviews i was a bit skeptical about its audio quality... but ASA i had my hands on it.... sound is loud and clear...its past 1.5days i havnt charged my phone... battery is still 31%👍.Display is super.. camera is awesome... 9/10.. for it... i was a die hard samsung fan before... but now... i find this device...much powerful and flawless in this price range..Nothing i found..so that i may raise an issue abt it... its just a MARVEL...	5
17885	Price and quality is very good	5
17886	Waist of money	1
17887	this is an excellent product by Huawei, solid build quality, premium product, excellent looks. it is 100 times better than all other rivals in this category, the glass body with blue colour is amazing and beautiful. now coming to the device and its performance, the display is crisp, sharp and has excellent viewing angles, colors are vivid, and contrast is sharp. after having used it for a month. i can list the pros and  cons of this device.pros:premium built quality, not like the other cheap plastic rivalsits a solid device, vivid colors and contrasts are excellentexcellent battery life, gives a day and half on a full charge with medium usage with youtube, and normal surfing and data 'always on' modeEMUI is an excellent skin and very much optimised and is butter smooth. no lags at allnotch is acceptable and doesnt disfigure the screen'touch is butter smoothcamera is excellent, check the sample pics. no complaints in my opinion. we can compare dlsr shots with a mobile camera, but the camera is awesome in this price rangecons:camera focus tends to loose out while focusing for macro shots, has to focussed a couple of times to get the focus rightram management could be bettercouldnt find anything else personally after using this phone.	5
17888	The notch is too big.	5
17889	Brilliant! Beautiful on the the outside and even better on the inside. The Dolby Audio gives a good tweak to music lovers. The head phones that come with this is quite good as well. Better screen than previous Moto phones, fits perfectly into the palm. Good front camera but there's work to be done on the primary. The back panel beats even the best of phones in the market(Highlight of the phone).	5
17890	Build up quality is good....only the stuff is missing is finger print and camera quality is not up to the mark....Otherwise I am happy with the performances...But most frustrated thing is battery......so poor battery I think in a day 3 times u have to charge ur mobile..........	1
17891	Looks quite classy. But while playing a video on portrait mode the full screen don't work properly. Battery is good as specified.	4
17892	Nice battery life and good quality sound	5
17893	Nice product i feel very happy to buy it	5
17894	Honor 8x smartphone ultimately with all features and its design. I am happy with my 8x. It's picture quality very nice. Sound OK, battery life also good.It's has back glass body and scratch resistant.. 8x value for money...	5
17895	Battery life is not good not coming even one day	3
17896	Product is awesome, but I could not find the invoice of this phone.Good deal.	5
17897	not properly working	1
17898	"Hey Guys,If we talk about budget phones under 15000 then we will find many phones under it.But if we talk about the best and value for money phones in this price range then we will definately go for Xiaomi and Lenovo Phones.In india they are the two best company who are providing the value for money budget phones.But Recently LG launches its Budget SmartPhone called as LG Q6.The Brand new LG Q6 is easily available in Amazon India in the Price of 14990.I also bought this phone and use it for sameday.Here is my review for this Phone:-The thing in LG Q6 impressed me most is the rectangular Unibody design,that makes it so standard.The Look of the LG Q6 is so good. With its edge-to-edge display and compact form factor,it dosen't looks like a 15000Rs Phone ,The LG Q6 actually a lot looks like a 30000-40000 Phones and thats not a bad thing.The Flat FullVision Display of the LG Q6 is dominated on the front.The Back of the smartphone is slightly curved that helps the device to fit in your hand.The glossy plastic finish of the smartphone makes the back panel a Fingerprint magnet.Overall,the build quality of the smartphone is so impressive.I also try to bend this device but it didn't and there were no creaks in the device.The LG Q6 's display is so good. There is a 5.5-inch screen, but because of the 18:9 aspect ratio, and 78-percent screen-to-body ratio, LG has managed to keep the overall form factor very compact. Like the LG G6, there are very thin bezels surrounding the screen. This is quite impressive, since it allows for someone with relatively small palms to enjoy a large screen.The display of this phone is higher then Full- Hd of 1080× 2160 resolution.The device has a good viewing angle, and a ample amount of brightness. The device does allow you to manually tweak app settings to take advantage of the bigger screen, but not all of them are equipped for it. On changing the aspect ratio, we found some apps looked a tad skewed. Still it is early days, and we could soon see apps with better compatibility. The screen is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3 to protect it from scratches.Moving on, The performance of the LG Q6 desappoints me. The overall performance on the Q6 is anything but smooth.The company says that it is capable to do multitasking but the device got hang when there is more apps running on the background.If you are a Hardcore gamer,then this mobile is not for you. The only way to play games like Riptide GP2 or Asphalt 8 is by turning the graphic settings all the way down. When ramped up, the device struggles under the load, and there is a visible drop in framerate. The back panel also tends to heat up, which is a clear indication of how hard the device is trying to cope.The Q6 runs the latest andtoin version 7.1.1 (Noughat) with the LG (5.0) UI.The UI is Highly highly customized with the bright Thene colour and no app drawer.There is a option to download Home (UX 4.0) from the settings menu, which brings back the app drawer.The another bad things of this phone that there is no fingerprint sensor on this device but if we go for this budget then we can see many smartphone like the Redmi Note 4 with this budget having a fingerprint sensor. Instead, for added security there s a facial recognition feature.If you puts your face on the front of the camera of SmartPhone,the smartphone will scan your face and give you the access.But the process is so slow especially in low light condition.The Pin and Password is better option in comparision to face regognition feature.If we go on photography,then this phone is capable to do Casual Photography.There is a Camera of 13 mega-pixels with a LED Flash on the back of this device.The Camera is overall good but i found there is a loss in quality while clicking picture in indoor lighting conditions But,the photos clicked in outdoor lighting condition are so good.For taking Selfies,there is a wide -angle camera of 5 Mega-pixels in the front.Qualities of the Photos are as much good so that we can instantly shary it on social media without a much editing.There is a skin tone setting in the camera app to make your face to look brighter.Qualities of Selfies in the low light conditions is in average quality.This Phones comes with 32gb internal storage and we can extend it up by inserting a micro SD Card.The another best thing in this phone is there is no Hybrid slots.LG has placed the speaker at the back of the device, which comes as a bit of a surprise. The audio can sound a tad muffled when the device is kept face up. When holding the phone in your hands though, the sound is loud and clear. The bundled earphones too are strictly average, and should only be used if you have no other option. The plastic earphones not only feel cheap, but sound cheap as well. It is advisable to invest in a pair of good earphones, to fully enjoy music or videos on the phone.The battery of this phone is 3000mah, So that , I am able to easily get by through the day on a single charge.Because My usage included a constantly buzzing Slack app, two mail accounts, two social accounts, watching videos on YouTube, as well as a bit of gaming. Unfortunately, the charger bundled with the phone doesn t support fast charging. In my tests, the battery was charged from zero-100 percent in just over two hours.My honest opinion:-For the Price of Q6,I am satisfied with the design and look of the device.The camera is also good in this price range.But Performance is not so good.If you are a Hardcore user then this phone is not for you.I am dissappoints with the Performance of this Device.This Phone is good but not soo good.You can go for Redmi note 4 ,Because Redmi Note 4 is better option than Q6. But if you are a simple user and performance doesn't matters and only the design matters to you and if you love the design of this phone,then you can go for this.If you Find this Review Helpful ,then don't forget to click the ""Helpfull' Button Down Below.Thanks..Have a Nice Day😊😊"	4

17909	Happy to be back to Nokia after 5 years. Have been waiting from very long for a Nokia smart phone. Couldnt get other nokia phones due to various concerns but finally decided to buy 6.1 plus. Battery size was the only concern I had before buying as I have used Asus zenfone max pro m1 before this. But in terms of bettery Nokia 6.1 plus exceeded my expectations. Even on heavy usage its standing for one complete day.Camera is extremely good in day light but bit bad in low light. However Google ...READ MORE	5

17915	Not a good phone. App not good working in mobile	2
17916	Good job LG	4
17917	It's a great phone. Except for it's plastic back panel. Solved that problem with a matte black skin. This phone feels so good in hands and catches lot of attention. I don't understand why people say battery sucks. It's clearly a one day battery, and two office days battery. That's right, two days (Thanks to Android 7.0) I wish they made the bottom touch buttons transparent instead of white/black. That would show off it's thin bezels no matter what app we're in.Pros: sleek design, fits with every outfit b cause it's just black slab design. Makes it look expensive.Good battery life, great standby timeConsPlastic back attracts lot of scratches. Better get a skin. Skin also covers that Q6 branding on the back. Makes it look almost a no logo phoneNo fingerprint scanner and face ID doesn't back that up. It's useless in night and when there's too much sun	5

17930	This is my first honour phone and I am really impressed.. it has a 6.5 inch stunning display ..awesome design and build quality i ..it feels like a premium phone ..the phone size is same as mi A2 or note 5 pro but here you get bezel less display ...battery backup is awesome ...the emui OS is not bad either ...the only con is the average camera and video quality ..but if you take photos and videos occassionally then go for it guys ..don't doubt	4

17937	I am not satisfied because of ringtone and notification sounds are not working properly. I have to reboot the phone twice in a day to get it work. Very disappointed. I posted the issue in mi community but I didn't get any response yet.	2
17938	Very convenient product	5
17939	Only the screen look nice and overall phone gives you premium feel but camera quality is poor and gets heatup very quick and that too left side of the handset.Fingerprint sensor replaced with face detection which is very poor, it does not work properly and u can't use at at night, while walking.Over all this is a waste of money.	2

17948	Great display, small size and light weight. Processor should fine for using light apps. Software is very nice, including option for hiding apps that one does not require.I have owned two LG phone G2 and Nexus 5, both were sturdy and very well built. Chinese phone never give you that quality, e.g. the fragile xiaomi note 3.100% recommend if you want a good phone that will do you great service for 2 years. This phone has an average camera which is a negative. I doubt there is any good camera phone at this price.	4

18029	for me only	4
18030	I guess you all are confused seeing equally bad and good reviews !!I'll make it simple for you.a. How will you differentiate a Tissot watch and Sonata digital watch which has date, day, alarm, stop watch, light, and few more. But Tissot will cost you around 15 times the cost of Sonata watch yet it lacks in features compared to Sonata watch. But people do buy Tissot for either brand and looks.b. This mobile is Tissot and other China make cheaper than this are Sonata watches.c. This device is purely for looks, good battery if used for YouTube, Facebook, wattsapp and calls or video calls.d. And I don't think now days people take photos all the day, or play game in mobile more often. Its a craziness before buying a product then we will be using only for calls, mails, shopping and chatting.e. LG themes are awesome and customization is good. Face unlock works if you look the same all the time even if you change hair style it won't recognize you.f. My personal opinion I never found finger print scanner so important, double tap to wake up screen and pattern lock is sufficient.g. Have a habbit of charging mobile only if it reaches 20% and do not disconnect until it's full charged to 100%.h. And seriously this phone gives good output through headsets. Tried with my Bose h'phones and it's simply awesome.Final words, phone with average specs and awesome classy looks !!	5
18031	Nice phone, slim and not much heavy, attractive , camera quality OK but accessories with this phone very disappointing and battery only 3000MAh, data cable is very cheep quality . Please Huawei if you sale any item in 15k+ then please provide good quality accessories to our buyer . If you provide a case with this phone then buyer satisfied with bundle pack in 20K. So I am give 4 rating .	4
18032	Best phone in the price range. Very nice camera, good battery life and looks great too. Go for it if you are looking for a phone in this price range.	5
18033	Battery good 2day backap	3

18047	Overall a perfect phone in this price range . its slim lightweaight , looks modern . the notch is perfectly placed giving nice look to the round corners of the screen .Due to class material at back it ll soon get scratches if not handled properly .However i felt bad after the price dropped by almost 4 k a day after i bought it :/	5
18048	Screen is awesome... Almost bezeless phone... And one of the best feature is super slow motion...	4
18049	Poor picture quality.. not worth the money	1
18050	camera quality is very bad , both sidesdear all cash back is frad beware about orders	2
18051	Battery was expected to be min 3500 mah,but still 3010 mah is good in budgetAnd its get charged in 1 hr..it's camera is good..overall it's good in budget.	4
18052	I was skeptic about the phone, but after I got this I was just amazed by the quality of the device. Its  the best phone I've ever used. Picture quality is best, sound is good, battery is the most important plus in this mobile. Due to AI the battery lasts longer, I charged it in the morning and by the evening it was 80% despite the fact I use it often(data on, continuous whatsapp). Charging is also fast and battery lasts long. I'm very happy for purchasing this phone. You won't regret it guys.	5
18053	Awesome mobile in this price.Nice cameraGood battery lifeGood sound & picture qualityAnd specially the look is awesome it covers full screen	5
18054	Battery life is low and pubg game not working	2

18056	Battery performance is very very bad and Heating problem is like digital tawa please don't buy go for poco f1 if u need camera phone.I use only one month then sell at olx and purchased note 5 pro.	1
18057	The phone has overheating problem and the battery doesn't give enough backup, camera is good, sound quality os excellent and the back is prone to scratch due to glossy finish.	3
18058	For the Look - I would give (5 star).For the Performance - (-5 Star).Auto brightness function did not work for me even after replacement of the order. after restarting the system it always goes to 100%.Phone is not charging in shut down mode. when I plugged in the phone after making it switched off it will automatically restart. and lot of bloatware in the OS.For Battery - Works good but for the charging at least 03 hours from 0 to 80% and so on for the 100%. who is going to wait for more than 03 to get it charged in the time of fast charging technology. My one plus comes with 3000 MAH but it could hardly take 55 min. to take charge its battery 0 to 100%. and almost the same for Samsung A5 (2017).LG - whose name is life's good but actually it does not justify his name with this product.I have returned the order Twice and now i am waiting for refund.Please think once before buying this phone because your hard earned money could be on the top of the risk.	1
18059	GOOD product	4
18060	Very disappointed with the product..heating issues.battery backup is worst..slow charing takes more time to charge then discharge..camera quality is also bad compare to other brands of same price cap..don't buy it..you will definitely regret it..suddenly network drops. Requested for return but they Amazon people accepted for replace. Hope atleast that works fine.	1

18103	Don't buy Mi products.After using this phone only one month audio jack and speaker stop working.Worst service centers.Mi is simply cheating their customers.	1
18104	I had high hopes with Xiaomi's Android One offering, heard lots of praise for the A1 and when A2 was launched in India grabbed one during the festival offer period. The first thing that I noticed when I switched on the mobile was the yellow band on the bottom of the screen, thought it might be a glue issue and will fade away but its been one and half month and its still there. But the problems just started for me. From last ten days or so there is distortion in the speaker and the tinny sound it makes is unbearable, its really random. Then from the last 3-4 days the front facing camera is not working, all I get is an error message stating the camera can't be connected, took it to a nearest service center where they told me the issues were software related and a fresh software installation will solve those issues, they did flash a newer(according to them) firmware but the problems were still there. They acknowledged that the issue was hardware related but they didn't have the spares to change them and suggested me to take it to other big service center. When I took the mobile to the 'other' service center they are simply stating that the issue is software related despite telling them that a newer firmware was flashed day before and didn't even accept the phone for service. Didn't expect this from Xiaomi. And not to forget the memory management issues it has, try to delete a large file or clear Google Chrome cache, the mobile will hang and sometimes we have to reboot to get it working. This is 4th Xiaomi device that bought after Mi 3 in the very first flash sale itself then the Redmi Note 3 and Mi 4A, and by far the worst Xiaomi device I have ever owned.PS: I didn't even mention the proximity sensor issues!Stay away.	2

18109	Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?	4
18110	Stunning smartphone... Fully loaded with all features..Quality of camera is superb..	5

18112	Dnt buy plzzzzz	1
18113	Worth the money paid	4
18114	its a verry good phone	5
18115	Reason for writing this review is to buyer should take informed decision.Display 5 starPerformance 2 starBattery 1 star or lessPhone looks great but believe me....jo dikhta h woh hota nahi .Except display everything is worst in this phone....phone produces too much heat but as per amazon technical team ...untill phone catches fire phone is ok...their criteria of heat is 48.c .Battery is draining like a hell .even without use.....lt reduce 5 to 10 ./.And their so called Technical team says sir this is a smart phone and multiple apps are running in background so this happens ...they give me examples of old keypad phones.....wtf😤😤Phone is legging even in normal use...and they say sir dont install apps so ..it will not lag....wtf again.Want to exchange this but their so called Technical team says according to our software your phone is working absolutely fine.Note: when i started to right review about 8mins ago battery was 18./. And now it is 7./. .	2
18116	Satisfied with product and Amazon service	5
18117	Camera ,display , battery  and performance all think have good , small issue with notch when playing videos notch will leave also rounded cutting not there that why video not look so good .	5
18118	Those who say the front camera is poor by merely looking at the specs should compare the selfies taken by it with 13mp shooters. The resmi 6 pro will surely outclass them.The rear cam also takes professional clicks. Moreover the fingerprint and face sensors are really quick. The most pleasing part is its attractive display.The speed and performance is also satisfactory. I think there is no need to tell about battery as it is amazing as always with redmi series.  I'm a fan of redmi series, so I went ahead of honor 9n for this cheaper handset. I got it correct because the redmi 6 pro had gone much above what I had expected at this price. Hats off xiaomi	5

18124	Notch display is only for fancy. All videos playing like normal mobile only. Camera quality is also average. No heating/hanging issue. Good battery	3
18125	For exchange not showing this model why	5
18126	I dislike your phone	2
18127	the only disadvantage is camera rest is upto the markthe phone is just amazing and delivery by amazon is superfast	5
18128	Phone length ok but wide very small thats why phone looking very small	3
18129	Worst handset... Battery drainage issues	1
18130	Product wise it's too good and looking good, there is no heating while speaking or using different app. worth for money.	5
18131	Faulty product sent	1
18132	Battery life is very good as of ips display is also bright and good sound quality is decent not so loud not so low	4
18133	This product is very beautiful and useful	5
18134	Yeah mobile phone sahi hai	5
18135	"It's been 2 months of use. It has very nice feel in hand. I have small hands, and did not want a big phone. This phone is ""not wide"" and long. The notch was the reason I purchased this model, but the novelty wears off after some days and the notch is more of a problem than a feature as of now. There are updates fixing the issue, but I'm enjoying the adventures of everyday bugs of notch.Battery is good, I charge once in two days, I'm not a heavy user."	5
18136	This is my best option.... Awesome experience....1. Great design (specially red one 😍)2. Lighter (very easy to hold)3. I had confusion as this doesn't have notch design but trust me you don't feel difference.4. Battery is good... Have fast charging ... Withing 1hr it will be charged from 10% to 90%.5. Performance is too good6. Touch is good7. There is no separate radio Jack but they give connector along with the mobile and it's really manageable.Overall it's awesome one and worth the money.... Just go for it 😊	5

18142	my G5 plus has better sound and picture quality.G6 hangs multiple times in a day.	3
18143	It is good but not sure	3
18144	Its a new phone and features are well sufficient for a normal user. Configuration wise the phone has already scored well from gadget gurus. So far the phone is a worth buy. Hope the feedback is same on long run as well. However, the buying experience from amazon has always been wonderful and amazon sticks to the delivery timelines.	5
18145	Amazing photos ND phone	5
18146	Totaly Satisfaction	4
18147	The most beautiful and awesome phoneI've ever seen, so compact but yet so big is just awesome. Would recommend to everyone..	5
18148	excellent phoneREAD MORE	5
18149	great product value for money	5
18150	Super design,screen&display. Sexy look . But back panel gets scratches easily. Allover the phone is a full yes for the design. Games and videos is full screen is awesome. The screen is the same 5.5 inch as others but the bezels are very small, adding to beauty and comfort.onscreen home buttons hide during games and movies giving the full screen. In other screens it stays.Coming to features. NO FINGERPRINT SENSOR. Those who were heavy users of fingerprint might feel very difficult. The face recognition is there and is pretty good, but only in well lit surroundings. Comparing to fingerprint this is very uneasy for us. Camera is pretty good, but no slo-mo recording and 4k resolution recording. Even though only 32 gb storage seperate slot for micro sd is available, excluding two nano sim slots. Speaker is fine. But is placed at the back like old models.Finally the performance.I have been using for 4 days now. I have read reviews about the performance specs which ridicule the phone. Yes the specs are pretty low for the budget and competitors. But the phone works pretty fast and smooth for all day to day activities. Idk about heavy gaming stuff. I played nova 5 whose experience was pretty much satisfactory. Stock Os is fine.. Launchers are preferrable. Allover, Performance issues are not noticeable for normal users. No lags detected even while multitasking. Boot time is normal and software is smooth and effective.Verdict :The best sexy looking phone out of all the competitors in this category. Internal specs are below average theoretically but practical usage suugests otherwise. Users wont face any slow downs or lags. Users who focus on beauty more than features can go for this. Just remember, NO FINGERPRINT RECONGNITION.PS: The phone is not worth buying for 14990.Go for this in offer times and pretty good exchange offers. I bought the phone for 9800 after exchanging an old samsung phone (2011 model) for 3200rs.	4
18151	Do not buy worst battery life,I have returned my mobile within a week due to poor battery life after android update facing ring tone sound,needs to restart mobile	2

18157	All over Good.READ MORE	4
18158	really nice phone to have in the affordable range, processing so fast and no lag while opening multiple apps.	5
18159	Pros:1. Picture quality is very nice including low light photographs. The front camera is far better than the rear camera.2. Loved the slo mo as well as the time lapse video features. Generally this feature is available in high end phones.3. Screen is slightly curved and not flat.4. Feels very thin.5. Upgradable to Pie which is a feel good factor.6. Good sound quality too.7. Quite fast charging.Cons1. Battery life is not too good. Needs to be charged before evening with normal use.2. Uses a USB type C connector for charging as well as headphones. Though it comes with a USB type C to 3.5 mm adapter so your old headphones are good but if the battery is dying then you can either recharge it or just listen to audio. Kind of a discouraging feature.	5

18192	Very good smartphone for the price...	5
18193	After using for just a month found speaker to be faulty and gone to service center	1
18194	I have used Mi note 5 Pro and I can say that this honor piece has honoured me. It is comparatively lighter, smaller-easy to hold and easier one handed operation. Sound and picture quality is very impressive. Battery lasts almost 2 days on moderate use, 4G network always on. While traveling in train for 27 hours the battery remained was 38%. I used data occasionally and have single sim.I also found that the Mi phone was stealing my data. Apps permissions were changing automatically, ads were there in file manager and menu/app drawer. With honor, I can control app access and battery usage and privacy which was also there in Mi but useless. Camera was good in Mi. Speed was good in Mi as it has snapdragon processor.I am happy to have my Huawei Honor P20 lite.	5

18205	This is the best smartphone at this price. Best in design, picture quality is awesome both in daylight & low light, battery life is also very good & the display is very impressive. The only thing that is not impressive to me is the slow-mo video.	5
18206	Good device but amazon is best	5
18207	Picture quality is good but camera quality may have been better, photo details are not shown as satisfactory level. Mi should upgrade their product , all the models are almost same but why different model no! May go for it if u want for exchange , because amazon gives extra 1000 off on exchange . otherwise go for N0kia 5.1 plus in this price range if u want better camera , otherwise Mi 6 pro is good. Mi should provide software update immediately to improve camera quality.	5

No screen mirroring / cost /wireless display.3. Very bad/sad experience with camera and battery.4. While watching YouTube videos screen doesn't fits to edges.	3

18275	Best mobile at dis budget segment	5
18276	Size and look great but battery performance is worst ever i seen.	2
18277	I am using this product from 2 days , Here i founds some points which i want to share about this phone -1- Biggest cons of this phone is this phone battery,which drains very very quickly with simple youtube , social media etc usage.But it can be slilthly improved by battery saver option but not much.Battery life is near about 2.5-4 hrs if you use social media more  & otherwise it may survived 5-6 which is very poor as conpared to my lenovo vibe k5 whose battery survived nearby 10-12 hrs.Because this single reason , i am extremly dissapointed with LG and give this product 1 rating otherwise I will give 4 rating to this product. I request To LG officials please improves/fix this Battery Draining Issue otherwise this phone turn into gorgeous Crap with no Use . I hope LG official looks this issue very seriously.2- Display quality is excellent same like Super Amoled displays and Design of phone also excellent.3- Face reconginistion is became good after updates but not as good like other phones but we have to take price consideration also.4- Audio output is ok , earphones audio is also Average but again price consideration.Not any other major problem in this phone expect battery drain which which is very big problem which needs to fix otherwise this phone turn into gorgeous Crap. I request do not buy this just by looking at display after 2-3 days you will highly dissapointed by this phone Battery Backup.	1
18278	overall it is very good.	5
18279	I think it was the best timing for my old phone to get lost and so I ordered it in the first flash sale and luckily got my hands on it. It was the best decision I took to buy this considering all its qualities, from design to picture quality, from battery to camera, considering its price. The best deal I could get in this budget.	5
18280	4*	4
18281	The screen looks awesome. The phone feels premium. Camera is very good, though not best. Battery life is for a whole day, considering its large screen, it's very good. Worth for money.	4
18282	Great phone.. thanks Amazon fr very fast one day delivery.. honor 8x is awesome in 15k price segment.. review after two day use.. look wise phone is premium & superb.. glass dual tone finish back is stylish solid with premium look... camera just amazing.. dual rear 20 mp 2 mp with AI is fabulous. Front camera 16 mp is also awesome.. with so many modes.. display just I loved it .. borderless wide display with notch.. battery backup is also thumbs up.. overall a great phone from HONOR .. keep it up.. I if u planning fr a perfect phone with premium look under 15 k go for it.. it is a king in this price segment.. ☺️☺️	5
18283	Not satisfied with Amazon. bill copy not given with handset. It's serious matter.Product is good. good value of money. Sound is good, can enjoy music.	4
18284	Good phone if you are interested in camera, and do not use it whole day chatting or surfing cause the battery wont last that much	4
18285	It's a perfect phone for me. As per price point yeah it is bit expensive but its worth it.	5
18286	Picture quality and sound nice. Battery drains fast. Usage only normal. Opportunity f7 good in all aspects above	3
18287	Don't buy this product Bluetooth and wifi stopped working in 8 days. Huwaii phones are not full tested .	1
18288	Too many pokect dials. Apart from that a good looking phone which is light in weight and gets the job done excellently. Good processor. If you compare it with real me this one has less storage but it depends on your requirement if you want a quality camera and processor go for this one	4

18309	The only good thing of this mobile phone is display. Processor is not good according to orice range and specification.	2
18310	Good camera and thaks for without notch display.	5
18311	Lg has created one of the best or the best lookin slim bezel smartphone in the marketAt first it might look smaller than a traditional 5.5 inch smartphone but it is because it has minimal bezels on all sidesNow the display 18:9 ratio 2160×1080 is the main selling point for this device...You can compare this phone with any other phone in this price range and you will find out that the colours on this display are vibrant and naturalOver all the device is very sturdy since it is made from 7000 aluminium series but feels very light..Some people might say that this phone lacks fingerprint scanner, but let me tell you than even apple and samsung are going to focus more on face unlocking rather than fingerprint.It shouldn't be a problem if u are not used to fingerprint.The speakers are loud enough......Now the overall gaming performance of this device, ....u can try all the heavy games from playstore..it never lags even on the highest setting....No other brand is offering a display like this in 15000 price range.It might heat up a little if u run games for a long time.The battery is pretty decent and will be ok for a normal day to day use.I got this phone for 7500 rupees . 6000 for my old samsung galaxy mega 5.8 + 1500 for amazon pay balance.You should go for this phone if you are on a budget and you want the looks of a premium phone 😘😘😘	5

18339	after 1 week of usage I am writing this review. I have given 5 star rating for this mobile when I bought this car .. overall it's a good phone.  now I am giving 4 star for this .cz on 23 Rd of this month I charge this to the phone to maximum.  and played pubg for 30mnts and closed all apps. after that I haven't took my phone till 24 th morning. when I checked the battery level it went down from 90 percent( after I played pubg ). to 40 percent whats the point in carrying a phone with this heav...READ MORE	5

18342	The internet connections are put down after 5 to 10 min you have to restart the data again and again or wait for internet....and amazon team will check through an app and they seem to be okay but you have to suffer from this...amazon team will tell you to do different thing and your return time will end they assure you that after the time end they will consider the return policy on same default but no source to connect with them again...	4

18350	Giving. Review after using it for 5 months.Cons first1. Very bad build quality. My G4 plus was way better than this. The glass back has shattered once it fell down. You can ask why can't I use the cover. It's personal preferences. The side panel will also get cracked even for a small fall. I am comparing this with my G4 plus phone.2. Battery life is horrible. 100% in the morning. 90% by 10 AM and 12% by 4PM. By 6 pm it will be dead.3. Camera : not that great. Can be useful for taking a pic of a document.4. Sound clarity: thumbs down. Can't hear properly if we are in public.Pros if anyScreen clarity. Good for watching movies or videos	2
18351	Battery gets drained very quickly not worth the amount	1
18352	Battery life is only 5 to 6 hrs when internet in on, for normal usage. Picture quality not up to the mark. Mobile heats on charging.	2
18353	Excellent product.	5
18354	I have 4 gb 64gb varient phone. Perfomance is very good . I love it ,  i would like to have  6gb varient . But its not available now . I am waiting for 6 gb ram varient redmi 6 pro.	5

18356	worst phone every camera is totally worst .all video and photo quality is disgusting fake 4k video all video you take from this phone are blur	1
18357	Some applications missing nfc and finger sound not strong	3
18358	The design is awesome, so is the battery.. Performance and display are good... Little frame drops while playing pubg which was the same experience when I was using snapdragon 625...Camera is below average and hence a 3 star rating.. I don't know the browns turn orangey even with the AI mode off.. And the selfies are quite pinky for my liking even with the beauty mode off... If they improve this with a software update, I will give it a 4/5	3
18359	Poor performance	3
18360	Awesome phone.. Battery life is good. But camera quality is not satisfied.	4
18361	Nice mobile to use... No hanging.... Nice battery... Look very smart...... Love it	5

18364	camera quality and features are very good	4
18365	Worest camera, very low processor.	1
18366	Battery life very below average for a smartphone of good capabilities and this price segment. If camera is the only focus, then it's a good camera phone.	3

18381	Heating probleme after 3 month	1
18382	Very good product. Excellent battery worth for money.	5
18383	I have tried multiple Android and Apple phones. This is a highly underrated phone by Xiaomi. First of all the camera is amazing. Dual camera gives you the perfect picture clarity. Front cam is also decent enough. It has AI beautification inbuilt for both front and rear cameras. Coming to performance, this phone is a compact beast. Runs almost all high end games quite smoothly. The extra long display gives an aspect ratio of 18:9 which is fantastic. It feels great to play games in this aspect ratio. Battery life is fantastic and it charges up like a beast in no time. Overall a great mid-segment phone going by utility and value for money. I grind this phone daily for 6-7 hours and observed no issues so far.	5

18397	EIS SHOULD BE THERE	5
18398	This product is best suited what I was looking for...Good display, compact size and Stunning look...As an average user SD 435 & 3 GB RAM is smoothly working...People who are looking at iphone 5s or 6 atleast  look at this phone once bcoz of lower price and good performance than it...Face recognition works well in good light , that compensate fingerprint sensor...Only fast charging/ little larger battery missing, bcoz Fhd+ display consume a good part of it...Though it is LG product we expect a good customer service too...	5
18399	OVER HEAT PROBLEM WASTE	1

Overall product is very nice.	5
18402	Camera quality is not good.	3

18435	Very nice and woddrful phone baytery bacup 2 se 2.5 days	5
18436	Phone is good in many aspects but I feel the sound quality via the speaker and USB dongle is low as compared to other phones, photography is great, battery lasts a day with moderate usage..but in heavy usage you need to top up again..also I feel the back portion near the camera gets a little warm during gaming and prolonged YouTube usage..which I think is a software issue..the CPU clock for no reason gets stuck in high frequency..which can be fixed via an update..overwall a great device for stock Android lovers..and Android enthusiast.	5

18453	This was a gift to my wife and she is really happy. first impression is with awesome display and she is really surprised with it. It is gorgeous and crisp with this price point. Another important factor is LG as a brand and I would prefer over other chinese brand for after sale service. I am already using its fridge and washing machine and i am one of the fan of this brand. Dont just go on specifications, Chinese may well seem better than this but after sale service really matters.Overall the phone is very good and 5.5 display can be handled easily in one hand is really surprising.	5
18454	Good product and updated gadget as per the new generation with reasonable price but the picture quality is not good	4
18455	Dear team Honor,Actually I just wanna tell that I've received the honor 8x phone but I got the transport bill copy which is not clear. Kindly rearrange bill copy to my address.	4

18469	Phone is good look wise. but the camera is worse and speaker is worst. The sound ia nit clear and a bit itchy. if you want a phone for calling and watch movies on headphone or external speaker it is good. otherwise spend 10k more and get a better optionREAD MORE	1

18474	Could have been better with a headphone jack and a slightly larger battery. Else its a great snappy, fast phone and has good cameras in the price segment. The only isssue is the lacking headphone jack cause using the dongle is irritating. Battery life is average for heavy users who game and watch videos. For others with moderate usage, it is more than enough. Looks and feel of the phone is also quite premium. Overall a Good phone with some glitches.	5

18499	Vcg	5
18500	a good buy at this price compared to Samsung models. But heats up too soon after a short use even in winter!!!don know how it will behave in summer.	3
18501	Very excellent camara,no hanging,but sound quality and battery life is ok	5
18502	I am using my a2 for 15 days and here what I think about it,Firstly about performance: It has SD660 that is a powerful processor so performance is pretty nice.And due to Android one it has a smooth ui.But it have couple of bugs in fingerprint scanner and face unlock. When you use it's fingerprint scanner it's battery drains very fast and the reason is because fingerprint scanner use phone's all 8 cores on full power.So I started to use face unlock that is very fast and accurate but after a week it also start having problem and I had to re register my face.Camera: Both front and rear cameras are good.Image quality is good.Video quality is also good but slow motion video quality is below average.Battery life:I read all bad reviews about it's bad battery life but it is not that bad.If you are not a heavy user then it will last whole day except if  you use it's face unlock instead of fingerprint. Because it's fingerprint sensor have a bug due to which battery drains very rapidly.And I hope that will be fixed in future update.Build quality: It's a very slim phone because of it's small 3000 mah battery. But because of it phone has very tall camera bump and I suggest  not to  use it without any protective case.	3

18504	Looking so nice....	5
18505	Good but not satisfied mobile size is very small in length	3
18506	Good phone with Best camera and photography features in this price range.Stock android gives you good experience and fast response.Battery is little bit consuming but not drains so fast.I played PUBG for almost 3-4 hrs and then watched Videos for 1-2 hrs, also both the sim's were in 4G mode, that time battery was lasted for 8-10hrs.If your use is average like phone call or internet or watching less videos but not continuously 4-5 hrs, that time battery lasts for 18-24 hrs approx.	4
18507	Not satisfied this fone	5

18514	Thanks to Amazon for fast delivery, the phone is really good. I bought it for my father. He loves it now.A descent good looking phone with more battery and good processor SD625. Phone works smooth. But the only issue is the camera both front and rear not up to the expected level.	4
18515	Balanced phone overall but takes great photographs from both the front and rear camera. The ability to toggle the primary sensor between 12MP and 20MP camera means both daylight and night time shots come out exceptionally well	5
18516	Only for camera and performance not good design	4
18517	Picture quality, sound good	2
18518	Its my First day of using Mi A2. The pack contained the handset, charger, 3.5 mm adapter, USB cable, and.... A silicone back cover... 😍🎉🎊 Delivery was very fast...  Phone is easy to hold. Touchscreen is supersensitive. Very good sound. Display is excellent. Contrary to many reviews, the Battery is not disappointing so far. (It's almost 9 hrs since the first full charge and the 🔋 is 36% even after near continuous 4G internet use . not bad at all. )  Every new  phone has a notch display but this one doesn't have one.  I  miss the 3.5mm jack (an adapter is provided in the pack. So no need to freak out)  Camera is awesome.... Infact the camera spec was the main reason why I bought this phone and I'm satisfied.So I feel the product is worth the price.Will write a detailed review after a few weeks use.	5
18519	Best phone in camera segment	5
18520	This phone is perfect for the middle aged. screen is amazing phone looks premium if you talk about heating issue yes while charging and if you are start playing  games or use the Internet for more than one and half hour and maybe LG  is also want customer  who loves phone rather than a gaming device . Please do not compare this mobile with any chinese products. Chinese always make copy they don't know what is RND	4

18523	Great looks and a good camera. The performance is just awesome for me, with GPU turbo it handles pubg at high settings smoothly. Looks are flagship level and the blue colour looks awesome and stands out in crowd.	5
18524	Working well so far.  Looks good and has all latest features available....... Nothing exceptional....	4
18525	Hm k good product at bugged. But some issues it	3
18526	Bought the phone in exchange for my Redmi note 3. Chose the delivery option for Saturday, delivery came on Friday. Had to postpone and explain 'why' three times to amazon employees as i had to empty my old phone without the new phone. (Create Google drive backup, happens pretty quick if you have a good internet).Onto the phone after 3 days of usage:Pros:1. Screen is amazing, bright af.2. haven't experienced any lag so far.3. Minimal bloatware, easy to remove.4. Not a mobile 'gamer', but i've been hooked ontoPubg (which runs smoothly) coz of this phone5. audio is good, speakers are loud.6. Phone build quality is actually good and didnt break from 1.5 feet fall *7. In-built features are great, fingerprint and face unlock are fast af.8. Charges quickly.9. Huawei cloud storage.10.Changes available for notch11. My mum who doesn't like taking selfies got hooked onto the front cam.12. Audio-jack. The 'Jack' we all want to save.Cons* 1. Slippery af, slid half way across the couch and fell coz of vibrations from notifications.2. Would've been perfect if they provided a cover along with it.3. Back camera is good but photos are bit off-color4. No NFC or IR-blasterMeh:1. LCD screen but for the price it kinda looks justified (given how bright it can be)2. Backside gets dirty pretty quickly and needs to be cleaned repeatedly.3. Camera bump is a bummer. Gotta buy a cover.Conclusion:If you're looking for a smartphone on a decent budget and hoping for it to last the next two years and not look old fashioned; go for it. And while you're at it, buy the blue color [trust me].	4

Its easly Managble size with large screen display, sleek design nd light weight...Very fast unlock finger sensor... Faceunlock also good...Whole day lasting battery for sure... (And don't worry about missing fast charge.. Charging speed is great for a micro usb port.. "" saying becoz u can not down grade this fon just due to that missing facility""Good set of cameras...(i don't know why people complaint a lot about its cameras, trust me guys it really does it's job pretty neat. May be those who are too professional about the frequent photographs might not like it, but come on its a phone not a dslr) Any how selfies are not bad at all in this u will like it, not very great either, but decent.PS: Lack of EIS might be a problem for video recording though i guess, don't know much about it coz i am not too much a video person..! ""hope fully any future near updates would solve it.""1 Gud thing to tell : Amazon delivery was very very fast, got within just two days of order placement dat too all the way from Maharastra to Kerala, without any special payment for fast delivsry. Was well packed got safe nd sound & secured..!1  bad thing to tell: fon charger was lil damaged or dislocated for the usb receiver to get inside the port, but after some cautious struggle got it placed in correct position.Over all very satisfied,*Its an all rounder package*if you liked the specs and looks of the fon with the price ok for you... Then You can surely go for it without any hesitation, I am sure it wont let you down..Tips for colour selection confused guys.. Black is neat clean & low profile, but on other hand it wont show the full glimse of its design or beauty..nd dat too above a plain clear back case put at back.. Nothing is really visible..Blue is the actual colour for this fons show with its back glass two tone differntiation and vibrant colour and design.. But for those who like blue..Red also same as blue, will definitely stand out of the crowd... But again those who like red...I bought 6gb ram 64 gb rom Black colour fon coz i lyk to keep it low profile & i love nd prefer black becoz it goes with any dress we wear, at any time and any where It is..Thanks nd sorry for being lil lengthy...Njoy.. 😉😊👍🏻"	5

18609	"Pros:- The screen! A 5.5"" display in the footprint of a 5"" smartphone- Decent battery life- LG's custom UI isn't bad- Dual SIM and expandable storage- Android Oreo update is expected- Headphone jack and FM radio app are includedCons:- UI stutters a bit while scrolling within content-rich apps such as Facebook or Twitter- Camera is slightly below average- Charging takes a long timeDon't overload it with graphics-intensive games and such, and it'll work just fine."	4

18635	Overall not that bad	4
18636	Nice produced	5
18637	Very Bad Product	1
18638	Initially I had few concern on battery life and performance as I have gone through many review videos. But once I have received product and I am using it for more than a week. It's awesome product. Let me comment first on Battery life, it's good enough to survive for a day. I am not a heavy gamer but I used to play music, surf internet and play videos still at the end I have average 30% battery left in it. One of the best thing is Camera. It's just click the perfect picture. I really love it. Another advantage is Android One, so I can expect quick update.Overall it's a perfect device for normal user.	5
18639	Nice picture quality and sound quality.	5
18640	GPS and body sensors are not accurate. Xiaomi should use better sensors to improve customer satisfaction.	4
18641	Heating prothom when charging	4
18642	it is the best at its price segment.	5
18643	"Bottom line first: I love this phone. I have been using this phone for the past few days and it is running very smoothly.Although it might be a little overpriced, just holding the phone in your hand makes up for it. It is very light and the dimensions are spot on. It has a very compact body and is very easy to use with one hand (the bottom half, of course since it's an almost 6 inch screen). It has a glass body, unlike a plastic one, which makes it a bliss to hold.It has all the ""modern"" features such as face unlock which is fast (since it uses the front camera and not any special sensors like the iPhone X). Still, it takes almost the same time as drawing a pattern. The notch looks very premium although you can hide it if you do not have a taste for it.  The fingerprint sensor is snappy and unlocks in a flash.I do not want to comment on the processors much as I'm not much of a techie, but I have over 50 apps which I migrated from my old phone into this, making a total of 100+ apps, including social media, photo editors, office apps, food delivery, music and the phone is still running smooth and lag free even when using multiple of these apps at the same time.The display is awesome, I can tell a display's quality by their ability to reproduce the reds, and opening the MyVodafone app is one of my favourite things to do on this phone (since it flashes a red screen :p ) On a serious note, the display is too good when compared to other phones in this range and the colour reproduction is very pleasing to the eye.The only downside I found on this is the charger. Since this is fast-charge capable phone, it would have made sense to ship it with a fast charger. The charger that comes along with it is not a quick charger. A fast charger could have been provided instead of it and a lame earphone which no one would ever use. I purchased an original Huawei Quick Charger from their official website, and now it's charging fast. It reads ""Fast Charging"" on the screen and that's how you will know.The cameras are spot on and achieve their best in natural lighting. A few of my professional photographer friends used the phone and they are impressed with it, so I guess that's a deal!All in all, I feel this is a very good phone to have and feels like you are holding a new technology rather than just a phone buffed up with specs which to a normal user like me, seems abstract. Just hoping that the Huawei rolls out frequent system and OS updates."	5
18644	Battery backup is very less it goes down 10% in every 30 minutes.	1
18645	All is good but not company MI COMPANY PACKING NOT GOOD	5
18646	Extremely disappointed with the earphones. There is an extension wire you need to plug to insert earphones. m happy with this mobile but wish they dint make this earphones insertion such a complicated process	2
18647	Very nice phone feel like premium phone	5
18648	Few cons: Theme gets changed automatically.Adds in system apps is really irritating.	4
18649	I'm enclosing some of my captured shots. Friends, you may decide the quality of photos as I'm a beginner of Portrait photography, though these are remarkably well according to my knowledge and even within 17K (6+64 variant). This is also available in 15K (4+64 variant). I will specially recommend this device to all who are interested to get a phone can be efforted in small budget and almost having the top specifications in this price range.	5
18650	No1.. unique . But screen size small.	5
18651	hanging.... slow processor. I doubt if I got new/ original one.... pathetic experience.... seems duplicate/ old product	1

18656	this is a fantastic mobile the main positive thing is its display looks crisp and clear...sound quality is gud but not loud need to raise volume to full...phone looks compact feels smaller in my hand as i have big hands..battery is pretty good...performance is awesome	4
18657	Over all it is nice	4
18658	Has a good slim design and picture quality but needs improvement in O. S.. It should be more user friendly.	3
18659	it is not 4 G compatible.heated like anything. Dont waste money by running behind this. Now i have totally confused. There is no way to replace this	1

18662	all are to good in this phone,camera battery,display perform,s are awasome just a weak point in this phone only some little bit haevy wight of phone but overoll are great,thankyou redmi or amazon	5
18663	I got my Mi A2 on September 11th, it's about 15 days I am using my Mi A2.It performance is good ,if you are a person who likes to take photos and enjoy free time by gaming then MI A2 worth for you.I have heard battery is not that good before I buying this phone, but like all other phones it gives one day complete backup, if unplayable games and watch videos .Display quality is good.	5
18664	Battery is draining too fastFour game or u can say 3.5 hours of pubg will drain 100 percent of the battery	3
18665	Phone is good but camera and sound are not good battery life is very good direct video call option is not available	4
18666	The phone is awesome.i like it . camera quality is very nice.	5
18667	if you don't use camera that much then it is really good choice, i would not say it has got best camera. i seldom use cameras in phone, for me this is great device with an amazing display. looks so premium.	4
18668	If the phone doesn't have dual Volte why do you mention it. Disappointed with amazon	1

18676	Camera quality is excellent and battery back is also not bad at all and am a big fan of stock Android thanks for that MI, only one drawback is type c port am using this phone for three days only.	4
18677	* Good Display* Full day battery* Heating on the right side of frame* It could have been SD 625 processor.* Cute design* Above average back camera.* Bad front camera.* US military grade safety certification	4
18678	This phone is not that suitable for PUBG if you use for media like movie nd song it will give you more backup. You will experience a battery is going down once install all necessary apps like facebook, ola uber etc. Picture quality is good especially portrait mode is good. Sound is fair enough loud.Battery life 4000Mah is satisfactory for a gamer like me atleast you can play around 5-6 long PUBG without issue.	4
18679	Good mobile but hanging problem	3
18680	Writing review after 7 days of usage:PROS:1)Beautiful design, almost no bezels2)Sharp and crispy display, Great viewing  angles3)Powerful kirin 710 with GPU TURBO(no  lag)4)3750 polymer battery, almost lasts for  more than a day with mix usage5) Camera quality is much higher than  expectations  Daylight conditions 9/10  Night conditions 8/10CONS:1) Fast charging is missing(but if you use fast chargers of other well-known brands then it will charge from 10%-100% in 90-100minutes.)2) EISTHAT'S IT!!!I got this beast for 13.5kworth every penny	5
18681	Worth full Very nice to have a mobile from Xiomi with good specifications. Keep going Xiomi to produce good products and giving updates to the mobile.	5

18741	waste of money bettry backup is too poorREAD MORE	1
18742	Don't buy. Very bad battery backup. No earphone port is also a downside as you can't listen music while charging.	1
18743	Hi Guys ,Recently bought the mobile and I was satisfied ,but when I connected the mobile to my car through Android Auto , the real picture comes out .The OS in the mobile has a bug and it does not support Android Auto ,I had raised an issue , but it is yet to be taken care and and at this point of time I can not even replace/refund .	3
18744	Value for money. one of the best phones from Huawei	5
18745	Don't go for it.. My experience given below....The greatest con ever pulled by xioami... Its a re modelled version of  mi4i 16 gb with no expandable memory, every thing is same but mi4i has best camera and inbuilt original mi apps they are comforting... But here in this model like someone said in this reviews section its user interface is like basic models of smart phones.Let me tell u cons and pros.Pros:Android one (it may work).Cons:No MI inbuilt appsMinimal battery lifeIts given as 20 mp camera, but pictures are bot upto the mark when compared to 12mp dual camera both looks like same pics. My redmi note 4 camera is best when i compare with mia2.No face unlockI don't know why they have given typec removing earphones jack.NO EXPANDABLE MEMORY SLOT.NO OTGConclusion :Its like any other basic smartphone with 5.99 screen resolutions, many features are missing.. The user interface is not user friendly.. If u used mi phones earlier u will come to know whats missing.The biggest drawback of this phone is no return policy that means if u go purchase it its ur karma to decide u will keepit urselve or sell it for half rate after u disappointed, regretted, sad and feedup using it.Don't go for it.. Unless u want to waste ur money on it.	1
18746	Camera photo is vey well	5
18747	😻awesome product	5
18748	I liked the phone,worth for moneycons :on 1st day slightly experienced heating issuebut later i didn't feel any heating issue even i used mobile for 6 hrs continuouslyFace recognition not working properly in low light	4
18749	Fab	4
18750	Its rebooting so much	1
18751	Nice good looking phone from LG,it's a Made in India phone not a Chinese made cheap ones like other brands, so for that reason alone i am giving full star rating for this phone.Issues with the phone is heat and poor battery backup.but after a full update of nearly 2TH the issues reduced by 50%Beyond everything LG is trying to clear it's stocks, because of the design flaws and software issues, these flaws are not solvable. So they are going to launch a new model Q7 and G7 this year(2018)..So keep this in mind before buying it friends🙏🙏🙏	5
18752	Very gd product	5
18753	Good Product from MI	4
18754	awesome Phone	4
18755	Ok with regards to price	5
18756	Great features Nice working awesome product delivered promptly under exchange within shortest time	4
18757	Excellent product from samsung in 17k price range. 4gb ram and bixby home, samsung pay(cardless virtual payment method with fingerprint authorization), samsung pass( password less login for any app or websites-fingerprint login) face sensor are highlights in low price range. And dual sim slots with seperate sd card slot. And large screen (larger than s7 edge). If your buying price is between 15k to 18k, go for samsung j8. Battery life is very good. No hanging while using multiple apps and split screen view. And also suitable for games with its larger screen comfortable to play multiplayer games like pubg . With 64 gb inbuilt storage it has larger space to run smoothly. Sound quality is very good and volume is much higher compared to other mobile. Speaker is given in the right side area and fingerprint sensor is given in the back side below the camera. Overall ITS DOUBLE WORTH THE MONEY YOU SPEND .	5
18758	One drawback just fingerprint missing	3
18759	Camera picture quality is a bit disappointing	4
18760	I am not happy more from my cellphone because it has some problem .it has battry backup problem and some hanging problem .	3
18761	Battery issue and hitting problem	3
18762	size is too small	4
18763	Picture quality is undoubtedly one of the best in this segment and can compete with segments above as well.Sound is too loud and clear.However, what thoroughly disappoints is the battery.Attaching screenshot of battery usage since full charge.Until they fix it, it's a big NO!	3
18764	Good product overall however processor should have been better at this price..	3
18765	simply awesome🤓😍😘READ MORE	5
18766	I think I had paid little more but when it reached to me,I am very happy with my shop.its camera is very good.Remember you should not use it for gaming like pubg	5
18767	Sound quality is worst	1
18768	Best photo quality.but look like old phone of redmi	3
18769	Using it from last almost a month. Charging is slow but backup is good.Camera quality is good enough.Fingerprint missing but you have got infinity display	5
18770	It’s a nice phone , value for money	5
18771	Some times emoji doesn't support in whatsapp , speaker quality not good . Baaki sb badhiyaa hai	4
18772	Other charger, ear phone is not suitable for this mobile. There is no sd card slotBokeh mode is super	4

18775	Nice product  and  On time delivery  .Good Quality  Mobile  .Thanks to Amazon	5
18776	Forr	1
18777	The Phone is the most flopped model of redmi, i exchanged Redmi note 5 pro for this phone and this phone ia total disaster.Pros:Looks sleek and stylish like iphoneEasy to hold display size and design.Cons:The 3 gb ram phone is dead slow when we toggle between appsGaming experience is terrible, the screen freezes most of the timeThe fingerprint unlock takes quiet some time to unlock the phoneCamera clarity is of very bad qualityWatching movie for 3 hours will drain the battery completely.The phone can be of good review with the senior citizens, as they will not bug/use the phone much.	1
18778	So happy.	5
18779	FACE UNLOCK UNLOCK ANY FACE TO UNLOCK ,I HOPE THIS WILL FIX WITH UPDATES	4
18780	Excellent phone with the best cameras	5
18781	Worst battery life.	2
18782	Before purchasing honor 8x i was confused between realme 2 pro and honor 8xBut now i am happy with my purchaseThe phone is awesome with beautiful glass designScreen is so vivid and sharpCamera for still images is awesome but for video it lacks EIS otherwise ok (i am not a heavy camera person) its fine for meBattery life is too good getting around 6 to 7 hours of screen on timeSound output from Speaker could be louder but its sufficientGaming is flawless on this deviceEmui is full of features this is my first honor phone and i am loving it	5
18783	Overall nice phone in this price sagmennt with Premium look.	5
18784	Amazing phone just a little heavy otherwise i love it	5
18785	It's just another worthy android one smartphone from xiomi. Everything is good, 660 Snapdragon chipset, fhd+ display, etc. The only drawbacks are: connecting to WiFi is painful sometimes, battery life is not as per what we expect, no gestures included.	4
18786	Excellent product battry life sound quality everything is fine Rear camera is awesome front is too good but low light not supported and also no 4g dual sim at a same time.... Amazon 1 day delivery is jst awsome over all budget fitted phone .....	5
18787	The One for all. Without second thought go for it.	5
18788	Phone design is very good .	5
18789	Can improve more	2
18790	Amazon displayed it as zero cost emi product that's why I bought this. But still interest charged on this. This is really not expected from amazon. This  is like cheating a customer , now emi's interest will be charged to me every month and I have to pay greater GST for those emi's every months... feeling cheated, not expected.	1
18791	"My Google Pixel of less than 2 months was stolen 2 weeks back. I was looking at buying another Pixel, but the prices during this sale were not all that attractive, and reviews for other phones on the shortlist - the Moto Z and Moto Z2 - were not very encouraging. I decided to wait for the the Moto X4, but in the meanwhile had a chance to checkout the LG G6 at a retail store and was thoroughly impressed with the FullVision display and the phone in general.Somehow, I preferred a Google or Moto device that runs stock Andriod and did not want to invest a large amount on other brands. Then came the announcement for the Q6. Although the device is no comparison to the G6 in specifications and performance terms, the near similar display, reasonable specs for my use (browsing, productivity apps, social apps) and an attractive exchange offer were enough reasons for me to pull the card out of my wallet.It's close to a day of using the device and here are my observations (I've deliberately skipped the specs),What I Liked:1. Outstanding display - the large, near bezel-less screen is cleverly crafted and gives the device a premium feel2. Smooth User Interface - I dare say that it is almost like it was on the Pixel. Nice user experience with no lag whatsoever3. Unbelievable battery performance - I have been using the phone continuously after a full charge to install and update Apps, restore last backed-up data from the Cloud, configure services etc. - except during the night - and after 22 hours, the battery is at a phenomenal 66%4. Limited or no bloatware - Feels very much like stock Andriod. Also, I only see a couple of LG apps installed5. Superb pricing - After exchanging a standby Moto E and using my SBI card, I'll actually paying ~ INR 9000What I think could have been better:1. USB type-C charger - No, I'm not asking for fast charging, but almost all new phones sport the reversible C-Type pin2. Average camera performance - the specs and performance really do not match, although I have only taken a couple of pics, my opinion could be terribly biased thanks to my experience with an outstanding camera on the Pixel3. Somewhat low sounding speakers - I usually take conference calls on the speaker phone, but with the Q6, I think my Logitech UE boombox will come of good useBTW, I had bought a Caseology bumper-case and a Cruzerlite Andriodified back cover for my Pixel. Guess what, the Cruzerlite back cover fits the Q6 like it was made for the latter. I was super surprised with the unbelievably snug fit (picture attached - the Pixel sports a 5"" screen and the Q6 a 5.5"").In summary, if you are looking for a near stock Android experience in a phone with good ratio of screen to device, and  - apart from what it is primarily meant for - use it for browsing the Internet, checking mails and intend to install a few tens of apps, the LG Q6 should fit the bill really well. And not to forget, at a price that will make EMIs look insignificant."	5
18792	At a price tag of 9k this phone is a must for reputed brand like LG.Pros: Quality displayResponsive touchscreenExcellent build qualityCons:CameraSound	4
18793	For this price this one is the perfect choiceThe only cons is that it lacks sound	4
18794	Awesome Phone. Bold Classy Design. Great Quality Photos. One Day Guaranteed Charge even with massive usage. 8hrs Screen On time	5
18795	Very Nice phone....I bought it one month back and it's working fine in all the features aspects...	5

18819	Phone is super quality but one point that I dislike is when I use 2nd sim slot then 1st sim slot is deactivate automatically after sometimes	4
18820	Worst mobile which I had bought  recently.. No ring tones.. No head phones slot.. Everything  moving forward  but not this model.. My fault to chose this phone but their (company) responsibility  to rectify my problem..	1
18821	Nice one at this price range, i recommend every one	5
18822	Nice looking, good phone, but somehow there is a huge connectivity issue. Network reception is poor, I am really struggling to make a call. Every time I need to go outside to get a clear call. I checked my sim, there is no problem with it.Now it is a major problem.Otherwise, camera, battery life is too good.	3
18823	I always prefer Motorola mobile phone.i purchased my new moto g6.phone looks very beautiful.running smoothly.camera , battery working very good.no heating and hanging issues.so just awesome phone	5
18824	Adaptor isnot working. Please do the needful asap.	3

18826	Little disappointed about price local shops giving 2000 cashback	1
18827	Good:1. Can get charged fast due to dash charger support.Issues:1. Common node for both head phone and mobile charging2. Battery draining is so fast.3. User interface is not that handy. Need to play around to understand how it is working.4. Not catching up 4G correctly. Tried with Airtel and Idea both...5. don't have SD card slot.Suggestion:don't go for it for this model at value you spend (almost 20K Rs.)	1
18828	HDMI port & Fingerprint sensor is missing	3
18829	Awesome smartphone at this price point.Nearly bezel-less display and it offers ver good viewing experience. So if you want a full vision display, should go for this. Also rear  camera and  front camera takes good shot. Extra ₹2000 off if you exchange your old smartphone with this. LG did a good job and made this awesome smartphone.	5
18830	Lg q6 is the no.1 smartphone at this price and the features in it are very nice.The mobile looks professional in your hand and it is Handy (easy to hold in hand), the display was just like Samsung s8 edge and it is the most attractive look for the mobile, it is also Corning gorilla glass3.About camera, rear camera is good at daylight but little blurry at night and if your good at selfies front camera is awesome with wide angle selfie and picture clarity is so good, I would tell that front camera is better than the rear camera.It has face recognition works perfectly, I have been using this mobile for a week and battery backup was really good as I expected it will give a whole day working even with data is on.The body was well built with aluminium 7000grade gives you a classy look and you can use this mobile without any case.Screen calrity and everything , totally I like this mobile very much,This will surely get updates of Android Oreo and Android P....Again IAM telling you that at this price it is the best mobile you can get so, hurry up order soon	5
18831	Camera quality is too bad, face detection also not working properly, also have heating issue.	1
18832	this phone is not foe everyone. this phone is for those who wants nice big display in compact body and sturdy built quality...	4
18833	Battery life is very poor, camera also like that , comparing with other 20mp camera phones.	3
18834	Below average picture qualityUnable to delete multiple messageVibrating while connect and disconnect the callNot getting good Network signalOverall, many good options are not included in this phone.	3
18835	Camera quality is excellent	5
18836	One of the most underrated phone. If fingerprint sensor, great camera, LED notification light and home button are not deal breaker for you...then you should definitely explore this phone.What works1. Great screen. It's around 5.4 inch and compact looking. Very responsive.2. Phone isn't very heavy. Easy to handle.3. It costed me ~ 6000 after exchanging my 2.5 years old J5 which is very reasonable.4. Call quality is superb. Loud speaker is super loud.5. No lags, internet is very fast.6. UI is very user friendly, atleast I found it better than many others.	5
18837	Over all this budget phone is really good but what one cannot over look is the battery life for example 8 hours ago my phone  battery was 95,% n now after I woke up it's 10% , not forgetting to mention I was sleeping this whole time n the phone was on airplane mode. Battery gets discharged very often I HV been charging this phone 2-3 times per day, n I am hugely disappointed with it.	3
18838	Awesome pro, must buy oy	5
18839	Best phone within the budget Range .. Last night  ordered my phone got delivered in next day morning  by 9.30 am.. What a fast delivery by Amazon. Loved the all  features  of the phone. Thank you Amazon :)	5

18879	Bad picture quality in this phone.	1
18880	Though I have given 4 star for certain specific sections, overall I have given 5 star considering the price of the product. At this prize, I would bet this is definitely one of the best options you can have. I have a oneplus 6 and ordered this for my wife. Truly speaking I felt little bad about myself coz I spent 40k on OP6.. (OP6 is an outstanding in that crowd of flagships though). Redmi 6 pro is surely the beat option in this price range.	5
18881	Picture quality is so poor..	1
18882	Thats a good	3
18883	Nice smart phone from honor.. At this price range user will surely get satisfied with the performance.. there is no dout 👍. But front camera portrait performance should improve it is not up to the mark	5

Charging slow with original charger.4. Heating5. Worst front and waste rear camera.6. And most amazing thing. its buyback value is ₹ 1542.00 on amazon itself.If someone still want to purchase contact me 8800257030	1
18906	nice product but the camera quality is average. Back side is not scratch proof. Maintenance is very expensive as u will not get cover case and screen guard easily like other phones. Processing and performance is excellent. Battery is good and charging fast. I waited log for this phones to launch because of its sexy look but overall this is an average phone. Yes, I have faith on the brand LG. Hope this phone will last long.	4

18914	In the price of ₹13000,Redmi 6 Pro is the best of all the phones available in the market RIGHT NOW.Everything is good about this phone.	5
18915	Got this phone at a great deal. Based on Android one. Very reasonably priced. Good picture quality.	5
18916	"The device is totally not suitable for this price of segment..First con- The built quality is totally worst, Even with normal use my phone got full of scratches on back panel within 5 days and it is looking so old , I can't even express.Second con- Phone is having heating issue even on normal app uses and same if you are on call and mobile data.Third con - The charge last for 1 day and max. You will get screen on time of 4 hours.Fourth con- it will take nearly about 3 hours to get it fully charge from zero. Means till the day ends you need to put it on charge.Fifth Con - Processor is not powerful enough for today's world, Snapdragon 435 ...we will get in 7K Redmi Phone..Sixth Con - Phone is very slippery and if you are using it without cover, you will surely drop phone multiple times.Seventh Con - Display is 18:9 but if you want to see videos on any app like YouTube... It will come in 16:9 only...so what is the benefit.Pros - 5.5"" Bezels less Display is the only thing you will get in 15k segment. That is also not compatible with many apps....A full waste of Money....Highly recommended to go with Moto G5s Plus.."	1

18929	Verdict is Average phone. Not worth for 14999.Display is v good.UI of LG quite nice.Battery percormace is below average.Back side plastic is v poor,getting  scrach very fast, why metal is not used by LG? At this price tag.	3
18930	Don't have jio direct video call option. Don't purchase this phone..	5
18931	Gud mobile worth able price	4
18932	Phone is great and camera is awesome and battery is littel weak and if you are a heavy user it lasts 4-5 hrs phone gets heated up if you use it regressly but if you are moderate or light user its the best phone under 17000	2
18933	I like This Phone, Awesome look and design.I'm using this phone	5
18934	Overall a good phone... But not for a price of 20k...got it at 12.5k on offer.. Stylish phone, won't disappoint you. Camera is average. Have decent battery, haven't noticed overheat. Choose it if you get it at a price of 15k.Update:camera not bad as I thought initially... EMUI is best... Better than miui9	4
18935	processor is too old in 2018	4
18936	After 6 months of usage.1. Drop test passed, tempered glass broken but display is good.2 . Just got Oreo update, There is an option to hide the navigation buttons.3. Phone looks brilliant because it doesn't have curved edges.4. People keep coming and asking me 'Hey which phone is that', Nobody believes that its LG phone.5. Phone didn't crashed since 6 months, performance is fantastic.6. I have never seen full vision display like this on any phone.7. Headphone Jack Became weak, Even it works, not a big deal.8. Battery is average.My Suggestion is to highlight brand name or model name on phone.	5

18951	Hi All. It's been couple of weeks now that I am using this phone. My rating would be just 1 stars to this product.Design - 3/5 (Sleek, good looking and handy)Screen resolution - 4/5, (Only good part in this model)Touch screen Experience - 2/5 (works only on Hard touch. Whereas smooth touch lags. This part is a big issue)Operating system - 3/5 ( Oreo is OK but Huawei's customised OS is not up to the mark)Rear camera - 3/5 (not good in low light)Front camera - 3/5 (not good in low light)Processor - 3/5 (same processor available in their other phones)Multitasking - 3/5 (Average)Storage - 3/5 (50GB available)Gaming - 2/5 (Graphics games are running good but lags in few heavy graphics games. battery drains very fast and as usual heating issue)Battery - 1/5 (drains very quick even though you do adjustments in display settings. Maximum you can use this phone for 6hours but if you don't turn on the screen, battery stays 100% LOL. Very disappointed coz of battery)Price - 1/5 (For 5.84 inch screen, full HD+ screen resolution the cost is very huge. Huawei should have quoted this phone for 14K /14K. Price is also a very disappointing factor)Heat Issue - 1/5 (device gets heats up if you use it for 20 - 25 MINUTES. Usages like calling, charging, playing games, etc.)Hardware quality - 3/5 (Average)Overall I could say instead of buying this product you can go with other products since many are readily available in market. I just got disappointment after buying this mobile. Huawei team please consider my review and work on the mentioned issues. Otherwise you will lose your market in India. Thanks for reading and Thank you for your time. Ashok G	1
18952	Camera quality is great kirin 710 is highly optimized for EMUI 8.2 so battery backup is great bcoz of it.... Only problem is of sound output from 3.5mm jack which is very bad but can be tweaked using Huawei sound effect settings.... Suprisingly speaker output is much better	5
18953	Phone size is not as advertised	3
18954	Value for money, little heavy phone however I liked the screen quality and resolution. Camera could have been better.	4
18955	Believe me ....this product is super awesome !!!! Used for 1 full week .... Used social medias , shopping apps and checked all the features of this phone ...... And after all such testings some of the pros and cons are as follows :Pros :1. best ever battery . Hats off xioami for giving such great 4000mah battery at a very low price . 40% of battery always remains in my phone after using it for one full day continuously .2. good sound quality3. Processor is unimaginable ..... Its really fantastic4. Phone never hangs5. Both camera good under good lighting conditions6. Fingerprint sensor detects quicklyCons:1. Charger and battery gets heated...... U can use a lesser power battery ( 1A battery ) to prevent heating . The phone charger is 2A ... So  it gets heated2. Front camera not too good in darkConclusion :Best phone for budget consious people !!! Good response by amazon too !! Have fun with this beast !!!!!	5
18956	Great Performance and Looks Cool	5
18957	In the earlier boxes, it was shown with backcover and a full display tampered glass. Both are absent in the box. Battery not upto the mark. Charging is still affordable 1.45 to 2hrs for 100%.  Poor display at outdoor. Almost invisible with full brightness. For looks and performance 10/10. Interface 10/10. Phone calling quality 10/10. Good network connectivity. Phone is good upto 16000Rs. Whatever offer you apply. Dont buy above 16000.	4

18983	Camera quality is good but battery life is low, fast charging and fast discharge	2
18984	I have written negative review of this phone just after a week use. Battery was draining in just 5-6 hour, phone was heating like iron box. But it suddenly changed after a factory reset. My phone has got Android pie update.  I did not reset the phone after update which was the main reason for heating and battery drain. So my recommendation to any one updating to pie is to reset the phone after update and don't forget to backup ur phone before doing that. Now phone is not at all have heating issue additionally battery lasts comfortably for 24-30 hour depending on use. Now battery standby is amazingly 3 days. I am glad to change my opinion about my Mi A2	5
18985	After using 6 monthsI will sayWorst mobile camera I ever used even my 5 years old Galaxy y was better in camera colours are completely dull even red gets orange	1
18986	It is most pathetic phone ever with 18k prise tag which I used yet ..dear mr.Samsung please do something we Indians do not tolerate this type of overpriced	2

18990	Nice pic quality nice sound perfect phone	5
18991	It's a very nice phone with good battery quality and good screen... Some camera issues are there but it's  fine.	4
18992	I am an iPhone user but I prefer android for my parents so it’s been years that I’ve MI has been a part of my family and it never seizes to amaze me. I got mine on an exchange for MI note 3 so I got it for 7871. I love the design and the colour. Haven’t used the phone much as yet but the battery life is pretty good for now. The rare camera clicks are good. However, the front camera doesn’t give me that good shots. But you can’t expect to have everything in the range of 13k so I’m happy with it.	5
18993	This is the flagship killer phone. It's hard to believe to get this phone at such a mind-blowing price. Great picture and sound quality. Best in class battery life.	4
18994	Nice phone and smart looking	5

19001	Picture quality excellent Design superb what a look in the mobileBattery life is good but not a very good	5
19002	Battary backup is good	5
19003	Pros: strong built.good look.ultra slim. smooth and strong processer.As I noticed several reviews before purchasing my phone. Only complaint is about battery life (3000mah). But for me for normal use it really sufficient.what I have done is made my second sim slot to  2g and battery saver.and finally camera section outstanding.CONS: NO already pre installed app like lock button . navigation button change option.no head phone jack.	4
19004	Battery life is very poor please friends don'tbuy this product.	2
19005	Good Product.Camera is best.Battery life can be better but you can use for one day by full charging at morning if you dont play high end games much.Battery gets charged from 20 to 100 % in 1 and half hour.High end games run smoothly without any lag,thanks to Snapdragon 660.Now its running on latest android 9 Pie.Case given inside box doesnt covers the camera bump.	5
19006	Display is good, very less functions in music player and camera. Hearing in left side is big hardware issue.	3
19007	Writing this review after using this phone for two weeks.Pros:1. Superb built quality and great look.2. Great display.3. Superb processor, no lag on day to day usage.4. Good camera, but still there is a scope of improvement.5. Good cellular quality.6. Even though it does not support fast charging, it does not take much time to get charge.7. Provided with silicon cover.8. No heating issue.Cons:1. No type C port.2. No EIS support for video recording.3. Sound is comparatively low.4. At times it struggles in capturing photo in portrait mode from front camera.Overall a good device considering the price. Also got a six month display warranty as I got it during sale. Highly recommended if the budget is 15k.	5

19018	I absolutely loved this product.Its features are amazing.Picture quality is so good. Such clear and amazing pictures.Even the screen looks like a 4K screen. So clear and vivid colours. You'll love everything and the additional features to add to the screen for vivid colours.It also has a feature to stop blue light from a certain time. Eg. From 10PM-6PM. Which will let you sleep on time and comfort your eyes in the dark.Sound quality is good too.Storage is very good. You can add a memory card too. Which is a plus point. Since you can't add an additional memory card to a phone which already has a dual sim slot.Also, the appearance looks very elegant.I absolutely love the back cover. The blue shiny thing looks super classy	5

19070	Nicely to me and I will be grateful if you could let me know if you have anything available in your	5
19071	This phone more better than my old phones, i am e Co with its new surprises on every day.	5
19072	wastage of money, poor performance, battery draining . poor front camera.	1
19073	This is the best value for money product.Picture quality is decent with good details warm colors. You can take some seriously good selfies.Sound of this device is a mixed bag but it's loud enough.When u come to battery department it will blow your mind. The 12nm processor shown the magic here. For heavy to heavy user it will last for one day, for heavy user little more to a day for moderate user it will stay with you for one and half days to two days. It won't regret you for sure in battery area.Performance is outstanding. No complain with day to day life. It handles multitasking easily. Processing speed ram management also good. Actually the the new Kirin710 is doing absolutely phenomenal.Software is Android Oreo 8.0 holding EMUI 8.2.0 on its top which loaded with tons of features. It will give a pleasant experience to your life from the mobile world. Nothing complicated to use this OS as some of the players in market doing their OS unnecessarily complicated.Finally the best part of the mobile is DESIGN...making this capital due to it will make you stand out of the crowd. U can't feel the real beauty of this mobile until unless you are not going to hold it on ur palm. In paper it looks good but with naked eye it will blow your mind. Once you will open the box and saw this beauty that's all, you will start fall in love with it. Thanks for the silicone cover bundled with the product as this is a must buy. Bcoz of the glass design u should be more careful and attentive, or else it will be ended with a heart breaking situation which surely you don't want.After all this is a recommended mobile for the price Huawei set for it. You can go with this by closing your eyes. It never let you down.	5

19100	Purchased the phone from amazon for Rs.12500/- (with 10% instant discount + received additional Rs.1000/- amazon pay balance). The packaging was great & the product was delivered on time.Things i like about this phone:1.Build quality is excellent at this price point2.Display is great with minimal bezels and a tiny notch. the viewing experience is excellent3.Cellular reception and call quality is excellent4.The performance is smooth and lag free5.The battery backup is is good, for an average user this phone will easily last more than 1.5 dayThings that need improvements:1. Rear camera quality is good, Selfie camera is average, it has issues with edge detection in  bokeh  mode. But most of the problems can be addressed with an update2. Sound output from the speaker is average, huawei could have given a louder speaker3. USB-C + Fast Charging could have been provided (I am nitpicking here)Overall the phone is great, if you are someone looking for a phone solely for the purpose of a camera, this wont be an ideal phone for you. For everyone else, this phone is great. just go for it.	4

The notch design with glass back is just an elegancy and it's light weight is a plus. The charging is quite fast that fills the gap of bigger battery. The only missing thing is grollia glass protection. Otherwise the device is a worthy purchase.	4
19111	Phone hangs in middle of the call and need to restart again.Keypad is not working after system update	1
19112	Don't buy worst battery mobile drains so fast. I thought some hardware problems. Then got exchange. This also has same problem mobile not good don't buy i am giving right reviews.	1
19113	Overall good product. It doesn't have audio jack(type-c jack), average battery life(need to charge twice a day), no fast charger and have clean stock android (no MIUI).	4

19123	Excellent phone... USB 3.0 missing...  Fast charging missing phone ui experience should have been little bit more smooth. Battery lasts for a day..... Camera is excellent... Speaker volume is also very  clear... Especially the earpiece.... It' very soothing to ears.... Wouldn't feel strain in ear even after the long call duration.... Though screen is monstrous 6.5 inches, it feels very handy... Back blue layout gives Premier feel... Very powerful processor, kirin 710... Excellent speed....	4

19130	Over all its a perfect mobile with all specifications battery life superb	5
19131	Very good product with its notch display in this range, it's an handy product,the phone size is 5.8 inch but doesn't feel big its an light product with very good picture quality and sound quality, Very good gaming experience in PUBG, Angry Bird, stickman saviour etc. there is no lags in these games with Andreno 506 and processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 625.I recommend you to buy this product According to my all experience with this device. Last choice is your because money is your not mine.	5
19132	Battery drains very fast beaware	1
19133	Screen resolution is superbPhone size is good.Facelock n fingerlock are also fast n accurate.ButSecondary rear camera is not working. It's just show piece.Company makes us fool.	4

19137	Battery good, fingerprint so fast,touch screen awesome,All over good phone normal user	4
19138	First impression very good. Yet to use to give proper review about product	4
19139	Good phone with very good camera	5
19140	Size of the phone is too big for my liking rest everything is good. Despite having big hands I find it bit uneasy to operate it with one hand. Camera can be improved through software updates. Sound output is decent through headphones as well as speakers. Battery life is pretty good. Design and built quality is best in this price segment.Overall good phone to buy but if you don't like big phones then avoid it.	4
19141	Awesome phone... But disappointed with their hybrid sim slot.	5
19142	worst worst worst i am very disappointed with nokia 6.1, i just bought 2 weeks ago in between i send it to customer care once, again problems like Over over heating and hang, slow are there in phone. request to do not go for these, waste of money. bloody	1
19143	Allover mobile is good.Only both cameras are not so good. Nightvision is not clear in front camera. Also not very good back camera.	5
19144	Poor Camera QualityPoor Battery Life	3
19145	It is worst phone in my life I suggest all of don't buy MiA2 it is totally waste of money..	1
19146	Giving Three stars as bezel is bigger than expected from a notched screen phone.Rest all seems fine, as expected from a Xiaomi phone of this price range, however I have received only y'day so will edit review after soms use.If u r buying just because of notched display (i mean impulse buy) you may be a bit disappointed	3
19147	Very bad mobile  device	1
19148	Lovely display and perfect size..Feels warm while operating, let it be anything you are doing on your phone.Battery backup is just average, hardly run 1 full day with setting screen brightness on a lower side.Front Camera picture quality is really poor.Missing Feature is fingerprint sensor.Hope the issues get resolved with the software updates.. Rest all is great..	3
19149	I am fully satisfied	4
19150	Product is good not heating and camera good, not in best .	4
19151	MiA2 is the successor to the popular A1. The phone comes with stock Android and fantastic cameras both at the front and at the back.Display is very good. Sound quality is good. Response is fluid thanks to Android One. No lag whatsoever. Battery life is decent and will last you for more than a day - I charge my phone every morning at my deskCamera is the best feature of the phone. Both front and back caneras are really good and offer great quality.I found two disadvantages with the phone:1. Proximity sensor issue - most people attribute it to a software bug. Forums are full of solutions that may or may not work for you. At some point the phone was unusable for me and I was thinking of selling it away. A software suggested on Mi forum solved my issue, so am continuing to use it. This may be a deal-breaker for many, since there is no permanent solution in sight in the near future.2. Camera bump- The protruding camera bump requires you to have a good case. Without proper case, camera lens are prone to scratch and may destroy the USP of this phone. Invest in a good case immediately when you get the phone.Battery life has been reported to be poor by many. I found it to be good enough for regular use. if you are a heavy gamer,this may be a downer for you.Buy a 128gigs version when possible, since there's no SD card facility for dual sim users.Overall a great phone in its price segment. I hope there's a permanent solution to the Proximity sensor issue soon.Cheers ✌️	3
19152	Great phone at great price	5
19153	Touch screen working not smoothly	3
19154	Nokia has lost its touch after HMD took control. The battery life will be effective till the first 6 months of usage after that it losses battery rapidly even on an idle mode. I would prefer buyers Mi over Nokia any day. The only good thing of this phone is it's look and camera apart from that it is utter garbage.	3
19155	It's a complete phone. Handy piece. Battery runs two days minimum. Display is awesome. Thanks mi for this one. I'm loving it.	5
19156	Good Quality,this is my 2MI phoneMy first phone was redmi 2 ,still using completed 5 years,not even a single issue i faced so far.	5

19168	Great quality and product of brand MI	5
19169	So far so good...battery's v. Nice, picture quality ok. The phone looks stunning for the price point. Display's good as well. The launcher/skin could have looked more refined, I'm using the lawn-chair launcher instead of mi one. Overall i think it's great and very robust	4
19170	Honor 7x is better for the same price range	3
19171	Good phone to buy	5
19172	Gud for the money..	5

19177	Bad screen..had crack in first drop.that too from 1 ft max. Earphone jack is also not working	1
19178	Does not support dual 4g. battery life is also 4000mah but only one day useage.camera excellent.	3
19179	Camera is as not good as i expected . Picture  depth is not appropriate. I expected more with 20+2mp camera. Not enough camera depth so photos are only decent	4
19180	Product is awesome for price value	5
19181	It's very good phone under 15000, I like their small notch and back side premium glass it's looking so gorgeous, thanks for shipping me in only 5 days....	5

19183	My headphone jack stopped working within two weeks of buying	1
19184	I loved this phone awesome looking and good battery life	5
19185	The phone is not downloading anything from internet.	3
19186	Pros - Camera, display , call reception is good.Cons -1.So far no android 9 update. Others like Nokia 6.1 received update.2.No customer support and warranty registration like Nokia which has dedicated app for customer support.3. Adaptive brightness makes screen dull even after adjusting brightness better to turn off this feature.4. bugs in selecting ringtones and alerts like sometimes it shows 3 options to choose sometimes 25. Battery doesn't last whole day even on home wifi.Note - Received Android P update today. all good.	5
19187	I don't believe it's a 4gb ram device, in less then month it started hanging , plus battery life is some hours at the max ... Really disappointed with nokia. In just 15 days it got hanged so much that I had to actually restart it just like I used to my old phone. I charged it full at 11 am now at 4 pm 26% battery is left. If possible definitely would have exchanged it with any other device	1

19201	It's not even been one month and the phone has started heating up and the battery gets exhausted in 6 hours! Unfortunately the return window has been closed so I can't even return it. Sheer waste of money!	1
19202	Please  don't buy main thing no battery back up without battery backup having phone is waste ..so please don't buy	2
19203	It has face recognition feature also and it's working nicely. Waiting for the Android Pie..!! Front Cam 20MP, Rear Cam 12+20MP, Slow-motion and 4k recording.. what else we need for that price tag including 4gb Ram.	5
19204	Worst mobile display/lcd quality very bad and phone very weighted and mi service center provide very bad services	1

19235	Picture quality is not the bestOverall I think it is a value for money and is very easy to use	5
19236	Great product!! Used this phone for a week now and found perfect for an Office person. The USP of the product is its LOOK. I have bought Black model and believe me it is damn black!! I love to just put it on my desk without any accessories (like screen guard or cover). Battery easily lasts a day for moderate users. Face unlock is great..works without need of waking up the screen...!!!Just Go for It...	5
19237	Best combo of android performance and camera under 20k.	5
19238	Takes some extra time after receiving the call, dont have video calling facility. Need update for these 2 section.	4

19250	Poor mobile battery backup not good and camera bakwass you can purchase same price Realme mobile like 2pro and 2 cheap price no hanging problem	1
19251	its very slow	1
19252	"Great phone.Pros: Looks premium classy glass with aluminium body, thin chin display wide and saturated, it's a Compact phone with good camera, battery backup and dedicated SD card slot.Cons: Low light condition photographs not good, not having video recording stabilization and less speaker sound otherwise good within this budget.Blue looks great but I prefer Black because it's mirror finish back looks more classy than blue. It's my opinion. If you want to see Unboxing video of this phone you can watch my video on my youtube Channel ""Sangita's World""."	4
19253	The size of the mobile is too much handy. Screen is also awesome nice move from the LG. Really recommend to buy this one if you not interested in finger Scanner..	5
19254	Amazing phone best performance	5
19255	Batter backup is at its worst..	1
19256	Battery back up quality is very bad other function is better	1

19259	Picture quality is good but not so good	4
19260	Camera was not upto expected mark and give blur effect after a month , sound is very normal not too good	2
19261	average product at this price. I aspect more but okk. average product.	3
19262	The red color is finer and even more glossier than in picture. I got mesmerized as soon as i turned the phone back. Moreover picture quality is great. 60fps suits well on it. The face unlock works in micro seconds with only a second of calibration unlike in iphone X where you have to rotate our face multiple time to calibrate. The small frame videos can be zoomed to fill the screen without cutting any part of it. Camera Portrait mode is amazing, I took my mom's first pic on it, she just awed. The 5.8 inch screen is just good and it's quite handy to use in one hand.The courier guy came to me and just checked the IMEI and i received the phone in exchange. It cost me INR 7000. Thanks amazon for coupons and easy exchange policy.Though the front cam is a little shortcoming for picture quality, i would have to say i am not a selfie lover.Thank you Jeff Bezos!!	5
19263	Good but need to provide xiomi applications	4
19264	handy phone...	5
19265	As usual Amazon the best, & Mi 6 pro is just awesome.	5
19266	First of all let me talk about the design. It's awesome and I would rate10/10 for design.Pros: 1. The design is the main reason why I bought this phone  it feels so premium 10/102. Display is awesome as well. You will never be disappointed 10/103. Performance is smooth. It's good enough to handle any task. Games can be played without any lag 9/104. Battery is satisfactory too. I play one hour of game a day( war robot). Use WhatsApp amytime. Browse from Google Chrome for atleast 1 n half hrs a day. Watch YouTube videos for an average of 2 n half hrs a day. And it last for a day easily. 9/10Cons:1. Camera is the biggest disappointment. I have compared it with redmi note 5 pro. Redmi wins in most of the challenge. Color reproduction is pathetic. The only way out is to use the pro mode. Atleast you can get a good image using the pro mode. I really hope that they will fix the camera issues in the software update. 7/10 for honor 8x and 9/10 for redmi note 5 pro2. Audio is not good enough. It not that loud. 8/10. But bottom line is, it is just 15k so it's worth it. Great Value for money.	4
19267	My second MI phone and I don't regret it.	5
19268	good and fine	3
19269	Nice phone not bad in this price..	4
19270	Redmi 6 pro is the successor of Redmi Note 5 . after Usage of 3 day Fully i am writing the review herePros1. Affordable Notch 😀2. 4000 mah battery3. Convertible to full screen mode4.

19277	osm phone	5
19278	It's an amazing product....😍	5
19279	It was a good product. I like it	5
19280	I am writing a review after using it for 20 days or more. Sim slot 1 doesn't support 4g sim from the first day I received and unboxed. After visiting so many times at the service centre in last few days for the issue but it hasn't been resolved yet. It also heats on charging or on long hours of use as all other MI phones. Sometimes get hang don't know why it happens. The camera is also average. You cannot click selfies from this phone. If you are a selfie freak stay away from this phone. Product not worth cheap product at the high price. Its onetime investment we cannot buy a new phone after a few days later when not satisfied with the one purchased earlier.	2
19281	Mobile quality is good...but the back cover with this mobile is not protect camera	5
19282	its a amazing phone	5
19283	The design and the screen is just lovely. Overall a very good device. Not a great camera but its not a deal breaker.	4
19284	It's a very clean phone. Great photos for it's price and the android one is super smooth. Accessories are not yet widely available specifically earphones but nonetheless nice product. Recommended at 15K	4
19285	I bought this phone last week phone is good ,overall quality is awsm.	5
19286	good phone. But yeah need some improvement in miui version. Cause it is hanging.Selfie camera is average but yeah video quality and even slow motion quality is not as good as we expect.	4

I never thought the quality of the glass is like a normal glass. I was a fan of honor band mobile but after this i am sorry to say do not buy. Waste of money	3

19297	Very Good mobile in this price range	5
19298	Very good quality& performance	5
19299	Unfortunately I have received faulty handset..If while watching video call comes, ringtone sounds like crying.. ringtone plays very slow like a battery is low. ( SAME LIKE OUR WALKMAN USED TO SOUND WITH LOW BATTERY)	1
19300	Battery is less	3
19301	Battery life is not so we'll charge 2 times on day	4
19302	The display is just great, but you need to find proper 18:9 content to really enjoy it. Processor is kind of ok, but definitely not suited for heavy tasks like gaming. The camera is also ok, but nothing exceptional, though its good in daylight. Poor performance in night shots. The battery life is also ok, but nothing great. I charge in the night to 100% and by 7pm it comes down to about 30-40%.So overall a pretty good phone and the best phone under 15k which has the 18:9 display with the slimmest bezels	4
19303	don't waste you money with this product, really worst camera quality and heating a lot, and you couldn't able to return alsoso don't buy this product	1

19317	"Old wine in new bottle. The phone is average not good nor great. Points to consider before buying it :1. Snapdragon 625Snapdragon 625 is very old processor. First introduced in Redmi note 4 in January, 2017. Almost 2 years old processor is used in this phone.2. Small displayDon't go by 5.8 inch display. Actually the display is smaller than 5.5 inch Redmi note 3. Redmi 6 pro has long height but width is very small. Overall it is not good for reading books or news.3. BloatwareJust after opening the phone you receive the message of ""update"". And the worst thing is you cannot disable update notification.4. Annoying adsMi shows various ads. While running your phone you will receive the ads out of nowhere. {Solution: disable ""app recommendation"" in browser, file manager and security app}5. Poor CameraEven after having two cameras, the images taken by this phone are very poor. It has 12 +5 mega pixel back camera and 5 megapixel front camera. Selfies come out to be over white, whereas back camera cannot take crisp and clear images.6. BatteryThe only good in this phone is battery which can last up to 2 days. But after using dual sim in it, it gave me just 1 day backup.7. Call qualityIt has very small speaker for hearing calls. Almost half the size of other phones. By increasing the size of screen, they have reduced the size of speaker.8. PerformanceSnapdragon 625 gives average performance. If you want good performance then go for snapdragon 660 (Realme 2 pro or mi A2).ConclusionBuy this phone if you want a small compact phone with good battery life for everyday use. Don't buy it for gaming and video editing stuff."	3

19326	Reviews MI A2In The BOX1 * MI A2 Mobile Headset1 * Type C to 3.5mm Jack Dongle1 * Mobile Back Cover(Transparent)1 * C Type Usb Cable1 * Charger AdapterWhat I Like1.It has a big 5.99-inch display with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Full HD+ IPS LCD display, 2.5D Gorilla Glass 3. pixel density of 403ppi2.Processor:- 2.2GHz octa-core Snapdragon 660 processor.Adreno 512 GPU. Performance is Decent3.Os :-Stock Android Oreo4.Camera :-20MP+12MP Front Camera 20MP, 1080p Videos Selfie Light. Camera Performance is Awesome5.Metallic unibody design,6.This is a dual-SIM smartphone and has two Nano-SIM slots. There is support for 4G and VoLTE on both SIMs.7.Finger & face Unlock. Finger Scanner is fast. Face unlock is Always Cool.IR BlasterWhat I Don't Like1.At  this range 3010 mAh, the battery capacity is lower than what most other smartphones in this segment offer.Lower battery only Stand 8-9 Hours.2. The handset is said to come with Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 for fast-charging support, but unfortunately, the charger that you get in the box is not a fast charger.3.Sound Quality is Not upto Mark4.It Does not Come With 3.5MM jack..Which is obviously  is not Good for Music Lover.U alway need Dongle Type C to 3.5mm Jack5.No expandable Memory at this Range Highly Disappoint.6.Back Camera is Bump.Verdict.if you are Camera Lover Go For It.Otherwise think Before Buying IT.	4

19334	I was actually looking for a phone which would satisfy me with a good battery it was enough for me but this phone has everything else like good camera quality wherein it was given to my 2.9 ratings but I would like to rate as 4.5 for camera, 4.5 for sound quality, 5 for battery, so my overall ratings would be 4.5-5...bit confused because of slow motion is not given in this phone but although it's a great phone with really very cheap budget.	5

19343	Thanks for Amazon for quick delivery. Migrating from iPhone user it was bit difficult to get used to Android UI. Thanks for LG Q6- One hand usage techniques helps to navigate across menus. Every other options like Screen display, Data backup, Camera options, Touch sensitive works fine. Downloaded couple of games- Delivered decent performance.You can see a fraction time to load webpages and content while using youtube- this reflects a negligible lag. Front camera did a great job unlike front camera.Overall I feel quite lots of features are packed under 20k budget to capture Indian market by LG.No need for second thought. You wont regret after buying it.	4

19477	i would say donate your all money to a needy but never purchase nokia 6.1. frequently getting hanged on.camera with zeiss lens not capturing good snaps , it  is worst . normal android apps donot compatible with the androidone os given. it should be priced around Rs4500/-. screen resolution is very poor. if really want to make someone fool or want to take revenge from your someone then give a gift of NOKIA6.1. I am sure you will be successful in retaliating..	1
19478	Poor battery life. SD card is not detected for the first time without formatting. You need to format the SD card to be able to use in G6.Camera app sucks. Most of the times I need to clear cache and data to make the camera options work. And now the screen shot is not working eventhough more internal space is there.	1
19479	Fingerprint slow,	2
19480	About mi a2 all things are good	5
19481	One piece of advice, the charger that comes along is shit, you'r gonna have to buy your own 2A 5V charger to ensure it charges under 1.5 hours. The stock charger takes upto 4 hours to charge this phone.	3
19482	Nice production of LG	4
19483	The first phone I purchased by honor, awesome phone, picture quality superb, camera too good. Back cover and screen gaurd given by honor, this is very good for every one	5
19484	Picture quality is really good and perfect, sound quality better than Mi Y2 , battery life is worth without playing games and watching videos. Because it will reduce fastly playing games.	4
19485	Great mobile but also try k8 note by lenovo... Much cheaper and great specs	5

19501	Brought this as a gift for my mother during the Amazon Sale. Yet again I am super impressed with Amazon delivery as I am a prime customer. May be!With very minimal usage It’s been 16days that I have charged the phone and it still stands at around 25% battery.Built us beautiful.The screen size and picture quality is just amazing. I am true apple Fan and have been only using apple since 5 years now but after using this phone that I brought for my mom I am truly impressed. People will get fooled by the looks as it exactly looks like an iPhone X.Excellent product for the price. Very happy!	5
19502	Hey Guys, Maybe you guys are planning to buy this product, here is a full and final unbiased review go for it and don’t forget to give this review a like rating if it really helps you guys with the product.Let’s talk about  it categoricaly :In the box:- Handset with built in battery.- Headphones (Not the in-ear type, just the simple ones which won't be probably used ever).- Power brick.- USB to micro USB cable.- Information leaflets.Advantages of this phone over others in same price segment:- Biggest plus is the full vision full HD+ (2160 x 1080 pixels) display with a pixel density of 442 ppi. This kind of display is first in the price segment.- Made of 7000 grade aluminium making it tough and durable but note that it is only the frame & not the back.- Snapdragon 435 which is the current generation chip as compared to 430 being used in nokia 6 which is a generation old.- Dedicated dual sim slot and separate micro SD card slot.- Single hand use possible despite 5.5' screen thanks to the thin bezels- Latest android version 7.1.1 Nougat- Launch offer of one time free screen replacement within 6 months.Where it lacks:- No fingerprint scanner.- Speaker located at the back.- Many phones in this price segment come with Snapdragon 600 series SOC , so in gaming & heave duty performance it will lag in comparision to Chinese brands.Impressions after receiving the phone:-DISPLAY:The main selling point of the phone. It comes with a full vision full HD+ (2160 x 1080 pixels) display with a pixel density of 442 ppi and is just gorgeous to look at. Easily the best display in the sub 20k category. In fact if just the display is considered then this gives the flagship experience.RATING - 5/5BUILD QUALITY:Pros:-- Made of 7000 series aluminium which is resistant to scratches and toughens up the phone, has a military grade build certification but only the side frame.- Comes with dual nano sim slot along with a dedicated micro SD slot expandable upto a whooping 2tb.- Weighs at just 149 gms which is excellent for a 5.5' phone.- Screen has corning gorilla glass 3 protection (Source - GSM arena) plus the company is offering one time free screen replacement within 6 months of purchase.- Yes it has a LED notification light (Not there in big brother LG G6).- Comes with all the imp sensors (Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass). Generally in this price segment reputed companies like Samsung have been known to emit some imp sensor to cut costs.Cons:-- Major area where it lacks in my opinion is the placement of speaker at the back which will muffle up the sound when it is kept on soft surfaces like bed or sofa, also the speaker opening can be easily covered by hands when watching videos or playing games. Hence the potential of a great multimedia experience thanks to the gorgeous screen will be spoiled a bit.- No fingerprint scanner which is a std these days (Comes with a 3D face recognition though, the effectiveness of which remains to be seen).- Only the side frame is high grade alumimium but back is made of plastic which is a fingerprint magnet somehow.- Also no IP rating, normally we see that feature on much more expensive phones but budget phones have come with this feature in the past like Moto G3RATING - 3.5/5PERFORMANCE:It has an octa core Snapdragon 435 SoC with 3GB RAM and 32 GB inbuilt storage which is running on the latest Android version 7.1.1 to maximise it's potential and is still better than a generation old Snapdragon 430 SoC used in soon to be released Nokia 6. But in this price segment there are devices available which have Snapdragon 600 Series SoC which is better. So in terms of performance the Q6 lags and if you are a gamer who likes to play high graphic games then you will be disappointed with the lag. Otherwise for a light to moderate user not much into gaming, this Soc will take you through your daily tasks without any hiccups.RATING - 3/5BATTERY:Comes with a non removable 3000 mAh battery which on paper is average and should last an entire day under normal use. Depends how LG has maximised the potential of the SD 435 SoC which is not as battery friendly as SD 625.This phone does not support quick charge (To be verifies) and the power brick supplied has a rating of 5V, 1.2A which is very ordinary and below average even for the phones in this price segment & a micro USB cable (Not type C). Will update this section after using the phone for a few days on the battery juice and the charging time.RATING 3.5/5CAMERA:Comes with a 13mp rear shooter with f/2.2 aperture. Might not stand up to the phones having dual cameras in this price segment on paper but the initial impressions are that it fares well. Images are crisp with a good dynamic range, fast focus. Suffers a bit though when images are zoomed in but can't really complain for this price range. Low light images are decent thanks to the OIS present which is excellent to have in the price range. Capable of recording full HD videos.Front shooter is 5mp again with a f/2.2 aperture and seems to be a bit average. Highlight here is wide angle selfie shooter (100 degrees compared to the standard 82 degrees).RATING - 4/5My thoughts=========If you aren't a hardcore gamer or heavy user then you'll enjoy this phone. Yes there are some major flaws (No fingerprint scanner, placement of speakers), but if you can overlook them for that gorgeos display at this price point from a reputed brand like LG then don't think twice. Keep in mind that in the same price there are many Chinese brands offering better specs BUT AFTER SALES MATTERS !!And many things depends upon how we use the product ,which is different in everyone’s case. Otherwise great product at an amazing price range.Thanks for reading my review, I hope it provided all the information for a wise and well-informed purchase decision. It always makes me feel proud that people find my reviews helpful.If you have any query or confused about buying this item then feel free to comment here.	4

19558	The phone is just ok.So far so good with the phone! I'm not happy with my purchase and the price.I like everything about this phone (screen, size, ..) except the CAMERA which is terrible. It is a fixed focus camera. So if you want to take a picture of something close, like a sheet of paper, a bill, ..., it is so out of focus that it is unreadable. That is really too bad,Do not buy LG phone.	2

19569	Good build quality, smooth processing, very good producf inthis price range.	5
19570	Very good phone for money. There is a nice feel about the phone coming in from LG. Display is a class part. Music output is excellent - you should use Poweramp app though for that.I tested with Audio technica M40 and it was great.The LG default app on Music doesnt give good quality. The default keyboard needs to be replaced with Gboard and you are all set. Camera is fine - not too good, definitely not bad. Image stabilization is impressive! Face recognition is a nice add.One thing though. There was a heads up at one of the website that there will be price drop for mobiles between 3rd Jan - 6th Jan and I choose to ignore and buy straight away saying Amazon will cover. Tad disappointed with that, 1k dropped in 3 days.	5
19571	Display very light,screen width also small	2
19572	Picture quality is good sound quality is so good & battery life is very good if you not use net battery long live at list 2 day	5
19573	Long battery life	5
19574	Product given to me is average. Not worth purchasing. Inspite of 4gb ram phone hangs for some time.very disappointing. I don't know why Amazon sells such worst products. I have trust in Amazon services hope to see good service in future.	1
19575	Phone is pretty good but somethings its hangs.battery life is good full day backup camera is amazing al mode gives lovely pictures	4
19576	Battery is awesome.	5
19577	Superb quality of the most popular products	5
19578	Very nice phone but battery is bad performance	5
19579	"1. First thing i want to say about this phone is Battery. Battery backup is just unbelievable. I didn't expect this kind of ""battery performance"". till now this is the best mobile i have purchased.2. Second thing that i want to say abt this ph. is ""interface"". MIUI interface is very gud and convenience to use. no need and thirdparty apps for app locker. Everything will come within the handset. Especially hidden locker in file manager is awesome."	5
19580	All mi phones Super And excellent performances	4
19581	Everything 5 star. Go for it without doubt. Better than oppo and vivo	5
19582	High quality images it's look like pic taken from DSLR camera	5
19583	Redmi 6PRO is an excellent product. Battery gives more than 30 hours power.	5
19584	Great on clarity and ease of usage features. Not the biggest of screens but 18:9 feature covers all flaws, which are not many. Dolby, cast are missing  and if you are ready to sacrifice battery for host of other features, then think of buying it. As the manufacturer says, with Q6 to prolong battery, dont use while charging, there`s also minor heating issue if used during charging	4
19585	Very nice mobile phone mi redmi 6 pro	5
19586	Battery life is good , but it started getting hanged after two months of usage.	3
19587	Osm camera quality and battery.  Best phone at this price.	5
19588	Night selfy	4
19589	I brought this mobile with exchange and a big thanks to amazon for such a nice exchange value and fast delivery. The overall conclusion according to me is that this a good mobile in this price segment. But the one thing i missing that it's notification for most of the apps are not showing on lock screen and front camera is little bit average in low light, but after updating on miui 10 it's working nice. Back side dual camera is also incredible. Battery life is also very good.	4
19590	Camera stopped working and speaker output is very low. The notch is very annoying. Touch not working properly. Very worst phone that I had seen. Dont go with this mobile. Buy other brands like honor, Nokia or asus. They provide value for money.	1
19591	Mi A2 have only one issue is Poor battery backup.	5
19592	Useless phone.better to buy note 5 pro...  Or upcoming note 6pro..Ruuddiest bettry life. Ekdum faltu battery life he.	3

19615	It really appreciate 5 stars for Camera and battery life. Sound quality is also best ever at this price but bit less volume than any other honor mobile.	5
19616	I have been using honor 8X more than a month. My comments as below.1. Design - Really looks beautiful2. Camera - Packed with lot of features. I feel the portrait mode in rear camera not upto the mark compared to front portrait mode. Need improvement in rear camera portrait mode.3. Sound - By using earphone sound quality is really good, but phone speaker sound is very low. Need improvement in phone speaker sound quality.4. Speed - Really good, no hangover or lagging issues.5. Battery - Really good, solid 1.5 or 2 days with continuous data usage.6. Display - Really good7. Sim Slot - Dual Volte support, most anticipated features finally arrived especially for Jio users. Now you can switch data between both Sim. Both network will be active.8. Budget - Value for money.Recommended this model for customers searching below 15K budget. Trusted model to buy.	4
19617	Pictures quality is OK.not excellent.Otherwise very good phone	4
19618	Nice for the price	5
19619	Used the phone pretty good for people who don't use it much frequently .Bought it for my mom everything is good expect the heating when you talk on Skype and faced  problems with the facial unlcok process  so overall decent product but if you want better specs at the same price range or if you are hardcore phone addict think of something else . The build quality is good and display is exceptional .sound is pretty good too so buy this if you wanna gift it to your parents	4
19620	Exactly asexpected. Battery lasts only half a day if data and tethering switched on. Value for what we pay.	5
19621	Badly Heating dont purchase	1
19622	Awesome product..affordable price..Nice and decent display..	5

19624	Battery life was just average	5
19625	Awesome phone! I never thought that I will get wow! quality selfie by this phone. Nice camera quality and I love the others feature also. I thing one should go for LG Q6 instead of MI n others china smartphone.	5
19626	Very good n attractive.But havy games not supported.	4
19627	This phone is best in budget phones with all latest features like face detection and notch design.All other features are also par in their performance.	5
19628	Excellent support from Amazon.. Genune product..	5
19629	Phone is good, but hangs sometime completely	5

19631	Perfect budget phone....	5
19632	it has no 18:9 display...no dual camera...you can not take bokhe photo...front camera is also very bed..and it price is 17k...better to invest some more money and buy nokia 7 plus..in store it has 24k price..it has fabulous back and front camera with great bokhe mode. with greater processer and good bettary	1
19633	poor camera, battery, mobile is getting hot after using for 10 min.	1
19634	This is a nice production to purchase in a budget of 19000.......a bit heavy but ok....good for normal use	5
19635	I like the the rapid charging facility and good battery life of the moto G6.	4
19636	All is good but I dint got the proper bill inside my box	5
19637	Good phone under 20k but sometime camera lack in performance .	3
19638	Battery Backup : good backup. Fast charging and approx 10 hrs battery backup with 4g internet on.Problem : phone gets heated while charging.not sure why. There is no performance impact due to this.Camera : average.it could have been better.Phone hangs up when multiple apps opened simultaneously even if it has 4 gb of RAM	4
19639	Satisfied with the product so far.	4
19640	Good phone with good battery back up and good camera for the price	4
19641	Not Receive Invoice 👎	2
19642	If u can get over the no 3.5mm jack, then its a really good phone for the price. Great camera. Decent battery life. Sleek n sturdy	5
19643	Only two quality for which we can take this phone1)Single hand use2)Display ...The worst thing is now I am trying to play 1080P video there not playing properly ...	2
19644	Everything is just superb. All features ok only @ Rs. 12500/-.  Best value for money phone.	5
19645	Writing it after 1 week of use.Phone is slim and light weight, nicely build. Camera bump is big hence required a good case. Case provided in box catches fingerprints.Performance is decent can play pubg in medium or high settings. Phone heats up a bit while playing.Sound quality is awesome, flagship grade.Screen is good and camera is best in this segment till the vivo v11 pro. It's even better than pocco in low light.If you don't have Bluetooth headphones and your battery is low in between gameplay or while waching movie, you are lost :( you can either charge or listen it over headphone.No mocrosd card slot but internal storage is enough.Battery is not up to the mark. You need to find your charger in the evening. So if you are going for late night party then fill 3000mah battery first.Overall good phone except battery life  I got it for 10k with offers etc hence no complains HAPPY :)	4
19646	Phone lags like hell. While clicking photos it hangs. While playing game it hands. Very less sound also not good battery backup. Please dont buy it. Sold within 3 months. Bought 2 pieces at the same time and sold both.	1
19647	The worst phone ever can't even bare a small rain its water damaged and they don't even look what the problem	1
19648	It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud. Although having 3010 battery it's capable to last 5hours of use online and 10hours of offline use..Awesome phone 👌	4
19649	The product is fantastic with a premium look and heat issue while charging other than that every thing in the phone is perfect	5
19650	Excellent phone....first time Moto Experience# awesome	5
19651	Actually I have to give it 4.5 stars. First of all the delivery by Flipkart was amazing fast, within 48 hours I received my parcel. Talking about the packaging, it was fine but not up to the mark. Now talking about the box contents, the box include smart phone wrapped in plastic also including some paperwork a charger brick including a USB to micro USB cable. Also the box has an unexpected utility which is known as sound box according to Asus.               -Now talking about the handset, th...READ MORE	4
19652	Selfie Camera is  absolutely mind blowing. The phone is too sleek and gives a premium look.Everything is fine but battery back up is very poor.	5
19653	It's 18:9 full hd 442 ppi display itself is enough to kill other phones in the same or even up to 20k range phone of any brands. Best display. I am in love with it's display. It's touch is super buttery smooth. Phone size is exactly same as lenovo k5 power which is just 5inch display phone. So it is very very handy and can be used with one hand only. Very light weight .Other brands 5.5inch phone looks very very big when you keep side by side..Camera is more than satiafactory. You would get true colors from it's back camera. You have the option to choose the aspect ratio before click in any photo.Speaker is average not very good sound quality. Call quality is just awesome. I was using lenovo k5 note before this one. And a very huge difference in call quality.It has premium looks. I don't like playing games so can't comment on its game performance. But if you want to spend around 15k to 20k this is one of the best options available . Surly. Go for it.Update on 21st Sep...Feeling sad and disappointed to see the discount of 2000 today. It's even less than a month to purchase the same in 14999 now it is in 12999.  Amazon must think about this.Reducing one star in feedback...	4
19654	Product is good at this budget.Sexy look and field with a big screen. Picture don't have that much quality. Not at all a gaming mobile. Mobile is getting heated while playing game(PUBG) and watching 4k or 1080 HD video. Screen resolution is manageable but not good. Processing speed is also slow as compared to other mobile in this range.	3
19655	Hang problems	3
19656	I am totally disappointed..The mobile too slow and network issue	1

19658	Received this product today.13 mp camera is not good of this phone , manual setting missing , 5 mp front camera is not good.If you are going to buy this phone only for its screen then go for it otherwise this phone is not worth for rs. 14999 its actual price should be 11999 rs. As per its specs.	3
19659	It's a perfect mobile for me, it has everything I was looking in a budget handset.	5
19660	Good features, worth for money	5
19661	The phone looks great in hand and the screen is more vibrant and stunning look. The Camera brings good information on both front and rear camera.The sound is very sharp and clear.	5
19662	Camera quality could be better.	4
19663	Nice phone in the price range.	5
19664	I used only branded phones like and I already used LG optimus L9 p769 which was great so again I choose LG;Pros:Display looks awesome (bezel-free design and Full Vision exactly like G6);Premium design;Strong aluminum body, which is great;5.5 inch FHD (18:9) but easy to handle in one hand, light wight too;comfort view on night time read;Knock code lock/unlock;Memory: 3GB Ram and 32 GB ROM;Cons;Camera is not okay (what I feel) ;Snapdragon 435 is okay but 635 will be great for this price;Fingerprint sensor (but it is not issue for me).Additional notes:I got this on very big deal so i am happy with this phone. and it support 4GVOLTE, OTG, USB 2.0, Bluetooth 4.2.	4

19669	Compare to note 5 pro ..it's not good product by Xiaomi ...Planning to exchange with it note5 pro ...	2
19670	So far so good. I like the way it looks. In a market of increasingly expensive phones, this is a well priced phone with enough power and best style for any phone under 25k. Touch screen may have acted up a couple of times but I am not too sure of that being an issue with the phone or my touch yet.	5
19671	Made in india mobile set honor 8x doesn't meet the expectations as it has tiny scar on its back under glass panel and several times its lag to open multiple tasks simultaneously. Poor product sold by darshita i relpaced it twice but again got defected set third time also	1
19672	Not good... Worst camera... Can i give negative rating please?	1

19691	THE DEAL THAT I GOT:I was previously using Xiaomi Mi A1. Given the fact that I love pure Android more than any skinned UI I had always preferred AndroidOne devices. On Great Indian Festival I got a great deal from Amazon. My Mi A1 which I had purchased more than a year ago was valued at Rs 5501 under exchange program. Also, Mi A2 was available only for 14999 Rs. This effectively brought Mi A2's price to 9498 Rs. Also, the no cost EMI for 9 months was cherry on the top.I'm very happy with this upgrade from Mi A1 to Mi A2.NOW THE PHONE REVIEW:Everything about this phone is much better that Mi A1.CAMERA: Camera has impressed me the most. It has much better Camera than Zenfone Max M1 Pro (Which my dad is using). The low light photos and selfies are of very high quality. Portrait mode in outdoor condition is much-much better. But in a hermit cave like, my room, it doesn't fair much in small and dark place. Still better than what the competitors are offering. Only complain is that you can't take very close macro shots.Sound: Loud... much louder than my Mi A1 (ofc that's what I have used so I'll compare to that). But there is a little vibration on the phone body when it is in full volume, like sound echoes inside the phone.Build: Great. Light and very premium feel.UI: Better than most of the skinned phones. Plus a couple of tweaks like Rootless launcher and Graby Skin icons makes phone look beautiful. Fast and fluid.Performance: Coming from SD 625, I have not pushed the limits of this one yet. I do not game much. but yeah,SD 660 is definitely much better that the SD 625.Battery: Wanted more but its okay for a normal user like me. I was a power user but nowadays I do most of my stuff on my laptop. Though QuickCharge make up for it. I already own a fast charger.SCREEN: Really great. Colors are not looking very vibrant like AMOLED but it is a LTPS IPS which consumes less energy than normal IPS... Doesn't come with a NOTCH. Even if it had I had that notch disabled. Only thing I hate is the big chin, still better than what I was using. right?NO HEADPHONE JACK. Seriously... Now that, even Mi A2 don't have a headphone jack, think of future.. Only budget phones will have it. So I thought of making this compromise. Others are offering it but sooner or later it'll be gone. So BETTER ADOPT EARLIER THAN LATER. It has a USB C to 3.5 mm adapter included in the box. Doesn't make it any easier but at least we can use a 3.5mm headphones. Keep that little dongle safely.Lets break it down....THE GOOD:1. Android One (personal preference, faster updates guaranteed though, enhanced battery life and less bloats)2. Aluminium Build (Better than fake glass)3. Good Camera, better low light performance.(20MP+12MP & 20MP selfie Camera!)4. Quick Charge.5. Slim Profile (7.3mm)6. Selfie Flash for selfie lovers.The BAD:1. Bigger top and bottom bezels (Forehead and Chin)2. No macro shot3. Smaller battery (3000 mAH)4. No microSD slot (Personal preference, 64GB is Enough for me though)5. Price (17K doesn't justify the battery and bezel size)Overall, It was better upgrade for me. If I had sold Mi A1 separately, I would have got only 6.5k... not much difference and saved from headache of dealing with people.If Mi A2 is not on offer then please do consider other options. It was a better deal for me then.	5

19710	Excellent product for this price. I am using it for the past couple of days. No over heating or hanging experienced. Camera quantity is also good. Only problem I feel is for the loud speaker. Loud speaker Sound quality is low.	5
19711	very disappointed even my Moto G5 plus is more.better then this cell have lots of Moto actions in g5plus . battery is also okay okay not so damn good ... those who have Moto G5 G5plus G5s plus don't buy Moto android one .READ MORE	1
19712	"Like : 1.  Camera  (Sharp Photos  & Videos)  2.  Battery  3.  Browsing Experience  (Very Smooth)  4.  Music (Sound Quality)Dislike  :  Height could have shortened to 5.4  or 5.5 ""."	5
19713	This is just my second day with this phone. I am kind of liking and hating it at the same time. Reasons for liking is the display quality and user experience of this phone, which is quite good. The part that i am not liking is that all the apps are not able to take the benefit of full vision display amd they take their own boxy display window. Only place where i can use full screen display is while watching YouTube videos. Sound quality on loid speaker is not very good as the speaker ia placed at the back side and that too is a single speaker.. So no dolby sound while watching video on loudspeaker.. However quality of the earphone speaker which comes with the box is very good.. Loud and clear... Also, the worst part is that the face recognition feature does not work quite well.. I have improved the face recognition many times at multiple lighting condition and it just does not work sometimes. So if you buy it, please dont try to boast this feature in front of your friends otherwise it may be a turn down. I am hoping that this feature should start working better as days pass by... I will keep on training it each day in this hope :) ... overall, i would say it is a good phone considering the user experience and the brand... And that reminds me.. Servicing of LG phpnes is also very good and cheap.. My previous phone was also an LG and one of the reason behind me buying this phone ia also the service experience that i got on my previous phone. So good job there LG.	4

19738	front display is ok, but back is worst, camera is worst. phone started hitting.nothing is good in it except front look & display.i suggest do not buy, you will have better option in this range.	2
19739	Battery performance slower then every month	5
19740	Had to get it formatted due to some sound issue.	3
19741	I played a tech video on youtube in 1080p and when I see the text in the video which is shown in mobile is not clear and it is like blurred text even in 1080p and then I played the next video the small text is not readable and like blurred. I think it because it has low Pixels per inch (PPI) acc. to display size. And also sound quality is low as it has a single speaker but realme 2 pro has also a single speaker and it has good and loud sound than honor 8x.	2
19742	Same like note 4	4
19743	Mobile is too good..... Bt in summer month heating issue	4

19756	Dont purchase this phone....Got 2 updates,Heating reduced,Camera quality is NOT good,Keeps on fluctuating volte on and off, no option to turn it on so u cant place a call on jio when volte is off. Only option to turn it back on is a reboot.	3
19757	Worth the price, some negative reviews created a doubt. I am happy with the overall quality.  Ordered last evening and received it today. Great job.	5
19758	Very bad performance and behavior of customer care also too bad. Its heating too much while doing anything on phone. Thisis the second one that i got faulty device. Now amazon is ridiculous. No support like thay did in past years.	1
19759	Kind of premium phone.best in camera best in look just loved it	5
19760	Display is so gud	5
19761	Despite having dual camera, picture quality is below average. Notification not visible directly on screen, you need to drag down the screen to see the notifications. Screen display is not at par with phone in this range.	3
19762	Buy ASAP!!!!!	5
19763	Loss of money, bad backup of battery	1
19764	Front camera quality is not good. Otherwise it makes a style statement. Screen is the best part in all measures. Must buy, if usage isn not heavy.	4
19765	1st Android based phone I got in 2010 i.e. Samsung Galaxy 3 (Eclair 2.1 OS) and after using it till 2012 end, tried for other brands till 2018 until I got this on8 (2018). The software interface (Samsung Experience) just outperforms Samsung Touchwiz and other top on skin from other manufacturers.

19779	The most worst ever camera i've seen. I've cleared all filters and all settings.But still i see the difference in colors. Yellow turns to green, red turns to orange....  Highly dissappointed.	1

19785	Heating problem on extensive use. Charging is very slow. These are major problems in phone but apart from it there are no issues in phone and rest it has killer looks that will bring temptation to even iphone user. Surfing is smooth. Camera is good and sound is loud..value for money as LG brand is involved and its indian made product.	4

19804	Good look with better battery, camera, and features. Lasting battery for 18 hrs with 4g data on, and more than 24 hrs in wifi browsing. Speaker sound is better than old versions.	5
19805	Phone is getting hanged. Started facing issues with the phone within 7 days of purchase like the microphone doesn't work, while on call can't hear the other ends voice properly.	2
19806	Excellent device for this budget, can easily compete with the mi a2 in terms of ram management. There's a setting which allows you to customize your ram management. After that the ram management is even better than the so speculated  mi a2.  Battery backup is excellent, can stand a whole day with a single charge. Charges quickly too, took me 30 mins roughly to take it from 50-100%. The hisilicon kirin 710 is even better than the sd 660, so stop comparing with the benchmarkscores. The camera is also quite good, although the mi a2 has an advantage in this segment. The sound quality is okay-ish, not that great, but at the price point it's totally negotiable. If you're someone much into launcher apps, then emui is definitely the ui skin for you. The ample choices of themes on the play store make it a pleasant experience to use the emui. The backshooter 20mp+2mp combo could have been improved, and there are a bit problems with the camera performance, but hopefully they'll be fixed in the next software update. On security backgrounds, the fingerprint scanner is one of the fastest I've ever used, in this budget range, also the face scanning is slightly a bit buggy as it tends to unlock even when you're not looking at it. Face if works in lowlight conditions too, but not in pitch darkness. Overall I'd say this is THE smartphone to go for in this budget range.	5
19807	Good decent phone	5
19808	Too bad mobile for every thing	1

There was also offer in terms of scrren replacment freely within a year. All good about mobile. Except no 2 4g slim slots. Asus pro has. Battery life is 4000 mah whereas asus pro provides 5000mah. Asus provides 6gb ram whereas this is only 4gb ram.	4
19818	Excessive heating while charging...Compared the camera with others.. it seems to be a bit dull..but looks natural..needs to be enhanced using Zeiss optics	4

19835	On 17 July 2018, I purchased a Samsung Galaxy J8 mobile phone on Amazon.in as it is a dual sim phone built with new technology and looked promising considering the features and upgrades.However, within 2 months of purchase, the phone started malfunctioning. On my visit to the service centre, I was informed by the Customer Service Executive that the hardware of the phone has malfunctioned and the same needs to be repaired. I was shocked to find that a mobile phone which is worth Rs. 18,000-20,000 malfunctioned within 2 months of purchase. I told them that I don''t want my phone to be opened up and repaired within 2 months of purchase and requested them for replacement with a new device. The customer service executive informed me that I will have to speak to the Customer Care if I want a replacement. Accordingly, I called the Customer Care and explained the whole situation to them. The customer care informed me that they will escalate the matter, however, they cannot commit a replacement. As directed by the Customer Care, I submitted my phone with the Service Centre and a job sheet was created for my phone.Simultaneously, I also wrote a mail to the CEO Desk explaining the whole situation and demanding a replacement of the phone as it had malfunctioned within 2 months of purchase and the same was solely attributable to manufacturing. The representative from the CEO Desk called and denied any kind of replacement in the name of policies and asked me to accept the repair offer or they will return the phone as it is. I was forced to accept the repair offer as I had no other choice. The company was adamant and insensitive towards the problem being faced by a customer in the name of policies. I am sure no customer would want his mobile phone which is worth Rs. 20,000 to be opened up like a can of beans within 2 months of purchase.I am completely shocked and devastated by the adamant and insensitive behavior of SAMSUNG and that too when the malfunctioning of the phone is solely attributable to their manufacturing. If I had known that their mobile phone will perform so badly and I will have to face such problems with Samsung then I would have rather purchased device of some other company. I am really very unhappy and dissatisfied with the whole experience and will think thousand times before buying any samsung product next time.	1
19836	I loved the build and screen quality. Battery is upto the mark it gives 12-14hrs of life for heavy use.Camera Loved it specially AI feature.	5

19846	Moto G6 is an amazing phone. Amazon provided amazing deals for this phone. SD 450 might seem inferior, but no performance issues are seen. Turbo Charge is fantastic. The build quality is solid and sleek. Feels cozy to hold. The camera is fantastic for this price point. AI enabled photography is also a marvel. Low light photography is also good. Motorola has integrated this phone efficiently with 4gb RAM and 64GB hard disk space. The UI is also outstanding with lots of gesture based features and shortcuts. The earphones provided too are of great quality.  Well done Moto !	5
19847	Excellent phone with great battery life and excellent camera at this price point	5

19860	Loving this phoneOnly drawbacks are battery and 3.5mm jack missing	5
19861	After going through the reviews i was initially  hesitant to buy this phone but finally decided to buy it. After using it for four days i am feeling very happy with my decission. Yes a little heating problem do exists but i can assure that after using it for few days you will no longer experience it as the battery stabilizes. The design, look, performance, built in quality is just awesome. You will get the feeling of using a premium mobile phone with this affordable one.	5
19862	It does not contain multy keyboard	5

19865	Best phone in this prize range best move by LGI am really satisfied with this	5
19866	This device is better than other chinese products. build quality, hardware and softwares are even good. battery backup is even better. i gave 4 star instead of 5 star because of it should have atleast notification led light sensor and quick charging option as well. face unlock is little slow but it doesn't open the device when your eyes would  be close so it is more secure than one plus oppo vivo mi and other chinese devices.READ MORE	4
19867	Ist buy of honor brand but little disappointed after purchase as sound quality is not that good and video quality also not so cool...only battery life n processor is good....camera quality in low light also not that great....at this price range Samsung phones are much better than this..	3

Do not sell this product in your portal.	1

19877	Super Display and all the latest features.Its not over heating as many users reviewed its super cool.Hold this phone once you will definitely buy.	5
19878	Oh my God..!!! What a mobile.. Believe me or not after i purchased 4 people next to bought the same. We have became LG family. No need to explain the features and Performance.	5
19879	Looking super super battery super displarBad notch management in apps soo many bugs in software prefer honor 8x vary disappointed camera the front cam too much disappointing	5
19880	Phone is looking good. Build quality is descent. Battery lasts for a day with moderate use and no games. Display is crisp. Not facing any over heating problem. Size is well suited for keeping in the shirt pocket. Updated to the latest firmware. No message about Oreo yet. Photo quality of the rear camera is above average. Charging time from around 10%  to full charge is around 2 hours. Don't buy this phone with great expectations. If you are a moderate user (particularly internet) and use it more for phone calls, this is a good option. LG should have focused more on battery (or battery management) because there are several other phones with 3000MAh battery with descent back up time with relatively heavy use!!!	3

19921	I am satisfied with the looks,screen display and mostly all the features LG has given in this phone.It's easy to carry & light in weight,finish is awesome but the major disappointment is the sound quality.Its pathetic.Not a good option if you are expecting a crisp & loud sound	4
19922	Decent purchase.but but costly	4
19923	Even though if it is having 24MP front camera, it makes a dull and dark room into a white and bright room, along with our face. So you can imagine while taking selfies. It gets a bit stuck sometimes. It's user friendly. Cute small phone, not bulky can do one hand operations as well	4
19924	Good build quality...dedicated microSD card slot...Vivid display...Very good battery life..	4
19925	Picture quality is good.amazing battery life.. Luv d it... Overall nice.. also it reminds me of iphone..	5
19926	Awesome look...Best phone in low budget 2017.....full amoled dislplay with fingerprint scanner	5
19927	I have purchased better product Redmi Note 5 Pro in Low price from flipkart. It's picture quality is better then Redmond 6 Pro	2
19928	Calling is very problematic and in one time you can't hear nothing so firstly you disconnect call every time than you hear voices.	3
19929	Nice phone means good	5
19930	Dont buy if you want photography. Though carl Zeiss lens but camera not that good. The Quick Charge gives a good experience. Stock android so no lag. Dont worry it does gets heated as body is aluminium while charging.	4

19933	Battery is discharge with in 1 hr if play olny online musicIf you getting only jack issue then they change motherboard and charge 75% of mobile price.	1
19934	Everything okay....bt camera not good	4
19935	Guys don't go for it. Waste of Money. Infact basic functons are missing	1
19936	Light weight and handy but gets highly heated during video calls.	3
19937	picture quality is great, and battery life is just awesome after pie update. The phone is a gem for it's android one and camera features. The only drawback is absence of a headphone jack but you can get used to it, no big deal. Go for the 6gb ram version, else 4gb is fine too.	5
19938	Everytime  After unlocking the phone , when user selects the mobile data shortcut icon from the top icons bar then nothing happens no datatransfer happens, But when user restarts the mobile then only mobile data gets switched on	2

19944	Good battery and phone as per price	5
19945	Ok my 1 week usage review.1. This mobile not for photography lovers, camera is worst beyond you can think of.2. Battery pretty nice backup with normal usage excluding games.3. Touch screen 10/10.4. Looks/style totally premium from sides, but plastic body on back.5. Call voice quality 8/106. Charging time 2-3 hours with mobile original charger.7. UI very comfortable for usage.8. Till now regular updates coming.9. Comfortable in hands, no bulky size.10. No heating issue faced yet, in start there was heating issue for 1-2 days, but gradually it vanished.Conclusion : You can buy this phone if you looking for budget phone with latest android updates and new 18:9 display feature.	3
19946	This phone screen is just too long. Aspect Ratio 19:9 is just not Adjustable	4
19947	Great to have. Nice look	5
19948	Don't buy...there are better phones in the market	1
19949	It's really good..!!	4
19950	If you are looking for performance this is the good product to go for...If you are looking for fancy features then a lot other phones available in market	4
19951	Slim design 👌	4
19952	No point to dislike	4
19953	Notch display is super but i dont like its portrait mode	5
19954	Video quality of this phone is worst blurry video quality and front camera is worst	2
19955	Marvellous phone with Amazing Features !	5
19956	Selfie camera is not good.It should be much better.	4
19957	Redmi 6 pro doesn't have option to show stats bar icons.and front camera quality is not good.A phone without status bar icon is complete useless I think.And it's notch is also useless. Disappointed with the product..	1
19958	The only thing is it's thickness	5
19959	Okay!! I've been using this phone for the past 1 month and I am satisfied with the performance of its ai camera battery life and screen display!! The fone is good looking and it provides a good screen to body ratio which enhance its looks!! But if u r looking for gaming purpose then I am pretty sure it's gonna disappoint you! Ive been playing pubg and pess for the last month and initially I was so happy with the performance.. But after some days I noticed the fone was having some heating issue when I was playing pubg(not top graphics) another defect I found was once my fone got hang after a continues use of 3 hrs!! I was watching a movie and as soon as I kept my fone for charging everything came to a halt and It lasted for some 10 mins!! That was something I didn't expect!! So if u r looking for a fone with good looks or good screen and good camera!! It's the best for u and at the same time if u r looking for  a gaming experience the its btr u shud try some other fone	3
19960	Better to buy “Samsung On8” which is same as “Samsung J8” and have lees price tag. The display is not worth the price tag!	4
19961	best phone at this range.bought it for my father...so satisfied with deal n battery backup is awesome	5
19962	Fully satisfied with thisGo for it	5
19963	awesome camera phone..	5
19964	Ordered this beautiful phone. everything was as i expected for a 15k phone until i turn on and a started using the phone. The phone started producing so much heat on the left side of the phone around the volume rockers on the metal frame. i almost panicked but thought it was normal because im using it for the first time and there was a lot of things going on in the background and it will go away. But it still heats up even on normal usage and it heats up beyond the comfort level when running multiple apps.Im not sure if this is a problem with the unit i got. i just hope LG roll out some ota update to fix the heating issue if this an issue faced by most users.I just got it and dont want to bother myself visiting the service centre.Btw.. The front cam is pathetic and back camera is average.Other than the above mentioned issues and the not so great camera, i would say its a fairly good device overall especially for those who want a beautiful phone on a budget.Im giving only three stars because i deduct 1* for camera and another for the heating issue.	3
19965	It's too good with features. Battery Back up is also good .	4
19966	I bought this for my colleague. According to there response this phone is very good in use. As this is a Android One project, there are not any buggy applications pre loaded apps. So it is very easy to operate and the best thing is its camera which gives a popping result.	4
19967	Supperb, i Find no any type of heating issue with this phone.battery backup also good. First day it was heating but after updating sw it running normal.look is cool.Only problem with mobile screen mirror not supported otherwise mobile is superb.	5
19968	I was using Lenovo A 536 for more than 4 years, I recently switched to this phone. In just one week the metal at back of it has scratches.I didn't used any harsh thing. It is just because of dust particles. My old phone still has no scratch on it.It heats up very quickly if you are making phone calls or even listening to the music.	1
19969	Camera isn't very good in artificial lighting condition... Speaker is bismal..	4
19970	MI A2mobile  bad , battery backup to bad, I do not get good response from Flipcard,Calibration Networking In The Mobile Bad,mi A2mobile hitting issues,airphone issues.         my issues not resolved plsREAD MORE	1

19972	not recommended..	1
19973	I need the bill	5
19974	No heating even playing high graphic quality games awesome battery backup	5
19975	Today suddenly the phone got dead and it was not getting switched on or even I tried to put it on charge but of no use. I have bought it 15 days back. Battery is not that good but overall it's fair.	3
19976	It's been almost 3 months since I've been using this phone, and it's held up good so far.If you're looking for a phone that'll make heads turn (w/o having a case on), you're looking at the perfect choice. The back of the phone looks absolutely insane.With regards to the build quality, the phone feels premium to use - glass and metal sandwich. At the same time it makes the phone way fragile. So in order to protect your phone really well you should either go for a armoured case or opt for having a decent tempered glass on both the sides.With regards to performance, the phone has a SD 450 chipset. For all those saying, a 400-series is for entry level phones - one clarification SD 450 is built on the same process as the older mid ranger SD 625 and even has the same GPU just it has a bit lower clock speed of 1.8 GHz vs the 2.0 GHz on 625. In day to day tasks like streaming YouTube or browsing the Internet or Social Media this phone is a breeze.Please note: the phone isn't suitable for heavy Gaming - even games like Asphalt 9 or PUPG will stutter leaving you with a sense of frustration.The phone also offers a front firing speaker tuned by Dolby and it is one of the plus points this phone has.About the cameras all I've to say is that they're decent. The portrait mode is a hit or miss with rear camera and the white balance isn't accurate. You'll have to wait to time your shot properly. In low light don't even expect this phone will perform good. Selfies are good - the added selfie portrait mode get the job done to a certain extent.The manual mode does allow you to tweak the controls a bit.One thing I've observed with the camera is that the manual mode on auto settings takes photos faster as compared to normal auto settings.The battery backup is good. One full charge gets me through the day easily and turbo charger is the cherry on the cake. It's refreshing to see manufacturers adopting USB Type-C in this price segment.And finally software is where you'll have to think twice before getting the phone. The software experience is just as moto like. Least bloatware - more useful features (chop chop for flashlight and double twist for camera, one button navigation). If you're coming from the earlier generation of Moto Phones you won't have any issues getting used to this one. But unlike the earlier generations under Google, the Motorola under Lenovo is a bit behind with regards to Android OS updates. (Many moto G5 series phones started receiving Android Oreo when most of the phone were getting Android Pie updates -_-) Thought Moto G6 is supported by Android Treble program, it'll receive security updates once in 60-90 day span as against other counterparts with received monthly security updates. So if software is your priority then you should really prefer the Android One offerings in the same price range.Now lastly the price, i bought the phone @ Rs. 16k and the phone is already currently selling for Rs. 14k. That's a great depreciation in price in just a period of 4 months since initial release. Further to add salt on wounds, there's absolutely no resale value on this. Amazon India has listed a resale value of Rs. 3,900 and it's competitors have listed around Rs. 5,200. If you're expecting that after a year or two down the line you'll be able to get a good exchange price against your next upgrade then forget it. So may be in the end it'll become one of your backup devices or a simple secondary device for calls and texts.	3

19993	This phone is waste of money, better to go with Realme U1 or Mi phones even Nokia 6.1 plus. Worst camera and sound of the phone.	1
19994	Hopeless Phone with worst coustemer care support.Display was damaged but the company people asking 12000Rs for new display.Dose it make sense that we should pay 12000Rs for display for 14000Rs phone.I think the worst decision i took to buy this phone. Now i will Definitely switch to other brand.	1
19995	Low price, good specs. I bought this one just as something I would pass on to my siblings, after I bought the OnePlus 6T on launch. This phone is such a beauty, and smooth, I got second thoughts on buying OnePlus 6T. I think I'll buy another of this one instead.Movies, games, pics all are smooth.If you would want me to force out a con, it is just a little slippery mobile, so careful all glass. And would want that pattern lock back!	5

But some problems I faced were the stabilization spring in the camera makes a little sound while you place it on a table.although the product is awesome and the 3.5mm headphone jack adapted is good	5

20035	really interesting and time killer	5
20036	Has heating issues . Otherwise a good phone	4
20037	The phone heats up like hell. I tried to place return but the option doesn't work. It shows error. I did contact customer service, they either explain me the process of how to place the return or they say they will fox the issue within 48hours. Firstly if I could place the return by myself I wouldn't have complained about the return option not working! I have eyes, I can see the written option and I can follow the procedure!! And finally if you fix the return option error after 48hrs, I can't place the return 'coz I have only 12 hours left to do that. Today is the last date for placing return.Coming to performance of the phone apart from the heating issue,*network issues. Once in a while the network goes is both the sims and comes back. It's a big issue while making payments online.*The rear camera takes normal quality pictures inspite of having 13mp camera.*front camera is worst.*can't play games for a longer duration. It lags a lot.*can't stream videos for a longer duration due to heating issue.*charge lasts for only half a day.*doesn't charge fast even with turbo chargers.My final advice to everyone is never buy mobile phones from amazon.	1

20048	Honor 8x is a good device.Pro's:1. Design and build quality is great.Feels premium in hand.But back glass can break so be careful.Front glass is stronger than the back glass.2.Performance is good.Kirin 710 can match up with Snapdragon 660 with cpu.No lags.3.Display quality is good.Good viewing angles and good colour reproduction.It is not so big as the screen is fitted as like a 5.5 inch.4. Camera is ok.Honor needs to improve camera.Outdoor conditions it is great.Low light conditions it is little bit struggling but can be sought by night mode which is good.5. EMUI gives u lot of options.We can hide the notch,so many battery Saving modes.6.Battery is good for 6.5 inch screen.I am getting one day battery life on a heavy usage.8hrs+ screen on time.So many Saving options available so no need to worry about battery life.7.Gaming is good.I am not a hard-core gamer but plays pubg at medium graphic settings.But one can enjoy the gaming as the screen is big and battery is also good.Con's:1.Charging time.It takes 2hrs 35 minutes to charge the device.No fast charging.No USB Type-C that is sad.2.Selfies are over sharpening the image some times.Software update is needed.3.It is bulky than the Redmi note 5 pro.4.Back glass will break in few drops.5.Sound quality is not bad not good it's average.While using headphones we need to keep the volume at max.This phone is from trusted brand Huawei.I changed this from Redmi note 5 pro. This device is for who likes big display, good battery,good build quality.Thank you;-)	4
20049	Camera not expected lije this by Mi very poor Quality	4
20050	Amazon delivery is superb, but mobile looks and earphones is very bad	5
20051	This is the best phone under 15000 with full vision display .It has metal at sides which makes it premium , dont go for other reviews , let them love plastic micromax .Camera is excellent , battery could have been better but it will last throughout the day with moderate use .I personally like LG's attempt on mid range device .	5
20052	I have been a consistent use of Motorola phones but i don't recommend Moto coz Moto G6 processor isn't good phone's processing is very slow after a month only. I broke the back glass so went to get it repair but did get the same colour indigo Black n it's been two months I am still carrying broken glass coz they don't have the same colour glass which is in new phone... In my opinion don't buy Moto product coz service has been very disappointing.	3
20053	Good Phone, Most important aspect is the size of 5.5 inch but easy fit in small pocket.	4
20054	Awesomely working	5
20055	I M happy	5
20056	Overall Performance is best...	5
20057	Ok ok at this price. Phone is bulky.	4
20058	Good picture quality and sound..	3
20059	Nice mobile phone.. excellent sound quality, camera is awesome,thank you to Amazon for this product I love it..	5
20060	Using Q6 for over one month now. Look wise its the most beautiful Android budget phone with 18:9 screen display which just adds on to its beauty.It used to heat a bit initially but after the Software update its giving decent performance.When you record a video or click a picture and then view on this beautiful display, it looks amazing.I saw redmi mix which packs bezel less display, But if you think that the company should be there with you even after the purchase , in case any issue comes in device or any support is needed , then without a second thought you should go for LG Q6. They do have good customer support.	5
20061	Mobile was good.. quality pictures and sound and speed... But only one problem it's too sensitive in touch screen .. when ever received the call ...it's connecting one more call from dial list or mute or the call.. it's little bit disappointed.. when ever receive call or out going call we have to give high concentration on touch screen.

Not much into canera thing.Face unlock n fingerprint sensor works like charm... Face unlock even works in complete dark only if u keep high brightness.Cons:Audio via headphone jack is low I mean very low.Display quality is okaish if not the best......All in all this phone is worth its price... Dont expect fast charging or wireless charging in this price range... It's not a deal breaker...	5
20122	Perfect Budget phone	5
20123	I use almost 2 months.No hang. Good perfomance. Battery backup avg. Camera Good. Gaming good. And Display is awsome. But Heating problem	5
20124	handset bahut achha hai lightweight Hai battery bahut acchi hai aur camera to awesome hai	5
20125	No portrait for selfies	4
20126	Display is just amazing ..Sound is Loud.. Camera quality is Very good in daylight but it has to struggle in Night or Low light. Portrait mode works flawlessly. PUBG works but u will feel some Lags as processor is 625 SD .Miui 10 is now available for this phone!!I got it for ₹9999 plus ₹1000 cashback so my effective price was just 8999₹ with screen Replacement guarantee for one time (During Diwali sale)	5
20127	Excellent music experience with Dolby. Nice camera - front and rear. Battery life lasting for a full day and night, is good with turbo power charger . Worth it. Stylish looking phone. You will not be disappointed. Go for 64gb internal memory. Face recognition is good. Other multiple small features _ call blocking, message prompt for calls which did not get answered, clear all application.	5
20128	Lg is Best. Performance asks design quality o is awesome. I really love it. I don't want apple any more. We become lg family after using this phone. All lg design products are good. Worth to buy.  Face recougnisation is working well, compactness making feel good for handling, sim selection option is flexible, clarity is good, battery callousl capacity is less conspir compare to other smart phones, but giving back up for whole day enjoying. lg has designed this phone really, not like other manufacturers rg moto simply assembling it and giving for seekin selling.	5
20129	Awesome look. Such an amazing product from MI. Please try it once. Specially display is awesome.	5
20130	charging issue	3
20131	Nice product but picture quality is low	4
20132	please do not buy this phone. It simply overheats too much specially during video calls. It gets heated up so much that one point I thought it will catch fire. I couldn't hold it in my hand literally. The same issue is there while calling too and you will get headache because of that.On top of this, phone is very very slow. It can't handle normal browsing. Completely useless product by lg. If you can't use this phone for basic things like calling and browsing then what use keeping this phone.On top of this, amazon is not accepting return. They say install smart check app and then based on the results they will accept. When I tried the app, it shows battery temperature as 40 and accepted level is supposed to be < 48. I think that smart check app is smartly developed in order to make it impossible to return this pathetic device.I have shopped so much in amazon. This is one of the worst. My sincer request to anyone looking at this device. Don't spend your money on this and regret later.Don't even worth single star cheater amazon n worst lg service worst product worst reply by Amazon customer care n lg care to stupid replies tey all want the phone should blast then only return is possible.	1
20133	Awesome feeling when I was using its better than Big Big display mobile and looks so sexy mobile...	5
20134	mi never provide extend warranty,hey?	4
20135	Nice phone in full vision display	5
20136	Best phone in this price segment	5
20137	I order this phone for my mother.. as I have already used redmi note 5 pro... But note 6 pro is totally a wastage of money.. sound quality is not so loud like note 5pro.. and the camera i.e the picture quality is blackish... So it's a worst phone .	1
20138	Hi.. i am using this phone for last 2 month. I would like to share some of real reviews about this phone.Before this phone i was using moto g4 play. I decided to swith to a new phone as i am working in it company. I need a good phone that can help me out with my multiple task. But my budget was around 15k -19k. I took a decision to go with MI A2.Good thing-- having a advantage of google stock phone, less inbuilt application. Good performance due it.- it is very sleek phone..you will love to keep this phone in hand as compare other brand phone.- good bettery life. Perform really well- screen display quality is good.- camera quality is goodNegative Thing -- i am really very disappointed with the music output in earphone by this phone. Headphone lover will not like it. Some i have to use my old phone Motorola for music satisfaction. Amazing sound output quality in moto phone.- You will feel bad when you want to listen music in this phone and you missed 3.5 mm connecting pin because this phone not having dedicated 3.5 mm jack.- camera is not as good as it should be in low light. It some time click blur images in low light.Overall i give 8/10 in this budget range. But highly recommend to them who do not want to spend more money. Bettery and look is best in this class.Thanks	3
20139	This product is very nice..... battery level is too good.	4
20140	I bought this phone at 14990 with 10% amazon pay cashbackThis phone is awesome at this price everything thing is faster smother and better	5
20141	no words about phone except battery 3010 mah	5
20142	A very nice and super phone	5
20143	Got it for 6400 after exchanging it with my samsung ..it is too good for 6400 with that quality display and build quality but if you consider it buying for 15k..better go for moto or nokia 6	4
20144	good for home purpose use,not for gaming	5
20145	Super handly phone and display resolution clarity is Super	5
20146	Quality of camera not good if we compare with camera MP size	3
20147	Camera is wrost camera ever seen. I think they are just only labelling that front camere 16 mp and rear camera 20+2 mp.I have 10 or E smartphone which camera is 5 mp front and 13 mp is back but u know what my 10 or E camera is much better than honor 8x.10 or E providing me good details in picture looking original and honor 8x 0 (zero) detailing had and very bad color effect.Other thing is nice looking very premium and procesure also nice.	2
20148	Best mid range smartphone	4

20154	I Simply love it	5
20155	best price and advanced features	5
20156	Good handy feeling with superb features	5
20157	* I wish the screen width was more, first time looking at it feels like a small phone, even though my last phone was an LG Optimus G with a 4.4 inch screen, but nevermind, it looks pretty.* The back is a scratch magnet.* Battery drains quite fast.* LG UI is satisfactory in aesthetics, functionality and lagfree.* Certainly not for graphic intensive games. Even Clash of Clans lags.* Sound quality from the headphone jack is satisfactory.* Ringtone from speakers are too quiet and unreliable in loud scenarios.* Camera is good both for stills and video.* Overall I'd say its way overpriced, I'll stick to my MI MAX (2016).Thanks	3
20158	Mobile Continue use in mobile hitting issue....No Battery life morning to evening poor bad condition battery Life...Any way Faster mobile...	3

20213	Camera quality is poor.. Primary camera doesn't excepted..	3
20214	Camera quality is best at day and night pure view camera with Sony sensor and look is very elegant natural photography no warmness in photo quality performance is excellent it beat all other phones realme oppo and samsung	5
20215	Device is perfect to handle in one hand. Obviously need to use two hand while typing.	5
20216	With s435, no fingerprint reader, poor speaker n that too mounted on back, average software optimization, average camera; I would say its just overpriced. Just for giving 18:9 won't mean LG should charge 15k for this. There's shortage of option in 18:9 segment n therefore lg is trying to earn big margin here. Go for other option.	2
20217	for 13k price range this phone is a nice deal, but not up to the mark as claimed by manufacturer.Pros:rich look, faster performance, very impressive bright display, price range.Cons:both front and rear camera are complete disaster, very disappointed with camera, face unlock doesn't work proper in low light, no front flash, no gorilla glass, Mi remote doesn't work properly.Overall its okay.	3
20218	I bought this device on release date itself im loving it i just want to say cons bcoz it has lot of prosCons: rear camera should improve a little bit it produces over saturation images and their is no eis i hope they will fix that via ota update	4
20219	This product is good but earphone is not available for this phone	5

20246	Your review should focus on specific features of the product and your experience with it. For video reviews, we recommend that you write a brief introduction.	5
20247	I am using for the last one week with JIO sim. Network issue and heating problem. I called the customer care of LG people they are telling nicely its a problem of network not mobile. After discussion of LG customercare people I have tried in IDEA network also. Same problem i am facing. Other things are ok.	2

20252	Ya its display is very impressive. Looking good and features allso good . batry also  good.	5
20253	Phone look and features are good but sound quality need improvement	4
20254	Sound of the phone is quite inferior than other phones in the segment. My lumia 535 gives a better output. Not sure if Huawei will give an update. I would have liked to give a negative mark to it but it has just got stars in the review for sound.	3
20255	Very slow phon previously i m using redmi 3s prime that was faster than this.Taking too much time for open camera and cliking the photos . They are saying it is advanced processor but its is very slow same UI not geting miui 10.Please dnt buy. Mu suggestions is to buy redmi 6 price lower than this.Camera so bad they are showing dual camera but clearity is worst in low light.	3
20256	Really nice phone to useCamera is quite goodThough battery is not as much but I recommend this phone to everyone.	5
20257	Amazing camera quality. Processes faster without any lag. Very strong phone. Recent update has added cool features like dts:x audio the android version has been updated to oreo. Very good phone just the battery life is less.	4
20258	Nice Phone by RedmeNothing say much about phone just best in all Manner fully upgraded specifications.	5
20259	The processing is sometimes too slow. Overall good produxt	4
20260	Amazing phone it's totally a value for money product. Totally premium in looks and also in features. Talking about the camera, AI is totally awesome. Even the selfie shooter is a beast based on your photography skills. The glass back is damn premium and the display is killer full HD. The camera has alot of features AR is inbuilt and also has slowmo. The sound quality​ is better but there are few best in the market and the battery backup is good not the best tho it lasts a long day even I use for office use but what's to worry about the fast charging is damn awesome. Over all I want to say I'm happy with my phone it's totally amazing driver, I really love it. Thanks Honor 😊	5

20284	I brought 2 mobiles the sale. Redmi 6 pro for my dad and honor 8x for me. I live in a village where mobile signals are low.Redmi 6 pro has better signal strength and better battery backup.Honor 8x has better camera and screen.Picture quality and sound quality are good in both phones.For video there is no EIS on Honor but slow motion works great.Redmi has IRblaster Honor doesn't.	4

20291	Nyc picture quality	5
20292	Battery discharge too early, not more than 3 to 4 hours if continue. I really very disappointed.	2
20293	Awesome cellphone in this price range one and only one of the best cellphone... Go for it without any doubt..Purchased on 24-Oct-2018. It comes along with pre applied screengaurd. Back side is fully glass but unbreakable. By miatake my cellphone dropped 2 times but not a single dent or scratch.. It means build quality is execelent.Battery is only 3750MAH but trust me it gives backup more then my previous note 5 pro.. could be honor is using latest processor which utilized less battery.. It gives 2 days battery backup with normal uses.I found only 1 drawback here :1. Earphone and speaker sound is less compare to note 5 pro.Apart from these go for this without any doubt. Display is just awesome.Thanks guys.. If you like this comment hit on thumsup!!!	5

20299	Excellent MobileDisplay was amazing and looks premium	5
20300	Everything Goes as per expectations!Go for it	5
20301	This phone possibly has one of the best camera in its segment. The daylight photos are amazing.The phones body is very slim and has very premium feel to it. The camera bump is a small problem though. If not taken care with an appropriate case, the camera's glass will get scratched easily.The phone does have some irksome bugs though. The proximity sensor does not work as expected and many times the screen does not get deactivate during a call. This can cause the options on the screen getting invoked unintentionally.	4
20302	This smartphone has best quality pictures ,sound and the most important battery Life. I am really impressed by its performance and I think u should take its really among the best products of Xiaomi , really impressed !!	5

20313	A great phone at a great price I am really stunned with the product quality and its performance.

20324	This is my 4th Xiaomi phone in last 3 yrs and this is the worst one I got. This phone is a mess. I am not sure why Xiaomi is not fixing the issues on this phone. I wasted my money on this. This has got horrible cons like:1. this phone will never show you notificaiton icon at status bar. So basically, you will get a sound or vibration that something app has got a notification but you cant see at the phone screen top status bar which is something a 3rd class phone also shows. So this means you will have either have to slide down the top of screen to check the hidden status bar or foolishly keep sliding and check which App has a notification. Worst experience.2. Screen is sluggish  to navigate, slow one.3. Sound out put is not that good.4. Camera is average.5.MIUI being 9.6 is very disaapointing and not user friendly. I was using redmi note 5 pro and it was far better.  I bought this one just because of smaller size to easily fit into pocket. i am regretting now.Verdict: Better go for redmi note 5 pro and avoid this one atleast.	1
20325	Camera are very very ppor	1
20326	Product may be manufacturing defect, it restarts automatically many times	2

20362	Battery life is very poor	3
20363	I am no satisfied	1
20364	Writing this review after using the device for one week.every one is complaining about the battery life but in my moderate to heavy usage the device lasted for a full working day.my usage includes few minutes of social media ,YouTube,few minutes of calling,camera,and one or two games of pubg. There was no heating issue ,it was quite normal. Although the bundled charger is a standard 10w charger the charging speed is good. before using this device I used Moto g5s plus which has a turbo charger, this mi a2 also charged at same speed.Pros:Camera.Good performance.Cons:Average battery.Auto brightness and proximity sensors calibration.	4
20365	Love it.... Battery life superb.... Camera superb.... Looks awesome all in one 9 out of 10	5
20366	Overall its value for money phone, but i have one issue with this phone is  that it's selfie picture quality is not very good as compare to other brands in same price band.	4

20369	Oh my god# i got this phone and its getting heated up instantly. I expected a lot from LG and it is foolish to buy this. Amazon is not providing refund for it too. Battery gets charged very slowly.  Display is good and camera is just ih my gosh. .CELKON and Micromax cameras are better than this. Waste of time anf happiness .....not worthy	1
20370	The front camera is wast .is there no face beauty option	1
20371	The camera takes good quality pictures.	4
20372	Both cameras give me stunning clicks even in low light. However an audio jack should have been included. But apart from that there is no issue. Battery life is decent and amazing sound quality. Just loved it. Its been around 3 months using A2 at its best. High qraphics games like PubG can be played for around 3 hours continuously without heating the phone much. No lags and its flawless. A must purchase and value for money.🤩😍	5

20401	"Bought Honor 8X (6+128GB, Midnight Black) Invoice No.MAA4-657381, delivered on (03/12/2018). While in the specification of the mobile, it is stated that the outer body of the mobile is crafted and shining, the actual outer body of the mobile supplied is plain, simple and very ordinary (Photo attached). And the label outside states that the mobile is ""Made in India""! I have read Made in China only for this mobile brand even in the reviews of the product details. Doubt the quality of the mobile."	3

20406	A top class poweful beast and I got that for 12,999. What a deal. Worth every penny. Must go for it. Studio light, Wide lens aperture, Lag free UI is amazing and notch makes it look like poco f1. Beautiful. Don't waste time in review videos. They will always compare with little more high end phones. that's how their channel runs. But trust me guys. You will not regret buying it.READ MORE	5

20416	Look wise it's good, RAM and Processor are good enough,,,,, only con is Camera especially back one, doesn't Clicking any image,,, always Blurred and if you are trying zooming then Worst part of the Camera came up.	3
20417	I am disappointed with a couple of features, thought the display is good.There is auto dialling that happens without one having set it. When you end up a call, immediately there is one more call that happens (and no -- it's not the recently dialed number)! God knows  how some name or number gets selected from contacts and without your knowledge the call gets connected. You will end up explaining you had not dialled the number! phew! I explored the settings several times and failed to find any option to remove this feature.Another problem is the sound quality of music player or audio/video! It's poor even when you set it at maximum!Regretting my decision of having chosen this unusual and not so popular piece!	4
20418	Superb Mobile	5
20419	But	2

20437	I liked this mobile because I want a perfect camera but in night time we have drained camera performance battery life is perfect in 15k - 25k because we have only 3000mAh but draining slowly . charging is not perfect but we have 1/2 fast chargingThe main problem is we do not get gorilla glass if you are a hard user I say do not buy this (no gorilla glass) GPU is not perfect but super (Mali) slow motion is only 120fps if you want to bokeh in front cam please don't buy this front bokeh is very bad back can is super perfect bokeh is awesome you can refocus with wide apreture . EMUI is super but applock is vary failure because we get big app screen in recent apps then we can read or take a srnsht in that Huawei please make block the recent apps I give this phone 9.5/10	5
20438	A camera is awesom and battery life is long with such processor. .. A sound quality with dual speakers is attraction	5

20472	Overall nice product.	5
20473	I brought this phone on the launch day itself and now i regret after 2 days of usage.##main problem : heating issue.With normal usage (normal internet surfing and even when downloading from playstore) itself ,the aluminium frame on the sides of the phone is getting heated like i cant hold it anymore.Display of the phone is excellent and may be this screen and the low level processor (snapdragon 435) is making the phone an iron box.Battery back up is also below average.I won't recommend it to anyone ,even to my worst enemies as if now.Hopefully LG comes with a software update and fix this to some extend.	2
20474	Front camera not good	1

20499	picture quality is average but sound and battery backup is very good...overall this a fantastic phone in such a price..	5
20500	Battery drain very fast. Even clear all running app it drain	2
20501	Nice to handling with phone sound,display,look ok front camera not satisfied me. Gaming with frnd via wifi very bad...otherwise all ok..	4

20509	Very disappointed  with the phone performance. Plz don't buy it.. wastage of money. Battery performance is very poor. Bought it a week ago n very disappointed. Very shameful mi	1
20510	Best Phone in this segment... price is little high but worth it.. battery backup is very good. it lasts more than 24 hours with moderate use with wifi, web browse etc. very good built quality, No lag but not fast. display is so good. Most of the apps has no full vision capability but it will come in the future i hope that, the phone is capable for FV but not all the apps. Little bit heating issue but not a problem. good mobile reception. Rear speaker will make issue of less sound. charging is fast. within 2 hours it will charge more than 90%. No issues till today.. you can buy without worry.	5
20511	Phone is very good , but sound quality is okay. Especially when you put speaker on you will not get much big sound. Over all its worth to buy for 9K bucks.	5

20528	Picture quality is not as expected but overall gud..rear camera bump gets scratch soon as suitable back case is not available in the market.	4
20529	I'd request the buyers... Do not opt for this phone... Look wise it's really gud but as a product Nah. I've received this phone on 2nd Jan, 2019 n today it's 16th Jan, 2019.m facing a lot of problem with this. While using this phone it is automatically getting switched off n on, it gets hanged for a longer period n if u want to switch it off during that dat period even the power button also doesn't work. Even the battery is also not doing well... Frankly not happy with this phone😑	3
20530	Does it support 512 GB micro sd card	5
20531	surprised with amazon,because i ordered this phone on 21th evening,and i received package today by 11.30 a.m.specially thanks to amazon.now look back to device....experience....1- 18:9 full vision display.with super amoled come out the box with 2.5d curved glass.in case of display this device left the all other to back in this 13000 range.touch is very responsive like a brand device.2-Lg Q6 has 13 mp rear and 8mp front camera along with flash.but i realized at my first 15 minutes of experience with the Q6 camera is perform good not excellent in outdoor condition.but......in the indoor its perform very poor the both cameras.3- its 3000 mah battery not sounds like good in this price range,because we know that 7k to 9k we got 4000 mah battery and its life is very good.4-its perform on snapdragon 435 which was octacore 1.4ghz processors with 3gb ram...its not pretty much high other than any of devices?ok but as i say that i have test run my first minute with Lg Q6,its very disappointing me,because  i feel the device getting very heat whether i test only with camera,settings,and the system ui.thats the matter with Rs13000.not heavy heat but also think that i just run only common services on it.ok,that's it .but my opinion is so clear about the deivce,that in the Rs13000 Lg provide only the beauty full display,sounds,ui.if ur satisfy with the feature then go for it....Thank u..	3
20532	Front camera has so much of noise in low light.Primary camera is good only during proper lighting.Not good for low light photography.Mobile hangs after 1 month of usage.Speaker sound is fantastic.	3

20546	Best screen and camera	5
20547	Much has been said about this great device. This is a perfect phone for those looking for device in price range within 15k. Exceptionally fast, great battery, beautiful screen, and last but not the least, it comes with Android Oreo out of the box. Though, the camera is bit hyped. Honestly speaking, I am not satisfied with camera quality, but hey that doesn't mean it is bad or something, just doesn't quite works in low lighting and lack EIS /OIS and 4k, which I feel are the only shortcomings of this Beautiful phone. Not to mention this phone is refreshingly gorgeous, premium glass back, and perhaps the smallest bezels. Loved this device, and extremely SATISFIED!	5

20614	Awesome phone. It's far more better than REDMI NOTE 5 PRO, in terms of built quality, premium looks,screen quality and also in so many terms.1. Nokia 6.1 plus has 5.8 inch sreen but in terms of phone dimensions ,it's far lesser than REDMi NOTE 5 PRO and interestingly lesser than REDMi note 3. which makes it light weight easy to carry and less bulky.2.Built quality is premium and it terms of looks ,honestly it makes surrouding people jealous and not only Redmi users even iPhone user feel j...READ MORE	5
20615	I ordered this product as it was good on paper and was in a good price bracket.The phone worked fine for a week, but then it started having range issues. Then the speaker sound used to go off intermittently, as though someone is putting the speaker on and off continuously, then the same started with the calling speaker too. I always have to restart the phone to make it alright. But it reoccurs again. Will wait for a week and then take it to the service station.	2
20616	Appearance wise is good looking, but a lot needs to be desired from the perspective of software and camera.	2

20642	It's a good budget phone.Speaker is really good.Finger print sensor and the voice speech recognition feature of Google need to be better in this particular device. Over all this is a good budget phone with good battery life.	4
20643	Really good. Face unlock is very fast. Loveit	5
20644	Amazing phone.... Its fast, durable for daily use and owns a great AI powered battery enough to take you through the day. The kirin 710 performs very well in terms of gaming. The camera quality is also great. The glass back gives an amazing feel of a flagship phone in hand.The sound quality could have been improved a little.Honor 8x also lacks flash charging. But thats just a software update issue. Hope to see a flash charge software update for this amazing phone in the future.	4
20645	It's a good phone with good battery back up and sound quality	5
20646	Not a good phone to buy worst camera. And battery life is poor	1

20649	The phone will start to hang after using for 1 month and battery is also not up to expectation, needs charging twice in a day.	2

20666	First of all I got the phone on time as mentionedThe think I like about the phone is the looks and build quality. It feels premium and have a large and beautiful 6.5 inch screen. I like each and every bit of it.But the thingI didn't like is the saturation level it make everything more colourfull which I didn't like. And it does not have image stabilisation.But other than the phone is badasss....	4
20667	In this range, this is awesome.some new features are included by honor. Best part is the screen of this mobile is quite good as it is full view screen.camera is up the mark. Lots of new features are included by the honor as compare to their earlier,you have to changed it as per your requirement. Regarding battery, I used it for the full day. Overall I love this phone.

20702	Overall good product by Samsung.	5
20703	Within 3 months ringtone sound is broken	3
20704	The battery is a slight letdown but I guess that's more due to using dual SIM cards at the same time. Works great though and is really nice looking.	5
20705	Stunning display and battery backup..	5
20706	Product quality is not so good as we expecte. Lacks camera qualit, battery life  is average.  Sound quality and look is good is pretty much impressiv.  Over all average on that price range. Honor should give better from that.	3

20711	Everything is fine for general user except heating issue on left side of the phone around volume rockers and sim tray even on 15 min usage. Its getting hot and its hard to hold the phone in your hand after 30 min of use. Common LG provide some OTA to solve this heating problem. I purchased it keeping in mind the Brand name but disappointed.  My earlier REDMI Note 3 was better as no issue was there and it was not as costly as q6.	2

20743	Writing this review after three weeks of usage.Iam not going to mention any specs because you guys know it already. I will point out the things that experienced great for me.1. Excellent design. 👌The dual tone will look extremely premium on your hand. I think there are no such device currently look this much good under this price category. Period!2. Night shot on camera -As usual honor cameras are doing pretty well. The night mode at this device will provide clear shots during night time.3.Lag free bloatware less EMUI- Unlike the redmi and vivo phones, the EMUI will provide you smooth and lag free performance. The kirin 710 and 4gb of ram will do the job efficiently.4. Charging and battery- Even if there is no fast charging available, this device will charge upto 90% within 1.30 hr. The battery will last for 1.5 days with normal usage.5. For PUBG lovers-  you can play any high graphics game like pubg with no issues.6. Efficient notch -Iam not a big fan of notch, But this device comes with smaller notch, and it includes notification LED! It may be silly thing.But LED not available in many devices with notch.Thanks for reading guys. Trust me guys, this is a beast under 20k category👌	5

20784	The best phone available in the market today under 20000 and a phone which can even compete with other flagship phones. Everything is good about this phone. The USP of the phone is its look and built quality. It looks classy and premium and it's display is amazing. It's battery on paper is just 3080mah but in terms of performance it will easily beat a 4500mah from other brands. It super smooth and buttery while using and Android One interface is just pure.

20818	Firstly I give 5 🌟 for performance, looks and battery  I love to play Asphalt 8 airborne and with high graphics no lag and can handle multitasking well battery backup is really good for 3750 mah it can last for 7 hours with heavy usage with continuous game play and easily last for 1 and half day with moderate usage.I like bug free emui I previously use redmi device  I leave mi because of buggy os but emui is smooth and lag free#When it comes to camera it's bit disappointing but not that bad low light performance is up to Mark but saturated photos is the only problem.# loud speaker is not much loud when compared to redmi note 5#  earphones sound is too low equaliser is not good need some update hope these con's are solved with software updates	4

20830	Nice and attractive screen I like it	5
20831	I bought blue colour variant of this phone.. First of all packing and delivery of the phone was good and on time. Box having phone.. Charger.. One case... About the physical look ; the phone gives a premium finish with a heavy look and feel. Both side are glass finish with a multishade colour on back side of the phone which gives a superb look. It got a big screen with low chin on the bottom which makes the phone an awesome look.. Got a good weight and feel.. Abot performance;, it got a superspeed overall and clarity of phone is excellent.. Battery capacity was good. Will get one day full charge with a heavy use of phone. It doesn't get heated still.. Camera quality was superb with different modes.. Especially night mode.. Superslow motions and portrait mode for selfie camera.. This phone is a real competitor with other phones with same budget.	5
20832	Its budget segment	5
20833	Very good device full paisa wasool	5
20834	All most fine	4
20835	I recieved this phone yesterday here is the detailed review..In the box:1 phone1warantty card1user manual1sim ejector pin1protective case1pre applied screen guard1micro USB cable1chargerPros:1)Nice and stunning looks(Blue colour)2)Design and build quality is awesome3)Notch is very small and chin is very less4)Battery life is excellent5)No lags or hanging issues6)Camera performance is nice and many of tons of features in camera if you like vibrant colours7)EMUI has a ton of features8)All sensors are there9)Picture quality is superb10)Best phone compared to realme 2 proCons:1)EIS is not included2)Camera is not suitable for natural colours lovers3)Has a lot of preinstalled apps	5
20836	Best mobile in range and also its features are very good in use	5
20837	Just got the LG Q6 delivered today. The handset is black in color and premium in looks. The weight feels just right in hand and gives a very comfort feeling. Volume and power buttons gives the right tactile feeling. Camera - both front and back, are good and produces correct color even at indoor tube light.Good things that I like:- double tap locks the phone- Comfort view (under display settings) soothes the eye at night, specially at dim lights- extra length help in reading pdf or articles/web- Tiny to large fonts with multiple font faces help- battery life seems to be good- touch is smooth (although I am not a gamer and would not know its performance during a game)- Sides are metal, so gives a better feeling at hand. However, once you have a back cover, you need not get the metal feelingThings that lack- Sound is soft and not loud enough- Speaker is at the back, so ringer volume has to be at the max level- Front and back cameras are at little awkward position	5
20838	Camera pics are not good at all special back cam having dual cam stabilization problem front cam like VGA pics. No return policy in amazon .	1
20839	Is product OK but  Redmi model is samthingNew not is regularly featured  looking mobile but New features availability trying ok	5
20840	Best thing is, does not heat up. I'm in love. You will get to know why it is 2-3k bugs expensive once u use it	5
20841	When we switch it off and then try to on , it takes too many attempts and just vibrates	2
20842	Overall its a very good product. Good price	5
20843	I bought it for my sister...she said front camera is not  but other features are really adorable	5
20844	Best mobile i am happy	5
20845	"Nice mobile. Voice clarity and signal reception are excellent. Though screen size is 5.8"" it's looking small and easy to use. Display is good.Some problem with system launcher. Apps are not arranged alphabetical order and it's not supporting Google now launcher. So we have to use another one like Nova etc."	5
20846	Very low quality of front camera also back camera picture quality so bad	3
20847	Size very big so didnot handle with single hand	3
20848	Battery is quite weak ..Overall a very good phone. Price worth it.	4

20850	Very nice look and model disine .	5
20851	Although phone is alright but the screen size is just 5 inch, which is very disappointingOne should not buy it, you can go for mi y2 or mi note 5 which are far better than this	3
20852	Its a worst product .Within 4 months the not switch on n not chargeble Pls help out if it is possible	1
20853	Strong battery backup. No apps lagging.	5
20854	Delivered one day earlier....!!total value for money...nice phone...feels so gud in hands n running smoothly...just go fr it!!! :-)	5
20855	Honor is best phone....I am using 6x before...it's solid build quality and better performance phone...but I sold it for its worst UI experience..I bought 8x for my cousin and it is also satisfy those aspects....it's slightly modified with latest design... screen size.. but they are using same UI...But still I hate this UI....pls change UI design... other you can make it is a market leader.	3
20856	I think this must be the best choice of mobile at this cost	4
20857	Back camera is awesome but front camera is above average & battery life is too good &  sound quality on earpiece is classy but quit low speaker of bottom	5
20858	First time I have purchased new honor 8x phone. I'm very happy from this phone. Camera, sound,battery and display quality is very good. If any buddy want to purchase new phone then my suggestion is only for this phone because this beat phone under 15k. Thanks honor team and Amazon.	5
20859	Good. One	4
20860	Every thing is good except battry	5
20861	Nice picure quality	5

20871	Battery is good as tym passes by battery efficiency recuces.	5
20872	Hi all, I have purchased Mi A2 black 6gb RAM, 128gb phone. I was given an exchange price of Rs 5341 for my old Redmi 4, which i felt was really good. So, ordered this. During the delivery, I was unable to reset and erase data on my old phone for which I took a help from the delivery agent. To my surprise, the delivery guy erased and reset my phone (infact locked it) and then says that the screen is broken and will not be taken for exchange. After much discussion, he called someone and informed me to pay 2500 for the screen else cancel the order. Since my phone was locked and reset I had no option but to pay that amount and get rid of it. This is the worst experience I have ever had with Amazon.please specify the correct exchange value and also if something fall short, at least a mode to do that additional payment. Now I am not even sure where that money went as I paid it to the delivery agent.The phone is good except for the sound quality. The sound is too low and cant hear a video or movie when outside. Else it is good.	1
20873	Best phone under 15000	4
20874	3***	3
20875	Nice style	5
20876	I'm a moderate user in phone, the battery drains so quickly	3
20877	Great phn but only flash sale is problem nd 9,000 is price better	3
20878	Oh manWhen I put this thing in my handThis was exactly a 'look alike' of note 5 proThe difference was just a changed front camera position (to the left)Anyway,Coming to the deviceFABULOUS DISPLAY (just like note 5 pro i.e. 5.99 fhd+)SPECTACULAR CAMERAGreat portraits both from front and backGreat videosYou also can change the lens to low light or regularIncredible 1080p slow-mo (only good when in good light conditions otherwise ok-ok)BATTERY LIFEOh my goshI expected the worst but got good (not best lmao)3000 mAh works like 3500 acc. To me.Bonus features:Stock AndroidGorilla glass on camera along with displayCase with that thing (lightweight and flexible)USB type cNo headphone jack😅🤨😫 (I use BT headset)1 more important thing:I didn't think there is really a proximity sensor issue. At least not in my device.	4
20879	Q6 phone is owsam amazin phone 1st time lg minimum price superb wide angle camara and holding griping phine good battery.	5
20880	it is sssooooooo fast!	4
20881	Phone is very handy and good for daily use with best, it's not chinese.Regular security updates.Good screen.Sound quality is not good and loud.No finger print sensor.No led notification.No fast charging.	3

20884	the best item	5
20885	I loved it. Overall performance is good. Camera quality is simply awesome.	5
20886	I really don't like it it really lags too much .. really camera sucks and even sometimes it works on it's own	1
20887	Picture quality is amazing, sound quality very good, Battery average,	5
20888	exclt	5
20889	MOTO name is a complete message of Quality Product.	5
20890	Face unlock does not work properly (you need to keep the phone at different dimensions/up & down to unlock). Speaker sound quality for songs is average (I am comparing it with Lenovo K6 Power which has Dolby sound). Picture quality is good among chinese phones. All latest features viz. photo by waving hand, penaorama etc are available. Speed is good in comparison to my Motorola E5+ phone (which hangs and is slow). Battery life is good for a days work. I am satisfied overall and find it as per my expectations (I have not used Oneplus / Iphone / other high end phones so far).	4
20891	Nowhere near my expectations. This phone was boasted for great low light photography but it is producing poster-like pictures. Too disappointed	2
20892	Excellent performance.	4
20893	What a brilliant product, at this price point. This is Gold worth having for any sort of usage related to mobile, gaming, clicking pictures or even the sound quality (Could have done better here as I'm comparing with iPhone). Overall i used this product in last few days & now has got updated to android 9 Pie (Best thing you can have from Android / Google). Just go for it whenever available under 15K. Compared to Mi, ViVo, LG, Sony, Oppo... This Nokia is far far better than any contemporary products available even  under 20K... Just loved the device & can't get off it :)	5
20894	Dont buy this ....game is not playing well...pubg never	3
20895	Gud for me	5
20896	few things to consider: i am not a heavy user of the mobile phone for games or video edits and i might be prejudiced from the bit of research done prior buying this phone (more so for the price). this phone has more than decent features, and a certain level of future estimation as well that i will not be deprived of latest android OS updates. moving to android from ios, i know otherwise i am vulnerable of being sold as a consumer. other factors: 3.5 mm headphone jack had been fixed semi permanently to the adopter provided to listen to songs; the clear back case is already provided and am using it even though without it looks better; had to search a bit more for few things since moving from ios, but cant say better or sour; battery worked well but i have to earn my livelihood working on computers and not cell phones so not a heavy user, worked the full day with songs played for around 2 - 3 hours a day; photos are good but don't compare with google pixel and don't have any software update yet for night sight (looks excellent in pixel but the hardware there is priced at another 150 cc more).Now the worst part, the proximity sensor is horrible when i pick a call in my left ear, the phone does not get disabled and anything for that matter can get selected, DND, flashlight or anything. had to use the right ear for call purposes, but this isn't something which can be ignored since i cant be in the restroom whole day to keep my left hand occupied.	4
20897	Display quality and camera is very poor	1
20898	Phone is good, but sim eject pin and ear phones/ hands free are of poor quality. Expected better quality accessories when I am buying LG product. Especially Head phone is cheap looking and doesn't even have soft ear buds. Even a cheap Chinese phone comes with better quality accessories.	3
20899	Too much lags in while pubg game playing	3
20900	This is my first honor phone and i can't believe phone is super fast and very bright display. Design is just gorgeous with big phone display, very good for gamers and video lovers.  Kirin 710 is so fast I'm loving it  pubg game play very nice in HD graphics. Camera is just mind blowing love the super slow motion video(16x). Huge battery. Thank you honor for this beautiful phone and thank you Amazon for super fast delivery.	5
20901	worst phone in this price range do not buy it.	1
20902	Honest effort by LG, you will love the phone. I am enjoying it. Best part is made in India.	4

20909	Quality was good	5
20910	I have compared this with Redmi note 5 pro. I believe except the looks, everything is better in Redmi note 5 pro. It also costs Rs 5000 lesser. Please go for Redmi Note 5 pro. It is a real Value for money phone.	3
20911	worth for money ..i got addl dis of 1500 with selected debit cards during offer.	5
20912	Purchased this phone after comparing redmi note 4 , nokia 6 and vivo v5s. These all are really good but  not with latest tech specs. This LG Q6 display is charming and attracting.  The phone works flawlessly, some heating issue during long hour's usage .	4
20913	Very nice phone for 11k , battery back was awesome for 2 day , camera and other features also very good worth for buying. After using 3 days i am given my view and review .👌👌👌	5

20930	Looks like Premium phone. Really wondered in seeing the pictures taken in dark with front camera without using flash. Regarding Rear camera. You cant actually distinguish between photo taken in day light and night(with flash).	5
20931	Camera 4/5 , battery 5/5, display 5/5, sound 5/5 .	5

20941	Good primary camera.. Average front camera. weightless . good design but they have to make more slim . Good battery backup fast charging. Average sound quality	5
20942	Phone is in the size of a brick, this phone is actually a downgrade for me, Samsung is just selling the brand name and Will not last long atleast in this price segment. No full HD at 18k you kidding me Samsung? I overlooked this fact before purchasing this phone as fhd is a norm in this range. One of my worst phone purchases ever.	1
20943	Sound quality should be improved a little bit.	4

20947	Honor 8x is the best smartphone in 15000 range. It has awesome looks with glass body at back which feels very premium. In terms of processor it's very fast, both camera is good, speaker is also good. Only issue I m facing is battery, I don't say it is bad but it is bit low considering 3750 MAH. Overall this phone is best phone of 2018 under 15000.	4
20948	only one word to describe.. awesome!!READ MORE	4

20950	Awesome phone ✌️	5

20962	Fine and appreciatable one	5
20963	First of all its a great value for money. As it is advertised its design is sleek and also its processor is very good. The processor keep the device very optimised most of the time. Its battery life is great. One full 100 percent can last you almost a day(including some heavy gaming and surfing).Its biggest con is the speaker. Its average at best. Its camera also sometimes click some over saturated pics but most of the time it gets the job done.At the end if you are looking for a sleek premium looking phone with allround performance and a tad bit compromising in the camera department this is the ideal phone for you.	4
20964	The mobile is very handy and ideally suitable for me. Specially Battery life without any heating issue s	5

21004	I have been using p20 lite since 3 days now and I love it....It is fast, possessor does not let u downFits perfectly in hand, not too big n not too small just perfectDisplay is amazing, screen resolution is superb.	5
21005	This phone doesn't even worth a single star...Lots of issues at the cost of 14990 rupees1. Camera has got a line on the scene and the photos taken using back camera..2. Heat up issue even after taking single video3. Bettary is the worst part of this phone4. Unstable network on sim slot 25. No screen mirroring6. Worst camera quality	1
21006	Excellent product. Have an experience with Mi and Le Eco. THIS DOESNT LAG. AND FOR A STUDENT LIKE ME I LOVE THIS PHONE. Never found such an amazing flagship product before. Exchanged my Mi 4i and bought this at a very lower rate. A slight heating issue but can be ignored. Amazing charging speed. And manages almost 90% of my day schedule. As i am a student and professional, this is the best phone at this price one can get.	5
21007	Redmi 6 pro is worth buying.excellent interface.loved it.	5
21008	All except battery back up	5
21009	Opening the keypad takes time, camera is good, even in room light takes good picture.	4
21010	Very poor functioning every time hanging problem don’t buying this honor 8x model I totally wasted my mot	1
21011	Very nice phone. Cute looking. In first impression looks like 5 inch phone. Display is also very good. 3gb/32gb is enough for normal use.	5
21012	The phone quality is good and value of money...but a poorest experience I got..I got a damage charger/charger port of my phone...I report at amazon customer care..& they give a date of mobile phone inspection...now, there is nothing remain other than waiting and expectingfor a good service...but this is the first case which give a poorest experience till today...😩😤	4
21013	The smartphone market is in a strange place right now. Flagships are getting more expensive yet aren't adding much more that consumers or businesses actually want in the way of features. Meanwhile the mid range is filling with phones that have pretty much all the features you will actually use on a day-to-day basis at good prices. It's not clear how this is going to play out, but right now the level of choice for buyers is great.Bought it in Diwali sale and gifted to my brother along with Huawei P20. Its a eye candy phone looks are stunning and it's the best looking phone in this segment.Battery life is solid one day despite of the screen size, and camera quality is better than its competitors. Honor is the next big thing in the cellphone market.Thanks you for your time, its a great day.	5
21014	Nice budget phone with good battery and big display..Definitely worth a buy...	5
21015	Best budget phone.Pro:good performance. its been 3 months never hanged once.Good front camera.Sleek design.Good battery life - average 1 day.Cons :Front camera not upto the mark.	5
21016	The phone is just amazing in thus price segment..!!Great looks..and slow motion capture is nice..!!👌👌	5
21017	Very happy with the phone. Comfortable to hold in one hand (compared to others). Battery lasts a whole day, I do mostly productivity activities (emails, messaging, reddit and music), not a lot of gaming.	5
21018	1. Big 6.5' screen2. Good screen quality and resolution3. Great battery life almost a day for moderate use4. No lag what so ever5. Both Cameras are good even in low light condition.	5
21019	Bought 3 phones for my dad, mom and wife. All three phones have the same issue, better picture quality and good features but when it comes to battery, one of the worst phone. Also I tried updating teh software which was specifically released for better battery quality but still the issue is there. Battery doesn't long even for a day, it gets drained out by half or 3/4th of the day with all three phones. Really pissed off for investing on this phone.	2
21020	I am currently using it.My opinion for Mi has been changed after using it.I would say it is as my expectation.	5
21021	Very good phone for daily use... people who think s about camera quality then go for this	4
21022	Poor battery backup... I'm not happy with MI	3
21023	Very good product the delivery was on time charge stands for more than a day if you let it drain to 30%The sound is not best byt good for this priced phoneThe camera quality is top both front and backThe performance is good not lagging when switching between apps with more than ten open at the same time. It is doing good for a 4gig ramStorage is not a problem as it has 64gb and i am a regular user of drive and google photosThis phone also enters the notch club giving a larger screen place	4
21024	I'm totally disappointed to this product in all ways	1
21025	3 star is only because of its display, otherwise it is not that good as its price	3
21026	Good product and confirm the same and confirm the same and confirm the same and also the same time as the	5
21027	I have personally thanks for HUAWEI, Nice product. Price is 2k - 4k high but good and comfortable smartphone .	5
21028	Product is awesome..Picture quality on full hd+ display is fantastic..Photos taken in potrait mode using back cam produces nice pics which are of very high quality and seems very natural..Premium looking from outside..Light weighted mobile..Nicely fits in hands.Phone didn't lag on general usage..Battery back up is nice.Fitted with age-old mi ir sensor.Sound produced though a bit low than other mobiles but it's like clear & crispy filtered sound with much clarity..Finger print sensor works like charm and unlocks very quickly..Face unlock is good and is not unlocking when on closed eyes..Verdicts:I mainly found one major issue about this handset is Front camera.It's dull, particularly when in video calling like whatsapp etc, the camera gives very noisy images..and noisy videos..selfie images are bit better than videos using front cam..Even after updating with mi's update which gave stabilisation for camera,, it's a bit helpful but it didn't made wonders...And voice getting breaked when on whatsapp voice/video calls..	5
21029	Picture ,sound and battery life is good	5
21030	Redmi phonesbare getting better but costly as well.	5
21031	Everything is really great.... Just camera is not up to the mark... Pics does not look real	4
21032	I am using this phone for more than 2 months and not having any issue.	5
21033	I would like to return this item and get the redmi note 6 pro and I do not have an option to do it. It says only replacement I m not happy with the product and I have to keep it it's soo disgusting	1
21034	Camera is very poor, it is not 12+5mp I think it is 2+5mp and front is also worst.	3

21039	Within 4 days of use, serious issues in sound quality. No voice to other person on outgoing calls. Checked different sims also same issue.	1
21040	Battery life is a bit worry	3
21041	Fully satisfied with it. Worth every penny.	5
21042	After using it for 2months I can say that this is a good budget phone with good looks and an incredible battery life.	4
21043	Please dont't bye camera is good but battery back up not good	1

21047	I have waited for Nokia 6. But seeing this configuration and 18:9 full vision dispaly.I bought this phone on the day of launch in India.From usage of till date my review is belowPros1. Best in class dimensions spec in this segments (15K)2.Best in Class display ratio in this segments3. Best in class who need handy with 5.5 inches4.One hand operation is designed as more ergonomically.5.Face recognize is good.6.Its really better looking and compact compare to Nokia 6.Cons1.No finger prints sensors2.No gorilla glass3.No fast charging4.Phone is lagging bit when you are opening a facebook pics as bunch.	4
21048	Really asum but only flaw is battery is draining fast if ur social website freaker like whatsapp facebook etc.,	5
21049	Fantastic..faboulus touch great performance .Only con is low light face recognition does not work well.Need bit more efforts on this issue .Nice product future is of 18: 9 now .	4
21050	Battery is awsome and sound quality also good clear sound effect...but camera is average..👍👍	4

21052	Performance are awesome , sounds good, picture clarity good .	4
21053	Battery 🔋 is good and speaker is good and also look is good.. Best mi phone with best budget worth for money	5
21054	I am a Xiaomi fan and compared to any Xiaomi phones, the battery life sucks. Even the processor is too slow as it is an older version. Look wise very attractive, good built and above average camera.	3
21055	Exlellent Product!!!	5
21056	Nice phone.. It's a selfie era.. But this phone has only 5MP selfie camera only.. Need to cut the price to make it more budget friendly..	5
21057	sound quality is not expected and front camera is also not good. i have applied for refund.	3
21058	One of the best phone in this range, purely value for money. I’m writing this review after using LG Q6 all most one year. Phone works fantastic and without any problem till now. I believe this is best phone with strong body and full screen display.	5
21059	Best camera option under18k	4
21060	Camera is good.....overall proformance is good ....but battery is no sufficient ......if u use it heavy......so if you play game like pubg , asphalt 9 ........it,s not good for youREAD MORE	4
21061	Big in size..quality pictures. Heating up on continuous usage.	4
21062	Not the best	1
21063	I have been trying Mi A1 for Almost more than a year and now upgraded to Mi A2  ... It's feel so nice to hold 😍😍 same stock Android experience 🙂🙂 Got this handset for only 13500 🎉🎉🎊🎊 camera is superb, display is brilliant however battery is same as before but i can easily get 8 hours screen time	5
21064	Best ever smart phone i have used in my life (out of 6 Smart phones).Cons:1. front camera quality is bad2. Quality of audio output is not good compared to Moto	5
21065	The phone has a great display and very beautiful screen with notch . The camera quality is fabulous but the camera can be more.	5
21066	Excellent design. Easily adjusts in hand. I liked this phone because I do not love to play games nor I am fond of photography for which some people had shown negative feed for thisbphone.Design is excellent.	5
21067	This phone hangs a lot. I put 64gb micro sd card in it. After that it started to hang.Disappointed by the phone.	3
21068	It's one of the best notch display phones in this range.. Other two best phones in this category are Honor 9n and newly launched Realme 2 pro.. Realme 2 pro is a good phone, but don't know whether it will be on sale for atleast 2 seconds in the flash sale because of its high demand.. I prefer redmi 6 pro over honor 9n because of the reputation of Xiaomi brand.. From redmi 1s onwards I am using Xiaomi mobiles and they did not disappoint yet.. Now let's go through pros and cons of this mobile..Pros.------1. Superb display.. It's crisp, clear and bright.. you can not take your eyes off the display.. I am using LG G6 with 2k display as my first phone for last 1 year and believe me Redmi 6 pro's display is more brighter than LG G6..2. Powerful battery.. It is easily lasting for 2 days even after moderate use and full time on 4G..3. Nice design and build quality.. Even though  the bezzels are little bit thick compared with honor 9n still it looks more premium in looks.Cons-------1. Front camera is worst compared to other models..2. Bezels are little bit thicker than other notch phones3. Rear camera is just ok.. it works well in day light.. but in low light/indoors it disappoints you..	5
21069	Battery life is the main highlight of this phone.	4
21070	Dont waste your momey	1
21071	very good phone.  i buy it 3 month ago. no any problem till now.	5
21072	Nice  phone	5
21073	Everything is fine except the battery life.Pro- Screen quality, premium look, processor, a fabulous camera.Cons- Battery backup.	5
21074	The looks of this phone is really awesome..... and the camera quality is also great... but I was playing a high graphics game like PubG , modern combat 4.... it wasn't smooth.... it wasn't lagging too.... overall this phone is average but not for gaming.... you can go for Honor play for gaming... that's a machine...	5
21075	Nice sleek phone	4
21076	Best phone in this rang I like a lot  .....Love this notch display...love the dual camera but average process	5
21077	Very good feel of Pure Stock Android	5

21079	Just on word awesome	5
21080	Good phone. Build quality is good. Looks are also good. Lacks gorilla glass. Speaker quality not too great. Camera is good for instagram users who use lot of filters. Images have a yellowish tint in it. Doesn't look natural.When the phone was delivered I had a bump on the screen guard because of a grain between the screen and the guard. I removed the guard and Now the screen guard is not available in the local market.	5

21137	Good smartphone with great battery life.screen quality is also good overall a good budget smartphone.	4
21138	I am using this mobile from 20 days, below are my observation :1. Look & Feel : Beautiful2 Battery : Its not 2 days battery back up, even battery get discharged very fast, but yes battery works for single day.3. Camera : Awesome, both back as well as front.4. Charger : Fast charging, idk why but they delivered Y2 charger.Only Battery is the issue, otherwise mobile is really Good	3
21139	Call menu does not have enough options to do con call smoothly	4
21140	Very bad camera	1
21141	Supper mobile phone	5
21142	Its an worst phone which I bought ... Camera clarity its absolutely rediculas...Get hot while on call.... Recommendation don't girl for it	1
21143	Having low sound and unable to listen sound through the headphone	3
21144	Compare to vivo which i was using mi  is far better specialy in batttery backup.only disadvantage is that there is no headphone jack.	5
21145	Dabba	2
21146	awosome phone	5
21147	I lik it best honor 8x bt flash light is down ligth	5
21148	Phone is missing features on many aspects. Battery backup is very poor. Need software update for this.	2
21149	Quite good...bt one thing which dissapointed me is camera quality....it was not same as described/expected...	4
21150	Beautiful design but both front and back get scratches easily. Front doesn't have Gorilla Glass Display. Back is plastic which is beautiful for the first few days. So you need to get screen guard and back cover protection if you need to protect your phone.The sides are military-grade certified and are really strong and durable. Fell once on the sides and the phone isn't damaged in any way.Average day battery backup is good. Get almost 2 days with 4G and WiFi almost always on and normal browsing, music, videos, calls, messaging. No games though.If the phone is being charged and used heavily together, the device gets heated a little.The screen is beautiful, camera performance is decent for an average user, audio quality is fine.According to my usage patterns, this phone is a good buy, affordable and looks premium.	4
21151	Its amazing mobile ever i seen.1- Pure Stock Android, So cool design, quick updates.2- Powerful Snapdragon 660 Chipset, No lag, Amazing Gaming in terms of Asphalt 8,9, Real Racing etc3- Amazing Camera in terms of portrait, HDR, slow motion.Overall Awesome Device,  i was waited it from rumors of launching.I got it from Amazon at 13499 & 1000 pay balance. Thanks to xiaomi & Google.	5
21152	This mobail redmi 6pro  no invoice  copy  inside  in parsal	1
21153	Nice phones. Some minor OS problems are there.	4
21154	All is well..	4
21155	Very Good phone Good quality	5
21156	I canceled the product after buying because no 3.5mm jack. Otherwise go for it for this configuration.	5
21157	Awesome display and made. Really a affordable mobile phone with all high end features including artificial intelligence.	5
21158	After 1 week of usage of mi a2... At 3rd day While charging phone heated like iron box . Battery level was 75 % and I unplugged the charger. Phone suddenly goes off. And I switched on the phone . Display flashes in white for three times suddenly battery percentage drops to zero. After sometime I charged the phone it backs to normal and no heating issue I don't know why it happened . If it happens another time I'll go for replacement.	3
21159	Best looks	5
21160	Really awesome mobile... It satisfies my requirement of strong built high performing mobile.. Fits well in pant pocket... LG has given quality product in budget price...	5
21161	I like battery life and camera.but missing native video call .Honor 1ot update for video call option enable	4
21162	Battery life degrade with the usage rest all good.. not able to find screen guard and back cover that will fit it	3
21163	First Thanks to Amazon for your return policy due to which I am able to return the faulty 6 Pro as the battery was draining very fast. Now post replacing the order from the same seller everything is working much fine.Delighted with the portrait mode for back and front cameras.	4
21164	All is good on the phone. You can play PUBG without any heating and graphics is also good. The only thing is that the camera is very bright  means Instagrammers will like it more ,natural color comes in AI mode only even slow motion is quite good in this price range	4
21165	good service with good product from flipkart.READ MORE	5
21166	Nyc Phone	4
21167	First of all amazon is doing great job with there in time delivery. Now coming to the product that is LG Q6 1. Camera is not as promised in Ads by LG i mean people would say what would i expect from a phone with this price but sorry to say other companies such as motorola and nokia they are doing fair job with there camera at this price2. But overall the phone gives a very premium feel while holding it or using apps except camera. The shinny backs looks classic but at the same time it is exposed to n number of possibilities of getting scratches.3. Design and display of the phone is good.4. Phone runs full day on single 100% charge on fair amount of usage.Its not about value for money as the features that is in the device are premium but the quality of those features could have been better	3
21168	Main battery	4
21169	Good phone, nice screen. But battery back up is not that great.	4
21170	Looking good . mobile hanging problem . plz help me	2
21171	If you are looking at a full featured budget offering @15000/- this is Not the phone for you... It just has a great screen, that's it nothing else... Everything else is just below average Camera, Processor Speed, battery manages to last through the day...Some camera features came with the default app but they just heat the phone... No casting, No Finger print and might not see the next update either..If you are not ready to compromise on everything for the screen, wait for the price to be less than rs. 10000..Thoroughly Disappointed!!!😢😢😢	1
21172	its cool and have and great features but disappoint me in some of departement although it's good.	4
21173	Picture quality, battery life ,  sound quality is good till now (17 days of use)., as per the brand Xiaomi .But,  I am suppose to get a cash back as i brought it on offer, but didn't got it. Worst customer service Amazon.	3
21174	Very good display. Good processor. Average battery life. Good camera. Good build quality. Average speaker volume.	5

21178	Total waste of money..not good	1
21179	Very nice 7991129802	5
21180	Been using the device for 3 days and one thing is for sure the device is gorgeous to hold in your hand and the display and touch response is flagship class. Got it for 10000 in exchange offer and extremely satisfied with it. Performance is good. Speed won't disappoint you. Not much of a gamer so can't tell about that. Rear camera is good and front camera is good too but front camera could have been better, but that doesn't means it's bad. Battery is surprisingly good given that I use 4g net the whole day and still it gives me one day battery backup. Fingerprint scanner isn't there but that's not a -ve point, you get face recognition which to my surprise is pretty fast and accurate, though you will struggle with it in the dark. A decent buy and recommendable if you are not into the Chinese brands like xiaomi , vivo, oppo etc.	5
21181	The best budget phone for this pricethe display looks marvellousThe phone looks very slim and sleek I recommend using a grip case or the provided case coz there are maximum chances it might fallThere is some battery  issue with this device but performance is excellent	5

21201	Cons...1. The battery life is very short compared to other brand. The power is not withstanding for more than 4hrs for continuous video and using camera.2. It doesn't support Finger print camera photo shoot.3. There is no Face unlock feature and there is not eye sensor option which is available commonly in other brands in this price range.4. The price is much cheaper in the local multi-branded showroom than the amazon. The stock also available there in much color variant.After using for a week of this mobile. am getting these many negative things in this mobile. i dont know how much it will be in long run.Not happy with the product	3
21202	Bought this product for my wife, because she was fed up with her iPhone which she bought only a few months back. She has been praising this phone ever since she got it.Pros:1. Face unlock works accurately2. Great and sharp display (18:9)3. Brilliant Camera (Front and Back)4. Great Battery Life5. Great thin cover for free6. Phone is very slim and looks classy7.

21248	All is ok except both camera clearity	4
21249	Overall I am impressed with this product. This is one of the best bezel less phone at this price range.The 18:9 vision display is a revolution in mobile technology. For those who can't purchase iphone X this is the best and the cheapest option.ProsAwesome screen ratioWide angle selfie option & good selfie cameraNice color reproduction and great viewing anglesPhone doesnt lag too muchBody is made of high quality metalApps look great in 18:9 ratioConsNo finger print sensorBack cover is made of plastic and is a finger print magnet. You can solve this issue by purchasing a back cover thoughCamera could have been much betterHeadphones are average quality and charger should have been a fast charger considering 3000mah batteryAfter 1 weekCons of the phone1) Phone hangs at time if we open multiple apps2) Need to charge continuously at least 2 or 3 a day on heavy usage3) No slow motion video capture4) Face detection fails in low light and is useless at night times5) Back is full of scratch marks	4
21250	Now , I bought this #Redmi6Pro in the very 1st sale, 3GB, 32GB version.Build and components involved:-Phone's build with the infamous notch looks good and simple yet attractive.-Metal clad unibody design-Dual camera set up at back looks attractive too.-Normal USB 2.0 port with 3.5mm jack.-4000mAh battery, with 2Amp charger.-No fast charging.Peformance :Screen -Screen is 1080P IPS panel, full screen panel.Cameras -Cameras are not too good, but not at all bad.Camera (rear) quality is better than one on #RedmiY2.-Front camera is normal 5MP snapper.Battery- Battery performance is one whole day battery on single charge. So plug charger in night remove in the morning (as after full charger it'll automatically disconnect charger current running to the phone).Processor- The old yet trusted Snapdragon 625 octa-core CPU, good for normal race games (NOT much suitable for PUBG). Bit of lag sometimes here and there.RealMe2Pro has got a bang for buck deal here with looks and processor. But, OPPO's sub-brand Realme cannot be trusted for quality overall the components including after sales service.I prefer, Xiaomi has better charger quality and build over glass-clad Oppo RealMe 2 Pro	3

21252	First things first, I have rated 4 stars because of the worst service from flipkart, and not the Motorola. It is the most amazing product by Motorola in a low price range. Performance, Battery backup, Camera, everything is very good and above expectations. But, I'm eagerly waiting for the updates when we finally get the slo-mo and other camera functions. Only thing I didn't like about this purchase was THE DELIVERY! Flipkart, you suck! Why the hell does it take 2 and half days to ship the pro...READ MORE	4

Rear camera with dual LED flash is no doubt amazing.2) Battery is whopping 4000 mAh which is genuinely very good. It lasts much more than I thought.3) The processor SD 636 was being th...READ MORE	5

21274	Nice mobile but front camera quality is not good....	5
21275	Got this phone at 12k during Amazon sale at that time, phone was 16k.1. Cam under daylight is better than good but on par with those phones which are there now in less than 17k range. However, in door and low light pic quality is not good. Video is decent. But for this price range, this may not be better in cam but decent one.2. Sound system is good enough.3. Battery life is decent enough. All decent smart phones gives one day to little more than a day and this one is such a decent one.4. Heating issue is there. Esp when you view videos for more than 5-10 min duration. No heating during call or cam use.5. Charging speed is moderate. Not fast and not slow. 1:45 - 2 hours6. Screen is good. Pixels and 18:9 ratio is good. You should get a case and tempered glass as it is slippery.7. Facial recognition to unlock phone is not a great thing. Even if it is iPhone. Will miss fingerprint sensor. But you will get used to it. But u don't think this should be the deal breaker for many as there are not so great apps exists for this sensor.	4

My 2012 Nokia 700's 5mp camera is better than its 13mp . CHEAP CHINESE CAMERA2. Heating problem .3. Speaker quality is worst . Even Lenovo K6 power has Dolby Atmos4. 28nm Snapdragon 435,5.5 FHD+ screen - battery will survive your day .Don't expect full day power5. Plastic back panel ,Not fast charging6.Throw the earphones as soon as you open the pack .Why they even included it?7.NO FINGERPRINT SENSOR (I am not a fan of face unlock because it is slow ,rarely works and  it does not work in dark)8.No clock widget in UI. I had to download google clock from playstore.Verdict - A BIG NO .	1

I recommend not to purchase Redmi 6 Pro.Camera is worst.Sound Quality is bad and low.4000 mAH battery provide just 3 hours backup.Network reception is bad. Frequently disconnects.Old processor heats up like iron.Price is very much high.I think Realme 2 is better option than Mi.	1

The Big screen without edges is super.  I love my new phone.  Its very elegant.Overall the experience has been very good.  I would recommend to anyone this pnone	4
21298	PROs1. Awesome camera. Just love it. Both front and rear. Beats anything even beyond it's range.2. Android one. Yeah love the stock Android.3. Sound is good to hear and clear too.CONs1. I feel that battery is somewhat of an issue. Plus it's not fast charge, usually takes 1 hour to go from 10% to 100% - which is Okay, too. But in heavy usage, it drains rather quickly.2. Have to carry the audio jack connector everywhere with me, which is a concern, considered I only carry cell and some money with me in most of the places that I visit.Overall it is a great product in the price range, if you are looking for anything below 20,000 go for it.	5

However Nokia responded to complaints which reflected in their late September update. For now I ll give 3 stars, may be after October update, other issues would be resolved, let's wait	3

21315	It doesn't support fast charging	3
21316	Mi best budget phone in this price range	5
21317	It's ok I guess same funtion as Note 5	5
21318	Hi all, I really like this phone..It is so handy and looks beautiful.Though its front camera is 5MP only, but it still manages to capture remarkable pictures. Back camera captures good photos in good lighting conditions.But I'll give a pass for low light condition pictures.Takes a bit longer for charging but battery stays for long even after continous use.Overall this phone is love❤️	5
21319	performance is good,Great speed,regular update comingCamera is out standing	5
21320	Good large screen, fast and responsive	5
21321	Worst phone, will never suggest, speaker sound quality is low, battery backup is worst for this redmi product. Except front camera there is nothing in this redmi 6 pro which makes it a good phone. Over all my rating is: not worth	1
21322	Ver comfortable in using...Well done Samsung	5
21323	I feel bad to write this kind of review. However, this is the fact. Redmi is seriously facing issues with the microphones and speakers since its launch of Redmi Note 3. This issue is peeping into all those release thereafter and it is not being fixed once for all. You can see hell lot of blogs over the Internet. They say that it is the issue with their custom ROM. I don't what the developers are doing without fixing it. It seems they don't want to fix the issue. Redmi 6 Pro also has this issue. I am unable to hear or listen to any call or music.  Hence, I would say don't go for product.	2
21324	I was really surprised and very disappointed when I try to connect through Ear phones. There was a defect in the device with Ear phone socket / jack.  Even the service also very pathetic as when I approached the authorised Mi stores I have been told to keep the phone with them for more than a week to replace or re[air the defect. Never seen such service which takes long days. Please do not purchase Mi products as they are very poor in customer services.	3
21325	Amazing phone guy's.. Everything is awesome.. No heating problem... Nothing... Fast charging is missing but also charged in 1 and half hour 100%....i recommended Go for it guys...	5

21373	Seriously ✓H8X👍 100times better than Realme 2Pro👎✓BETTER BATTERY✓BETTER PERFORMANCE FASTER THAN REALME 2PRO✓BETTER OS✓BETTER DISPLAY QUALITY✓BETTER SOUND✓BETTER LOOKS✓BIG DISPLAY	3
21374	I have a constant use of the phone, with multiple aps sSo I guess battery life is not as expected. It lasts 24 hrs no doubt but I had expected more	5
21375	The phone is very good, nice performance, good quality camera, decent sound, stock android, overall good. But the main problem in this phone is battery, its the worst, though it supports fast charging, but the battery is not satisfied you. If you are a genuine camera lover then just go for it, till now in this price bracket no other phone gave such a wonderfull camera.	3
21376	Sound quality leaves a lot to be desired.	4
21377	Camera quality is really bad at this price. Specially front camera gives lifeless pictures. Battery also drains really fast. The good thing about this is phone, is it looks.	1
21378	Charger missing	1
21379	Camera is way better than A1 and all over better than I expected from Mi phones	5
21380	the product is very good it has a good camera quality and sound quality the only thing is its battery backup is not that good	5
21381	The phone is very good. But i have drop once and the screen of my phone is damaged with one scratched. Serveral times contacting the lg mobile service centre but they are telling online product it will be chargable and they dont have parts.	2

21391	Awesome 👌 👌 👌 👌 👌 👌 👌	4
21392	Pretty good smartphone for its price range, gives quite a long battery backup but the camera is one of its cons it takes pretty average pictures and concerning gaming there hasn't been any heating issues but the frame rate drops by a tiny bit when playing pubg at high frame rate and HD settings but other graphic intensive games like asphault 9 runs smoothly if your budget is under 15k then go for it in my opinion	4
21393	Mi A2 Really Brand Mobile And Good productAmazon is Brand Company	5
21394	Just the best mobile phone in this range.Premium looks.Value For Money.	5
21395	Heavy weight....and small size.  And everything is good.	4
21396	"the best phone ever i bough. the screen size is just perfect and not like big 5.5 inch. it is long, so keeping and removing from pocket is easy. crystal clear display and a confidence from manufacturer on replacing screen break even after 6 month, made me comfortable to invest 7.5K in this phone as i bough it as exchange. the other part i liked is the perfect balance of RAM and processor, which is lagging in almost every other expensive phones. there is only one draw back i noticed due to it's narrow screen, Most android app including whatsapp, righ side button hide due to narrow screen, but the issue get resolved when you rotate the phone to landscape. The issue may get resolved soon once the app is designed specifically for 18:9 screen phone and not keeping in mind for 5.5""."	5
21397	Picture quality not soo good. Screen rotation some time not properly worked.	3
21398	It's amazing, the price and the phone... Front cam is really cool,  back cam doesn't seems as a 16mp cam just OK, but gaming, display  performance are stunning.	5

21405	More than expectations	5
21406	Worst camera and model is not up to mark when compared to its own old eidtions	2

Lg not given speed internet tool in status bar &hide app lockapp and file locking.waste icon & user interface.suggestion for lg you learn from Xiaomi and vivo.less specification phone performance better than you.plz don't give fraudulent and phone jammer app like lg smart app. Only your display worthy for getting star. Performance wise poor .  interface totally give disappointent on customer with big question mark why they have again make belief on lg, your face unlock not working in low light condition less secure, no faster operations in comparison with finger print, plz don't misguide with your tag line face unlock.if not performing in all condition.features customization on app network connection &,autostart app customization.Pros...1. Good display design at budget mid range.2. Back camera justifying in this price range.3. Good design phone looks premium on hand.4.dedicated memory card slot, otg support, dual active SIM.5. Avg battery. But good for full day use for normal user.6. Phone easy to hold and operate with single hand.Cons..1. LG Home performing slowly and sluggish. App icon design size is not eye pleasing.2. Lack of Selected preloded app. Not given basic tools app , gesture .lg forcing to download third party app because their is no nreliable and performance wise poor not given basic essentials feauture setting.3. Camera is ok but dual flash light not available so camera photo come yellowish .result wise no use of flash lite4.phone back made of plastic. So it's slippery in nature. I'not liking cover. But I have to buy cove.5.phone software lg home performance wise poor l. LG smart app store run sluggish. No use.6 phone heating issue,on playing game.and in normal7. App display scaling poor.8. Lack of finger print unlock. Given face unlock.9. In this budget phone prossecer could be snapdragon 635.phone optimisation also not so good.	3

21549	I'm not sure why, the touchscreen seems to not function sometimes. I just got this phone a couple of weeks back, and my dad has already complained about the touch screen issue like 4 times. Only way to get it to work again is to restart. Anyone else facing the same issue?Can I get this replaced?	2
21550	Very good phone camera quality best better life 2 day working	5
21551	Picture quality is good i like the  sound quality	5
21552	Little bit heavy to hold (through hands).More interesting and good looking if device will become more slim.	5
21553	There is nothing such as to dislike at this budget. Really very nice mobile at such low budgets. I liked the quality of camera and pictures.	4
21554	First of all the build quality is so good it's just feels so good in hands, by the way I'm not a lover of big screens at all so the screen size is perfect.If you talk about the camera? So camera quality is good not brilliant but much better than any competitor you'll get so good selfie in low light conditions but camera gets shaken most of the time.BATTERY life is ok-ok i mean what you can expect from 3000mah its depend on your useage. I charge my phone twice a day.I bought this phone on a deal plus cashback so i got in 15.5k something so its good for that money.	4
21555	Only one this is not looking only if full screen given then no one phone is like this	5

21598	I bought this product from a showroom, but my one-star rating suggests that I am hugely disappointed by what I got. First Rs. 14,500/- is too much for the features LG Q6 has. Second, battery takes 3 hours to fully charge and discharge quickly. Though it had dual sim slot but you make call from only one sim. Don't buy this phone for more than Rs. 8,000 .	1
21599	Very nice handset.... And her features are awesome.... Really very appreciative... Very good honor	5

21605	Camera, battery back up, display, build quality are good, premium look and feel, network speed is slow compare by using my panasonic eluga ray max, honor 6x at the same time.

21655	Overall quality good but just once drop on floor screen is broken very disappointed.	2
21656	very good mobile. Thanks amazon	4
21657	Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..	3

21724	Likes: The phone as such is really great. Have been using it for 2 weeks. The speed, performance and the user interface is great.The camera both front and back are excellentDislikes: the sound sometimes fees as though the volume is not enough but still the volume will be in full.The face recognition option is not good. Most of the time it fails to recognize your face.Some features are missing, like the screen brightness is not automatic, the screen does not wake in touch or upon lifting, there is no Always On display like the ones in Samsung high end phones. But these are something that can be fixed in the software updates if Samsung thinks to do so.	5

It looks like a flagship phone for such lower price.- Best looking device for the price- Display also , best for the price- I have been pushing the device till now it has given 6 hours of Screen on time, still some juice left- Camera is great- There is a feature called night mode for night time pictures, just look at the pictures to see how good it is.- 480fps slowmotion- Selfies also look great- I wish it had was USB type C port and fast charging though- Amazon Delivery was great, delivery agent delivered early morning itself.	4

21771	Hanging issue, I am not satisfied by this mobile camera quality is very badPortrait mode does not work so I returned it back	1
21772	Few apps are showing display issues in full screen mode. Screen resolution is perfect as well as sound. Transition between apps is smooth. Battery life meets the current standards. Overall 6 pro has basic features of redmi note 4 series besides having notched screen with better display.	3

21783	Everything is good...only front camera is improve	4
21784	Brilliance, elegance and performance packed into a phone that serves the purpose just right. Go for it without any apprehensions about heating or anything. Camera is bit of a downside but with the right app you'll end up getting the perfect click. Brings back the nostalgia associated with Nokia....	5

21811	A good phone... This I am saying after 6 months of purchase... A real competitor for the Samsung's and 1+s. Butter smooth experience... Super good camera... Far better clarity than 6T... You get the difference once you zoom in the clicked pics of both the phones... Both would give you clear pics but pixel clarity matters a lot.	5

21828	Super looking... Very beautiful looking phone...Deducted star for no finger print sensor.And 1 day battery charge	4
21829	Basically needs to be plugged in full-time. A great looking phone with a great display and above-average performance at a great price (~8000-9000 during the Diwali sale) but the battery drains FAST even when on idle. Like 500mAh-in-30-minutes-of-web-browsing fast. And it's just 3000 mAh in total. I'm hoping this is an issue with my particular phone which is why I've requested a replacement (that Amazon reluctantly agreed to after a lot of hassle). I've seen better days with Amazon. Hope the replacement arrives soon and isn't as crappy as the first one!	2
21830	Hi,Don't buy, screen flickering complaint after two weeks. Since the return period is over Amazon also not helping to replace the item.Very poor.I Krishnakumar G writing this review as i am extremly disappointed with the quality of recently purchased redmi 6 pro. I have bought the same two weeks back, now suddenly the screen started flickering horizontally and vertically.I am so sad that you guys are providing cheap quality display screens for customers.

21874	Amazon will not only refuse to replace the phone which is STILL IN WARRANTY, but also wants to go over and above what the manufacturer has already decided. Will soon be taking this issue to consumrr court. Do yourself and your money a favour and DON'T EVER PURCHASE FROM THIS WEBSITE EVER AGAIN.Received a faulty product.  Screen randomly freezes and phone stops working. Amazon has refused to replace it. Don't buy this crap!	1

21876	Moto G6 purchased on 13 June 2018 is dead by now. It's not responding at all. The phone had suddenly stopped working on 20 Dec 2018 (barely after 6 months), not powering on (with last remaining charge was ~95%). This happened while travelling, leaving disconnected with family & friends. Imagine if you were in a critical situation, I wish nobody should fall in such a situation at all..I don't know if it could be resolved by the motorola service center in Kolkata, despite being within warranty!Please people, don't buy Motorola now if really want to avoid this kind of situation. Their quality products (I used 3 earlier) are no more reliable. Never buy Chinese Motorola products (US motorola was far better as per my earlier experience with Moto devices)!	1

Good set of dual rear cameras, with a nice bokeh effect, and bright colors (especially in daylight).2. The front camera has a 16Mp sensor which products great output.

21923	Lg Q6 is amazing,, its full vision display  i really enjoy it,,  and gaming also amazing view,,	5
21924	After using it for around 15 days my experience is1. Screen is superb2. Camera is really good.3. 18:9 concept is very handy and stylishBut the only sad thing is the battery.. Its just horrible.. If you are a moderate user you have to charge the phone twice or may be 3 times a day.. Phone performance is acceptable ( i am not a big gamer).. LG needs to work on its battery or else it will be a failed model (what will the awesome screen or camera do without battery?) Now I am confused whether I can take it while travelling or not!!!	1

21935	Well i was a bit skeptical when buying this phone. But it completely exceeded my expectations.The battery life is great. I've used the phone thoroughly for 2 days without charging. The picture quality is excellent. The only con if i have to say one is that it does not have a Type-c usb cable. Also the camera could've been better. But for the price range i have to day this phone is amazing	4

21946	Best phone I got android pie on November 1 weak	5
21947	I have been using this for 15 days now and easily i get 24 hours battery even when i am travelling into a low coverage area. So, Thumbs up for the battery.FULL VISION DISPLAY : AWESOMECAMERA : LG cameras have  always been good but dont expect camera to be good as a flagship.Missing fingerprint sensor is a low light but face recognition works good in day and mild low light.I am not a heavy gamer but basic apps like insta, twitter, fb work like a charm. Smooth UI, no lags and a beautiful processor.Built quality is best and is also  military grade certified.Chinese phones give better specs than this but miss the quality that this phone gives you. Make a wise decisionOverall I love this phone. Well done LG for bringing this phone at a competitive price !!!	5

21987	The Mobile phone has Full High Definition+ display which makes you feel picture coming alive. The rear camera is simply excellent and the best. Battery of 4000mAh is perfect for this mobile phone. Sound quality is much better than expected. The only concern is the front camera of 5 MP could have been made better. People who are not found of taking selfies, this is the right choice.	5
21988	My phones software has crashed within a 3 days of purchase. don't even buy this. low quality & third class phone.	1
21989	Heating issues	1
21990	everything is good but battery life is little disappointed	4
21991	Best ever for recommending others to buy.	5
21992	So good amazing phone	5
21993	Been using for a month.Pros.1. Good looks (the back cover looks bad and scratches easily)2. Fantastic display. (Neat UI)3. Not much lagging or stuck while multitasking (non gamer)4. Compact (that's really hard to find in the market. Prime reason to buy)5. Says drop proof. No problem with few drops I've doneCons.1. Heavy heating issue even without gaming. Especially when using mobile data.2. Back cover scratches and attracts fingerprints3. Face recognition is ok but fingerprint is lacking4. Average battery backup5. Below average camera department6. No notification led  Main reason for choosing: compact and looks good.  Verdict: heating issue is something very irritating. Not a camera phone. But definitely a think about option if you are fascinated by great display and looks while having a compact size.	4
21994	Decent phn	3
21995	Sound quality is improved compared to earlier version but can be improved more, picture quality and battery life is good almost same as earlier versions, selfie camera is pretty good, network reception is improved and if u are not a heavy user 450soc processor will perform much better in longer term, nice design viewing experience is good,	4
21996	It's not 4g+4g. It's only 4g+3g.It's have two speakers showing.but one only work.i think manufacturers decided that. Overall it's good..	4

22010	I had buy this phone after lot of research & consider to buy since not other phone match this specs at this range...I had ordered it on the launch Day itself & using it with last 12 Days & found very satisfied with it....Pros...1. Good look2. Notch display3. Display Quality4. Power saving modes for long Battery backup.5. Selfie camera.Cons..1. Rear camera not showing the real things enhance more than actual colour variation can easily be noticed.2. Lag some time & feel hanged at 3-4 times in just 10 Days normal use no gaming etc..Conclusion: Overall Good package at with this specs & price range..Look is awesome	4

22013	Nothing beats it at this price. Fluid usage , build  quality is amazing. No issues regarding anything . stock android is fantastic. Love it	4
22014	The productlooks amazingand easy to handle with one hand. Camera is better compared to Redmi Note 4 and it captures selfie better. The battery drains fast and it may not hold for entire day. So better to carry power bank if in case you have to use your mobile for a day.	4
22015	Red color is damm good...perfect premium look with one of the best processor.Must buy!!!	5
22016	I bought this phone when it was released back in August ,it's been 4 months ,I couldn't write a review here for some reasons idk.But out of the box the battery and screen had issues ,but the camera was excellent .Now after the pie update ,The Auto brightness is all fixed and the battery lasts much longer than before ,At first it only gave me around 4-5 ,but now after pie it last 5-6 which is great .If you haven't made the update please do it before reviewing .Enjoy the awesome moments of your life be preserved in this amazing piece of gadget .Good luck	5

22021	Cable wire not fit properly in the charger port, similarly other part of cable not fit smoothly in the phone. I bought this from Amazon but seems charger is duplicate or defective.This phone not showing me where it stored all my installed apps-- in phone memory or SD card. Neither this phone have the facility to move in either side of storage all those apps which I need so I can ensure my phone runs in good speed.I tried all possible places in Delhi NCR but not found correct tampered screen protection glass for Huawei P20 lite seems company not concentrating the spare parts, it might have possible risk in future when this phone will have any problem.	3

22043	Dont buy this phone. Picture quality very bad. It looks like VGA camera photo. Not detecting proper color .Also unlocking functionality not working properly.I don't know how this product have good review.	1
22044	I am using this product from 23rd August, 2017.  Let me tell you about this product1. Display : 8/10, the display is awesome, makes it feel like you are holding premium phone. 18:9, watching youtube and netflix is fun..2.. Hardware: 7/10, its 435 snapdragon, works well, i haven't seen any major lag in any area. The apps and website in chrome or browser opens really fast. But heating issue, it gets heated near volume button, when used continuesly.3. Ram and internal storage: 8/10, it has 3 GB ram and 32 GB internal memory expendable. plus extra slot for sd card apart from dual sim slot.4. Face recognition : 7/10, works flawlessly in proper lighting but dim light or no light it doesnt work. It has feature where you keep phone on the table as locked, pick it, and just show your face and its unlocked and ready to use... i feel that this feature is better then finger sensor, now iphone X also has these feature but they will have much advance feature and may work in low or no light.5. Camera and Video: 6/10, Not a great camera, to get clear or better picture need to use HDR, but still noise in the photos, at night its horrible. Front facing camera is good. Again as it has no flash wont get clear image at night. Camera issues may be fixed after software update. but it all depends on LG to give6. Notification 2/10, habit of seeing notification light, which u miss because no notification option.7.Dual Sim option 6/10: It has option to switch or select provider from dual sim, they dont have option where phone always ask which sim to select for calling or keep default sim for calling.. It irritates because when I have to call but  need to switch sim then, i have to click on switch button in home which may take 2-5 seconds to switch and ready to make call. with update they can move to basic version of sim1, sim2, always ask but it all depends on LG to give8. Battery: 5/10 Doesn't last for a day. worst part is in the setting it says most battery taken by system and then display. This may be fixed with software update, but it all depends on LG to give9. Software: 10/10. Phone is loaded with 7.1.1 and Confirm Oreo update.10. Overall, 7/10 because, it works well, one hand use and.. LG seriously need to update the software to fix basic issue.	3
22045	I decided to quit china products, so i was searching for a mobile with dedicated SD Card slot. Preferred Brands are Samsung, LG & Sony - Mid Range Devices. LG Q6 was launched silently in Amazon and I compared with Samsung and Sony mid range phone. I found that the Specs are good, so i decided to buy this.Phone arrived on the next day 11th August, Started exploring in the mobile. SD435 - Performance is really good, no lag found, installed many applications also. Inserted 64GB Memory card, no issues. Display is really awesome, you cannot get this kind of display in this price segment. Compared with my Existing J5 Prime and Measurement matched exactly and doesn't even felt that i m holding a 5.5 inch mobile. Fits in my hand perfectly. Test camera in door, out door, Low Light Indoor, Low Light Out Door and many conditions, Cool, camera works well even in low light. Split screen is really awesome feature, i started watching youtube and doing all the test on another window, no issues or lag works very well. Voice call clarity is very good. I have single point of jio tower and the voice is very clear which i don't get in my Xiaomi. Suddenly looked out my battery percentage, it was draining very quickly, checked battery usage, display took lot of battery and tried with multiple option to stop the battery draining, nothing works, Its draining quickly. So decided to replace the product and it was OOS, so they refunded my money. Meanwhile i was checking few  more mobiles but i am not satisfied. As soon as it back in stock i ordered and using it battery back is okay not so great.Display - 10/10Camera - 8/10Voice Clarity 9/10Design - 9/10Battery Backup- 6/10Overall this is one of best device in the price range. LG should Provide an update for battery issues.	4
22046	Excellent and best smartphone for the budget	5
22047	Its processing fast	5
22048	Camera and design of the phone are perfect	5
22049	Awesome product with awesome performance.	5
22050	Value for money.Face detection is very fast.Battery life is good.It comes with lot of pre installed MI APPS.CAMERA IS GOOD.OVERALL GOOD PHONE	5

22052	Very good phone.... Battery life is supurb	5
22053	All thing is good but displaysize is looking too small and front camera is also not good	3
22054	I have been using this device for the last 22 day and it performed to be a perfect device for me! Excellent performance and battery backup is pretty decent. Average Selfie camera. BUT the rear camera is excellent.Awesome Premium Look.The dedicated sim slot and AI camera was my point of attraction. The Fingerprint and face lock works pretty fast. Fast Charing is missing. But in this budget segment honor have included all those possible specs in the device. The Sound & the call Quality is Nice. My Rating :Display 5/5Performance 4/5Sound quality 4/5Selfie Camera 3/5Rear Camer a 5/5Battert Backup 4/5Gaming(PUBG) 4/5Call Quality 4/5Fingerprint Sensor 5/5Face Recognition 5/5But Considering, it's a budget phone I would give 5/5 for the overall device.Good Work Honor.	5
22055	Phone was good, notch also nice, only front camera was dissapointing only 5mp	4
22056	Writing this review after 2 months of usage. The outer look is awesome, delivered on date, camera quality is fabulous, loudspeaker could be better. It works like a gem. The only issue I found was some sort of heating issues when you play a game.	4
22057	excellent phone  and value for money every one should try this phone awesome phoneREAD MORE	5
22058	Absolute best go ahead and buy. Only problem is no audio jack and type c charger	5
22059	"I purchased this product on No Cost EMI option but over charged due to wrong description and details provided by Amazon. When I checked the EMI option they just show the EMI amount and details about EMI but not mentioned that ""No Cost EMI only available on HDFC Bank Credit Card"". So we careful before buy on ""No Cost EMI"""	1
22060	"this phone is the best you can get in this price bracket from LG one the best smartphone makers right now. Now coming to the phone, this phone is love at first sight you'll fall in love with it the moment you see it. It's display is the main attraction. It's probably the best display you can get in a budget and mid range phone. Second is the form factor, despite being 5.5"" display its easy to operate with one hand. It's build quality is amazing it feels solid in hand. Just go for it without a second thought. And lastly it's better than those cheap chinese xiaomi,oppo and vivo phones. LG is the best smartphone maker according to my opinion."	5
22061	Good picture quality, sound quality and satisfactory battery life.	4
22062	This is wow phone	5
22063	Display is good	5

22066	I will directly go to the cons:First Battery drains very fast, mobile has to charged twice a day, some time even thrice a day.No fast charging.Poor camera quality both.Heating issue with continues usage.Plastic back cover.Thank you...	3
22067	brillient quality but screen size small	5
22068	Good in budget phone.. But lags in PUBG game😞	5
22069	Very handy and slim, looks very classic in black. No lags or no bugs. Don't put any kinda backcase and waste money. Because these days people hardly use a phone for 1 or 2years n give it away. So make use of the slim design and the looks and enjoy the classic essentials of the phone.	5
22070	Good product. Fully satisfied with Product.	5

22074	Great budget device specially for the design , camera performance and tye battery life	4
22075	Battery Drains (Major Issue)Front Camera is poor.Rear Camera is above average.UI is awesome with Google Assistant.While charging edges heat up.No lag while playing games.(Mordern 5)Hope LG relsove this issue with updates.I have already issued replacement and Amazon replacement procedure is pathetic.	2
22076	Over all nice mobile	4
22077	I have been using this mobile from last one month.Display: 5/5.. No second thought about display.best in its class,infact LG raised a best view of display to beat its rivalryPerformance: 4/5... good for normal operations.if u are a game lover,then it may not a good option.Battery: 3.5/5... The only drawback i have observed is it's battery performance. I feel it's draining fast. Charging time also very highFront cam : 4.5 /5..cam is goodRear cam : 3.5/5..it is averageOverall rating : 4.5 /5... For me its very good.i have put nokia 6 aside to grab this one.	5
22078	Not worth for price.. It should be below 15k.	2
22079	I liked the camera alot! Like, for this price range it's just awesome. Charging is super fast but drains faster.	4
22080	It is a genuine upgrade in redmi series.The phone looks & feels premium.Slight heavy because of the battery. The camera is not an issue in this price range. Struggles in the artificial lighting.Best in range smartphone.Worth it!	4

22086	Product quality is good..Nice finishing.....Back side glossy design is amazing....Battery life up to the mark......All the features are good at this price mark....I will definitely recommend it to a friend at this price segment....	4
22087	After using for over a month, I would like to share my experience. I will be comparing with my previous phone which I am using since 3 years.Battery is excellent. I charge my phone from 5:30 - 7 am and battery remains at > 30 % even by 11 pm. That too if I use wifi hotspot all day. Only using 4G all day gives backup of over 30 hours. I was using Moto X Style whose battery drained completely by 6 hours on using 4G continuously.Rear camera is not great. Even though its 20+12 MP, pixels can be seen on zooming. This was not the case with Moto X-Style which has 21 MP camera. I expected picture quality to be atleast same if not better in Mi A2.Speakers are louder than those of Moto X Style but sound quality is better in the latter.Booting is very fast and so also the launch of apps. Haven't filled the storage with audios and videos yet and hence cannot exactly compare with Moto X Style.	4
22088	Good mobile but battery performance is poor	4
22089	Bright DisplayGood Glass DesignSelfie camera capture good photosSpeaker & Battery not up to the mark.basic earphones includedoverall Good phone	4
22090	Smart Mobile.. Beautofull look best pergormance nice.... 👍👍👍👍	4

22092	Excellent product. Looks very pretty.	5
22093	Gr8 phone..real value for money. Amazing experience. Biggest feature is Full Vision and full HD+. First in this price segment.Design is top nouch and robost build quality. Battery backup is excellent.	5
22094	Camera quality is okay campared to hype	4
22095	Front camera quality could have been little better.	4
22096	At first I hate when my front camera doesn’t work!! #iwaslikewhatthehellamazonisHowever My second order after the refund was a blessing for me!!!♡ One of the second favorite phone♠️	4
22097	This phone is not worth for 17k amount as features also not good	1
22098	I am using Moto g6 since August. It has been 3 months and I am very satisfied with all it's features.The camera quality is really good.It runs perfectly without any sort of problems like heating up fast or hanging when mutiple apps are running.The battery life is the only thing which is not up to the mark. But the turbo charger solves this problem too.It's a really budget friendly phone.	4
22099	It’s an awesome phone	5
22100	Selfie camera best buRare camera not that much goodInitially there was heating issue but now working fine	3
22101	Best price in this segment Large screen No hanging no Heating Best phone i have ever seen but low lights pictures are not expected in this price segment Overall KING OF UNDER 15K LOVE U AMAZON.IN nd LOVE U HONOR TEAM for launch a New best phone	5

No separate headphone jack, C type connector reqd for headphones and u can either charge ur phone or use headphones, both are not possible together. No slot for micro SD card, feels I should have checked all these things before buying.	1
22118	I dislike only one thing but its means lots forme redmi gives lots of in built apps that customers notwant ur inbulit apps capture loots of ram that  we have minimum amount of storage for us redmi replied same mistakes that micromax has done in past u give nothing inthe name of ram  ur lots of in built apps capture 50%ram already	2

22134	I bought this product on 8th Dec-18 from Darshita Electronics. Battery backup was so worst it is not even lasting for 10 hours after it is charged for 100%. There is no return for this product and so has to speak with Amazon technical support for help. They suggested to perform some steps over online and observe for 24 hours on the battery support. still it failed. Later when i complained, they suggested for a Mobile phone Inspection service (free of cost) which happened on 15th Dec -18. He visited home and done some setting changes and told to observe battery life.Even then the battery is not lasting for more than 10 hours. Now the option for exchange/re issue a new piece is not available online.Looking at support from Amazon now!Its been almost a month and I am not able to use this mobile.	2

22152	The best phone u can get below 20k .. I bought it for 17k but now u guys can get it for 13k..It is really awesome phone for mobile photography..But battery backup is not sufficient.. even though u can use it for almost from morning till evening .. even if u keep ur internet switched on..All games run smoothly on this phone ..I have used this phone for about 4 months ... No issues.. found..I would have given 5 stars if the battery was good..They would have kept 19k or 20k for this phone n increased the battery backup...After all this is the best phone to buy..Don't miss the chance  ... Just buy it for 13k...  4k less.	4
22153	Mi a2 is a cool phone for Rs13500. Best camera best processors average battery. Overall a good phone with some limitations like no headphone jack and sd card slot.	4
22154	Camera is worst,only notch display make it's unique look otherwise it is same as all redmi product,you cant experience any thing if you are a already redmi user	4
22155	Mostly get heated. Nd very poor camera quality.	4
22156	Smooth , fast , screen is big for games and videos no lagging problem net speed is awesome on this phone , fingerprint scanner is totally perfect the device is secure with knox , pictures are so perfect . Samsung is brand and its valuable in this price this is not any China brand will provide you quality and everything in 6000 and after one year china brands show its capabilities will lag and who bought those brands have change sets after one year or 1.5 years that is the different between china brands and Samsung i am using this brand since 8 years and i am totally happy . WHENEVER I BUY PHONES ITS ALWAYS FROM SAMSUNG AND ITS AMAZING EXPERIENCE I BUY PHONES FROM EVERY 2 TO 3 YEAR OF USING MOBILES FROM SAMSUNG .	5

22166	Poor front and rear camera result, can not stabilise picture, Bad bettery life, bad display result, colours of display also very hue, over all bad experience with this phone so dont waste 15k, go for less than 10k also notch display available in other phones.	1
22167	A perfect durable smartphone, so I gave 5 star to durability.It was gift to my father and as I expected he is so happy with Nokia 6.1. Even I like the phone the most because you feel so good in your hand well built and again so durable device.	4
22168	Good daddy	5
22169	i bought the phone the day it was launched on amazon, i will divide the reviews in pros and cons.proswell built, looks like a premium phonethe display is gorgeous, makes u look at the screen again and againcall quality and speaker quality is decent, no call drops noticedthe lg user interface is good.battery life is as expected on lg devices which is good, the phone is powered by a 3000 mh battery which gives one day of use, there is still little juice left at the end of dayconsno fingerprint scannerface unlock is there, but does not work all the timeits slightly on the heavier sideno fast charging providedsnapdragon 435 is decent however a higher spec processor was more welcome	3
22170	bought only 4 mnths back, now display is not working.. now you have to run to service centres  for repair..  bad luck))) think not reliable, not used the phone so much..	1
22171	Great phone, its Android ONE so, always upto date OS.. One star less for battery, they should have had a bigger battery..  I guess battery is never enough! :)	4
22172	Cam quality is very bad	4
22173	No one dislike	5
22174	Pictures quality good.	5
22175	Third class mobile phone. Very Slow, hang most of the time. No theme app, No music app, no photo app.Taking too much time to preview/upload Photo.My suggestion please don't buy MI A2. MI's wrost mobile phone ever.	1

22180	With in 2 months of purchase I had issue with charger cable. But this was replaced under warranty. So now it's working fine	4
22181	Earphone is not give	4
22182	It's like the Redmi note 5 but it has three slot insertion, Notch display, dual rear camera and 5.84 inches of display slighty smaller than Redmi Note 5 5.99 inches but it looks more beautiful than Redmi Note 5. The Chip set is the same snapdragon 625. Overall 5 star rating. I love this phone	5
22183	Very good mobile 👍Picture quality and sound clarityDisplay of text not comfortable camre with earlier models of MI redmi	4
22184	Nice just now receive the phoneREAD MORE	5
22185	Got this Mobile under exchange for a bargain. SD625 with 3GB RAM N 32GB ROM. Great 4000mH battery that lasts 2 days easy with normal usage. Camera far better than my previous Moto n screen is to die for. Interface is smooth n hope they provide Android pie 9.0 upgrade for this phone. Overall excellent buy.	5
22186	I like this phone it's depth effect is so amazing	5
22187	Nice notch display camera is cool	5
22188	Great phone at this price	5
22189	Good phone with value for money above all made in india	5
22190	Battery getting drained out in 6-8 hrs after full charge	2
22191	Nice phone , look very nice in hand ,thanx to full vision display	5
22192	The phone is like budget phone sometime it's lags & mi doesn't give a better service after purchase & all of that the phone is disaster in battery life	1
22193	Pros:1. Look wise good.2. Nice display.3. Budget phone.Cons:1. Battery is not good.2. Could be with finger print sensor.3. Heating problem while charging.4. Could be with fast charger.	3
22194	Only camera is goodDesign is very badBattery life half dayDisplay quality average	2
22195	Super phone in price, Betty is fantastic, high camera quality, All fancetion ar avelable, desply quality 1080 mp, sound quality	5
22196	Got a used product with seal Brocken	1
22197	Don't waste your money for full vision displayIts just start heating in 10 minutes of HD video watching or while using cameraAnd its battery backup is very pooreven you can't pass a single day without charging it again because of its older snapdragon 435 processor .Only display and speark is good.	2
22198	don't buy I am playing pubg hitting issue and camera & display poor quality only for battery backup okREAD MORE	1
22199	Best smartphone one	5
22200	Great built quality and display at this price. No lagging or heating issues. Sound quality and selfie camera could be better.	5
22201	Good worth of cost	4
22202	Looking gret and sexy disignEverything is good but camera is average	4
22203	The Redmi 6 Pro, is not uptown the expectations set. The device gets heated up while charging and played videos, battery drains fast. The sound  quality is pathetic, until 75% of sound bar, you don't hear anything. The phone vibrates at speakers. Its not pairing up with devices via Bluetooth, there is a lag while browsing through. Over all its a below performance product not worth the price.	1
22204	I liked the battery life of the phone very much. Just charged for 30 Mins, am able to use it foe more than 6 hrs (WiFi is on). The thing which i felt drawback is the earphone slot. We can either use ear phone or put the phone in charge. So I feel during the travel it may be inconvenience. Rest of that everything is fine.	4
22205	Excellent in this price	5
22206	I'm using this phone for last 4 months. This phone 5 star but I have given 4 star because when pay 20k your expectation becomes high.Now coming to pros and cons.Pros:1. Build quality - I will give 5/5. This phone looks very premium and you will feel it in your hand.2. Camera - For front camera it's 24MP camera and does very good job in selfie 4/5.Rear camera is OK, but don't compare with one plus and any other Samsung's premium phone overall it's good. But as I said in range of 20k expectations are high so 3/5.3. Performance - I'm not too much game lover, so I can't comment much about gaming performance but overall performance is excellent no lag. So 4/5.4. Display : Full HD + display which is very good and color tune is also decent. Although its common in all similar price range phones but its display is premium as compared to realme or Mi.Cons:1. Till now I have only one cons that is its 3000 MAH battery which should be at least 3500 MAH but still it is one day lasting.	5
22207	Just show off honor once again in 8x.AI is too good. Nice Recommend for honor lovers. Bt in a price line realme u1 is better than 8x	5
22208	battery problem	1
22209	Outstanding screen. Fluid UI. Easy one hand operation.	5
22210	Excellent photo by LgYou for money	5
22211	Best thanks to Amazon.	5
22212	Highly premium feel with this phone at a very good price.The photos are superbThe milky whitish screen appearance is so pleasing u feel like looking at it.Menu from stock Android is good. Didn't feel absence of 3.5mm Jack since adaptor is readily available in the package.Overall a wonderful upgrade for me from my previous phone.	4
22213	front camera is only 5 MP so if you want a perfect selfie then go for Redmi Y2 16MP front camera	3
22214	Over all phone is good, camera, picture, speed and sound everything is good.	4
22215	Nice Camera,battery	5
22216	best mi mobile i have ever seen	5
22217	It's an outstanding product with good rear camera, nice battery backup, premium looks & very good screen resolution. Better than competition at this price point.	5
22218	I brought this phone on  oct 11 2018 after 2 months Sensor is not Working and music volume I'm getting very low.I don't like this phone and irritated	1
22219	Yes..this is smart mobile for smart user ...LG interface is very good, touch quality smooth , screen is beautiful and Crystal clear...smooth working...Go if you like Good looking mobile phone.	5
22220	Severe heating issue !! Got the refund from Amazon after one replacement.	1
22221	nice mobile	5
22222	All are average	4
22223	The feel of the phone is really premium. The USP of this phone is the 18:9 screen with superb brilliance. The screen's adaptive brightness works the best among all phone in bright daylight. The perfect size and weight are also theplus points.But the list of cons is really big.Lack of FP sensor pinches for this price point.Primary Camera quality is just average. Front Camera is poor. Expectations from LG for Camera are high but no good feature here.Battery management is very poor. Drains quite fast on net or wifi usage. No fast charging also provided. Full charging takes a very long time appx 3 hrs.No notification LED is present, which almost all basic phones have.So basically, moderate users who wud like to have a premium looking phone with no concern for Camera wud love this phone. But more than average users will not enjoy this phone at all.For me looks and battery were the main concerns, battery problem is too irritating... So have finally asked for a replacement from Amazon.	3

22229	Giving my review after using it for one week.Pros :Rear camera is awesome in this price range. Sound quality is  excellent.Battery backup is average. Charging takes lesser time compared to mi note 4/3.Cons:Front camera is not upto the required mark. Images are bit noisy and produces not required white effects.Price is little higher compared to realme 2 and realme 2proFace lock takes time little longerOverall phone is good. So 4out of 5	4
22230	Selfie camera got damaged and sound is not well enough, exchange period is too long	3

22241	Picture quality & sound quality is good battery life is average	5
22242	average camera, good looks , awesome battery life .. overall good experience using this phone	4
22243	Good sound ,good battery backup ,	5
22244	camera quality is worse when it come with the brand LG	1
22245	Its been almost 3 weeks since I am using this phone. The day I opened it I fell in love with the design and the elegance. The 18:9 screen display is awesome. Also it's ergonomics is very well designed and user friendly. For example, you get the sim details on the home page itself with info such as calls made, messages, data consumed, switch ON or Off button. There are couple of more features like this. The rear camera is fine in good light, but may not be so good in dull lightings.The front camera is good. I can feel some heating issue with the phone, but observed it very rare and the heating did not bothered me much. I can talk more on the heating issue after another few months of usage, but right now it is fine. The face recognition feature is smooth, but of course needs decent light to function.Overall I would conclude that this is a good buy in the price range it is offered by Amazon. LG has done a superb job with the display and the overall features.	5
22246	Premium look below 20000Awesome battery backupStunning display 6.5 inch little bit big in handsCamera is over saturated but it's look good for photosMuch more better than my previous phone huawei p20 lite and samsung j8Love it.	5
22247	Must buy in the 15k-20k range.	5
22248	It's a good phone if you want a different experience.Phone is too light to the point where it feels like a replica.Though the camera boasts lots of pixels, the picture aren't that good, they are not bad but it could've been better.Otherwise the phone and android experience is smooth. I got a little lag only while setting up the phone which is normal.	4

22322	After using it for 6 months here is my reviewConsSad battery lifeVery average battery lifeAverage cameraNot a gaming phoneProsIt is fastIt lasts a day on heavy usageHandles all the abuse.VerdictIt won't last a year and will need replacing in around 15-18 months.	4
22323	Worth for money.	4
22324	Sound quality is OK,Battery back up excellent but camera is not at par with mobile that is available at this price.So whoever is fond of selfie and camera ,I will say look for other phone in this price range.	3
22325	"The first thing I though when I opened the box was : ""This is huge, it might be heavy"". But no, it was light weight.I turned it around and the dual finish was awesome.Two camera looked like eyes of Minions :DNext I turned on the display and I see that blue light from one end to other. That was massively huge and bezels were almost not there.I've always loved the way PhoneClone takes the backup from other phone. Honor FTW for this.Moving in to the system and first thing I checked was the camera. Loved the clarity of the pic and accuracy of the Bokeh was good. What I love about dual-camera in honor is that I can fix aperture after the click.As it has been just a day so cant say much about battery but all in all REALLY LOVING THIS FOR NOW..."	5

22331	Well the device in itself has improved considerably after Android Pie update, specially the battery life, which very very average before to say the least.Overall a decent device, but for at this price point the device in looks and features a bit dated.In short, it's a device for the android purist.	3

22363	Very good phone. Impressive battery life. Another excellent affordable phone from Xiaomi	5
22364	Battery is draining is very fast and camera quality very poor	3
22365	Nice product value for money.. but getting accessoires is very difficult. I am not completely happy with this product due to the Cast feature not working with my smart tv. Except this every thing is fine.	5
22366	Beautiful smartphone	5
22367	Apart from battery everything is great.Mi should give at least 4000 battery	5
22368	Bakwasssss	2
22369	Rear dual camera good with portrait mode but portrait doesn't work on front facing from the begin . Battery life is good & sound quality is too good.	4
22370	very bad camera	5
22371	I will give this phone 4 out of 5 stars. I bought this during SALE in around Rs. 11,500 and this rate is justified for this. This is an awesome model by LG and in this price it is very harsh to expect features and technicalities like high end mobiles. People are judging negatively and givings 1 or 2 stars because criticising something comes free of cost. You want great camera, finger print scanner, 850 Snapdragon,,,,,Just Go And Buy Samsung Galaxy Note 8. But you don't have money for that. STOP writing negative reviews about a good phone. LG Q6 is a worth buy and a must buy in this range. And by the way......my LG Q6 Face Recognition working fantastically nice and smooth :)	4
22372	Looks good n light weight... Worth for money	4
22373	Q6 is really awesome especially the full vision display.Really a stand out product among the present midrange smartphones.Camera as usual from LG is simply superb.Facial recognition unlock feature is something noteworthy.Decent batterylife and handy. Its really worth for this price.	5
22374	Using this phone from last 15 days. It's nice and compact phone. Last week my friend said to that his Samsung smartphone is best but we compared both the phones. My Honor 8X wins over his expensive Samsung smartphone. It's great moment for me. Love Honor.	5
22375	Worst product, When received first time phone that time i was getting bug report in every app and alternate days. And amazon replaced that product, Once replacement product received and switched on first thing then i was receiving video call call option, when i have updated the phone video call option was not visible. I have contacted with mine customer care and they did troubleshooting by clearing data of contact and dialer and all erosion on, then i was getting option again. But today again the same issue started and not getting video call option. Not able to do clear data every day	1
22376	Excellent in terms of quality	5

22379	What a phone...its a complete all round performanceDesign and build quality superbCamera is good specially the front camera. It is better than MiA1.Android One is just better.I have been using MiA1 which runs on Android one.But the one in Nokia which my brother is using has certain few minor features added which are missing in MiA1 even though both runs on 8.1. FM radio is there.There is no such issue in performance. LCD display is too good.As it runs on LCD generally it consumes less ch...READ MORE	5

22385	Looking very nice but many costumer review cemera is boring . . . . . . . . . .	4
22386	This phone is one of the most beautiful phone right now.The screen looks amazing too.Fast enough and the selfie camera is good.Even the main camera is good too,but there's an issue of over saturation..Hope it gets fixed with the next update.Also the unavailability of image stabilization is another let offAnd please use a quality earphone and do justice to the magnificent stereo surround system, it's top notch..U will have a brilliant experience playing PUBG on this phone..Disappointed with not having type-c charging..But it's still fast for the battery..Took me just 2 hours to charge from 0-100..Overall the phone is a real beast among the mid range section and has the most beautiful design and powerful processor+good AI camera and a huge screen size and what not..	5
22387	Good display, camera. Battery backup is good as running on Android one, still Battery could have been better as it's only 3010mA. Loudspeaker is loud but sound quality is not that good. Lodness is very low when using headphones through USB C to 3.5mm convertor, almost need to keep volume to 70% to hear.	4
22388	Best out of the box and perform in every situation battery, camera everything must buy	4
22389	If you are Fan of redmi phones, this model will dissatisfy you. I have redmi 1s, note 4, 4i, redmi 5 pro and purchased this now.Totally disappointed with the picture quality of this model.

22451	Amazing phone. Good feel and build quality. The pictures are good to be shared on social media but not great when watched on a big screen. (TV).The OS installed is very stable and no lag /delay, the additional features or shortcuts provided by huawei are very useful and handy to use.Portrait mode photos are much better than other phone in this price range.Only drawback I can think of is that the phone is very slippery nd little difficult to get a grip in single hand usage.	5
22452	I've purchased it before 2 months.but now it shows a big problem of hanging. I'm not satisfied with this	3
22453	I am very disappointed with the phone due to received damaged phone edge near rear camera up side I don't know how it's possible.	3

22455	A really good phone. VFM deal made sweeter by Amazon exchange.	5
22456	This phone has not been given basics which is battery and 3.5mm jack. After using this phone for a month I feel like left alone from this world.It's like a beautiful building on a very weak foundation. How many pictures would you click when you have serious battery issues.I normally don't write reviews but this phone has pissed me off.It's my fault that I didn't read the reviews before buying this. Thanks to the last time of Diwali sale	3
22457	Handy, very good camera, fantastic performance and good battery life	5
22458	good phone. Metal body heating a bit but good phone to handle.	5
22459	Very good build quality, slim and fit. The best thing is that, the gorilla glass will gives a premium segment feel.	5
22460	Worst camera quality by xiaomi. Its like vga camera. Sound quality is also bad. Mobile Network connectivity has problem also, in my previous motorola phone network was good at same location but this phone not getting network.I don't recommend to buy this phone.	1
22461	Picture quality not so good.	5
22462	The battery life in not so good and it should have headphone 3.5mm	4
22463	MI phones are not available offline hence it is not possible to know about the colour before receiving it and we are stuck up with a bad looking phone due to Amazon policy.Anyone can see the difference in colours, shown in website, on phone box and actual device.Bigh disadvantage of buying online at Amazon.in	1

22473	Battery backup could have been better. Front camera lags while taking multiple shots.	4
22474	I like this mobile but  memory card slot is not working	4
22475	Battery - small but fills up quickly.Camera - good but needs more software update.Performance - Great at this price, 636 SD sucks.Quality - looks premium, feels premium.UI - It definitely sucks, no doubt. Got a launcher installed so, it's fine.Cons - UIand some software bugs.	5
22476	I am using this phone since 15 days, upto now I don't find a single problem	5

22490	There is nothing I have to say about MI, They are my best brand on everything. So it juz awesome.As I have been on Note series, slipping into Redmi Series made a little difference, but Its good to go with this price tag.	5
22491	Battery is work like 3000 mahFront and back camera is lowSound quality is average	3
22492	Amazing phone and cost effective. Camera is awesome. Face detection is some what slow. Worth buying.	4
22493	Not up to the mark in this price range	2
22494	Nice phone at its price.Everything is good. Mainly the screen and the camera quality is just great. (Given some sample shots)And build quality is good enough.Face unlock is also pretty fast.Only have sone heating problema.	5
22495	Look is best&unique. Comfortable use.battery life best.sound quality is also best.	5
22496	After using this phone for 4 months the display developed a yellow line on top right side of screen. Visited service centre and they said you need to give this device to service centre and will be returned after 10 days. So after sales service is really Poor.	4
22497	I  am mi fane but this model very bad camera quality and sim slod one time one 4g total lost money	1
22498	Useless phone, no ample features, heating issue and battery drains very quickly. Pathetic.	1
22499	Like it's display far better than vivo v9	5
22500	Best phone, build quality and unique deaign.Better choice you can buy...Processos is 435 but very good performace.	5
22501	Very good phone. Look also good at this price totally very comfortable mobile	5
22502	For now i would say this is outdated and there are much better options out there.simply put.no fingerprint scanner.not a good camera at all.very vibrant display though.Sleek build and such a beauty to hold in hands but heats like hell,not usable without a back cover seriously.Average battery.go for atleast 4000 amps or buy asus phones those are just nailing it.What elseback panel prone to scratches you wont even notice might appear.Very good looking no doubt such a beuatiful shape premium display like no other.lg is lg.but this is defenitely not a good buy at 12 k.there are much powerfull cpu and gpu available with larger displays good ram management and offcourse battery..still wanna go for it take my word its not dissapointing at all.its a very responsive phone and such a beauty to look at.battery drains a little too quick,so what always have backup.i keep two phones all the time so not a problem for me.Bringing to your notice face unlock is accurate but it wont work most of the time in most light conditions.so usually youre entering your phone with a passcode or pattern.	3
22503	All the features are best in this phone but battery life should be more.	5
22504	Not a good phone except for that brilliant display. Since I am not an avid mobile user, I am okay with that slight heating problem and short battery life problem. Since this phone is dedicated mostly for incoming calls, lack of Fingerprint sensor also doesn't bother me much. But even after all software updates, it is not possible for me to select 4G+3G combination. Only available combination is 4G+2G. Remember that even cheaper phones give 4G+4G.	3
22505	First impressions were awesome after using it for one week i had got all pros and cons main cons were1)Light heating near volume buttons but they are not  so high that u cant hold it sometimes u cant even noticeable2)camera struggles in low light but during light it takes decent photos3)charging speed4)not much useable face recognition bcoz  at nyt times it cant workPros1)display everyone will fall for it2)built quality trust me u will even not buy a cover to feel that in hand fell3) customisable UI which i left  like my old oneplus2 u can get themes have app drawer change icons fonts etc4)i had read comments about battery but im getting around 5hours:30 mins of  battery and no such high battery drain issues . Morning when i wake up only 2-4 %of battery is used which is normal  or it might be due to my latest updates in which peoblem might have been solved5)have to appreciate lg which haven't skipped any sensor in this like Samsung does in this range of phones6) no lags and its stable but not as optomised as apple5)Not for heavy gamers but it can handle every game but takes a 5-6 secs more than other phones to load thats itConclusion:if u want brand and after sales services then go for this or want everything on phone like fringerprint etc and dont care about using china phone buy china phone	4

22540	value for money ...but camera quality not that much good	4
22541	Good phone. I never used like this . Full vision display and its designs are very nice and perfect. And also having face unlocking system. Its awesome feature in this phone . I really love this mobile LG Q6	5
22542	It is over a month I purchased this phone and using this since, Here is my experience with this buddy:Boons:1. Ergonomics:  Was worried about its size, but found it very pleasant on hand as width is optimal and has very slim profile, although one may need little deep pocket for keeping in normal trousers, and gives some discomfort when you use denim trousers. Soft case provided along with package is plain but good enough to keep your phone safe.2. Battery: Having battery of 3010 mAh battery gives little fear on battery life. But in practice it is well compensated by energy efficient processor. One can happily use this phone 3-4 hours and will find remaining battery life is still around 50%.3. Sound: Cristal clear sound without any distortion or noise is one of the big gift this phone gives.4. Processor: Snapdragon 660 is real workhorse for phones of this range, nothing can beat it for next 6 months at this price point. Having 4 GB of RAM enables this phone to perform hassle-free while Google updates are going at background.5. Camera: Very high quality pictures irrespective of the lighting condition, did not notice any noise in the image produced by this buddy.6. Google One: Having a phone having all the necessary software without any bloat ware is bliss. One is not going to face any lag or heating issue for normal loads. I found it very user friendly after couple of days of familiarization with its atmosphere.7. Fingerprint Scanner: Very fast, but I switched to pin number as per expert advice.Banes:1. No Factory Installed Screen Guard: It is biggest bane for me, this phone has. Getting right screen guard with right dimensions is tough, and tougher is to fix it with company provided soft case.2. Lacking Fast Charger: The phone supports Quick Charge 4.0+, and I got a normal 10W charger. What is this, like running a sport car on Coal Fuel? Great disappointment.3. Missing Headphone Jack: The phone comes along with adopter but somehow I am not happy about it.4. Missing dedicated Memory Slot: One have to compromise in this area, but OK, they want you to use Google drive instead.Overall Rating 8/10PS: Self is mid-light user in general, weekend usage is somewhat heavy. Mostly use this device for You tube, net surfing and chatting, but no gaming.	4

22580	Phon is good but not discount avalable	5
22581	"Just Bought this phone a month ago... I know this is not a high end flagship phone, but for what I get it's price I am very Happy.However there is something I wish they would do different (without significantly affecting it's price.. I think),1. The Camera Hump is one if the biggest I have seen on a smartphone, why couldn't they just make the whole whole a bit thicker, to level up the camera hump (this phone is VERY thin, a millimeter or more couldn't hurt it's design)... that way they could have put more battery capacity a bit bigger (the 3000mah is a BIT too small for 6"" screen operation)2 The proximity sensor is a joke, often after ending a call, Ia would get random apps or setting opened due to my skin touching the screen doing calls... they could have made it a bit better for this kind of price3. Adaptive brightness is quite bad for a phone at this price range, so I just use manual brightness setting.4. And for a few rupees more, I wish they put in NFC, Because I use NFC alot on my previous phone.for proximity sensor and adaptive brightness is waaay better on my previous Nokia Lumia 730 phoneBut Overall I am happy with this phone, the Camera Is Great, no lagging so far."	4
22582	Cool phone love it	5
22583	Mi a2 is awesome mobile and camera quality is very nice	5
22584	Good phone for daily usage	4
22585	Superb Quality.Nice product....My expectations with this product is satisfactorily.	5
22586	Battery 1 backup camera is fine not better than note 4, screen feels awesome.... Doesn't hang... Poor packaging frm Amazon plz check ur product... Software lags....	2
22587	Very Nice phone is.. Look awmse.. Display quality excellent. Sound quality is good. Amazing phone Huawei P20 lite	5
22588	after two months of use.. battery drain fast.	3
22589	Value for money... Nice mobile in such a affordable price.	4
22590	Great phone at great price loved it......	5
22591	Not worthy for this price	3
22592	Extremely HappyAll 5 stars	5
22593	Full vision display with good features	5
22594	Performance quality is poor.	1
22595	Honor 8x is a Looker. I can't get my eyes off it. Especially the blue colour variant looks Stunning. Thanks to Amazon for super fast 1 day delivery.Now Let's talk about the phone.Pros :1- Phone isn't heavy and can be manageable with one hand. The back glass is shiny and solid build quality, feels premium in hand.2- Great display quality, vibrant colors and superb viewing angles. Awesome multimedia experience.3- Though it got 3750mah battery, for me it lasted more than a day like heavy usage playing games, Volte calls and using all social media apps on 4G network.4- 20MP AI dual camera clicks superb pictures with great details. Portrait mode does a good job with decent edge detection. 16MP selfie shooter gives awesome selfies with lots of modes to choose from. After all cameras does decent job at this price segment.5- Speaker is Loud and clear, call qaility is excellent and supports dual Volte.6- Latest Hisilicon kirin 710 is super fast, performance is great, no lags and GPU Turbo boosts the gaming experience.So performance wise phone is outstanding.So my Verdict is Honor 8x is one of the best Allrounder under 15k.  don't think twice just buy it. We can't expect more at this price segment. Honor 8x The Battle King For the Brave.	5
22596	😎	5
22597	After 4 Days usage this is my HONEST observation1)Phone having excess heating problem even u play YouTube just 2-3 minutes or just start playing game ( even candy crush) within 2-3 min. Right side grill below sim and sd-card tray excessively heated.....2) and battery is 3000 Mah but it hardly give 7-8 hours backup even on moderate(below average) usage in that 7-8 hrs. I dont used this mobile for receiving even single call and still battery drains completely in that short period.and most amazing part you can not return it,just roam around authorized service centers and problem is still there.....Amazon is worst in returning Poor performing products, there is no option of return product that fall in this type of category(Heating/battery draining).....feels cheated by AMAZONSo guys don't go by advertising....think logically before buying	1
22598	I like this phone features	5
22599	Phone is ok. But specs wise, mi note has the same and cost lower. Face recognisation is cool, bit if light is less face recognisation. does not work. Overall phone is good. No LED indication.Amazon rocks.	4
22600	"I really like the phone, this my first non flagship phone. After using iphone 7, s8 thought about going for brand like MI. Have buyed mi band 2 few years back and was impressed by it durability.Things which i didn't like:brightness sensors: its really bad feel bit pain on eyes if kept in auto. So, currently i am using it on manual adjustment. hopefully mi will improve it through software update. but i do like there night mode helps me read at night.picture quality: I would say its above average if compare with flagship but yes its better compared to its own category.sound: quite impressed by the loud sound which indeed i was looking for but at max volume quality goes down a bit.Battery: well I am not really into gamming or selfies. my major workload is either social app or emails. (emails means hell lot of emails i have to reply to atleast 100-150 emails daily) So battery for me is 1d 12hrs. but this could be different for you if you are into gamming.Network: I must accept it that this phone picks network and internet far better than flagship, I wonder why??the other thing i like about this is unlike like other MI product where there put flash sale fpr few seconds and then say ""sold out"" this product is available thoughout the amazon sale. This is quite disappointing part of MI thinking that by showing your product is ""sold out"" will make your product looks more interesting. Dear Mi stop doing these foolish things today's buyers aren't fool they see the things and check the product on different site. so plz stop the childish move.and last but not least ! its really fast. you can compare speed of this phone close to a flagship phone."	4
22601	Reami 6 pro best smartphone low value but high features	5
22602	I just love this handset	5
22603	I loved it.. camera quality  is good but not best battery life is great..but prize wise may b it can b more better ..	5

22606	Battery consumption in little bit more	4
22607	Camera quality is amazing. And also sound quality & battery life is as expected. No hitting no hanging... I loved it....	5
22608	Pros that sets this phone apart from others are:4000mhA battery, separate SD card slot(not hybrid), easy for single hand usage due to small form factor, IR blasterCons: Bit heavy, maybe due to the large battery, no dual 4g/volte support simultaneously	5
22609	MI 6 Pro Sound is too good.	4

22614	Loved it for the Smartest Looks..Absolutely Stunning.. Totally Premium Looks in a Neat, Sleek package..with Good Performance too..Great Deal price of 12990/- for a 15000 phone. -*-*-*-*-* WAIT FOR THE BAIT -*-*-*-*-*Pros & Cons: After 4 days of usage (I'm currently using S6-Edge 2.1Ghz Octa Core, 3GB + 64GB & Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus, octa core, 3GB + 16GB)YES- Powerful Engines Packed in Sleek Package. Quite fast for normal daily usage. Doesn't lag or hang.  (Compared with S6 Edge (2.1 Ghz Octa Core + 3GB + 64GB) & Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus (1.5Ghz Octa Core + 3GB + 16GB)YES- 1.4Ghz Octa Core + 3 GB Ram + 32GB Internal + 256GB Expandable (I tried with Sandisk slim 2TB portable hdd which was smooth as butter, with no lags and hangs).YES- Dual 4G SIMs with Dedicated Memory Card Slot. Both sims 4G compatible-No need to swap 1st & 2nd sims.YES- Stunning Looks & Great Screen-FULL HD.YES- Premium features like 2 tap sensor for screen wake up.YES- Both Cameras are nit soooo gr8 but Quite Good.No- Fast charging. Very Slow charging-Almost 2.5 hours for full charge.No- Finger Print Scanner. Only Face Recognizer which can be tricky and very less secure. Any1 can activate even when you are asleep.No- LED NotificationNo- Platic Back Plate-Gives a cheap look comparing to the front.No- Speaker Very Good But Not Loud Enough.YuK- The speaker is at the backside instead of the the lower side, which is the Latest Trend & Tech.Acceptable:Heating issues are normal for an Octa Core phone.Battery OK,ish for a days use.. Could have been better. But would have increased the thickness & Weight.	5
22615	Good Phone, 5.5 Full HD+, nice look, one hand use, face unlock sensor, no need to press any button for lock/unlock, nice features.But one thing is that its battery should be increased to LG, minimum battery should be 4000 according to today's use.	5
22616	Picture quality is extent . Berry life is low. Sound is good	3
22617	Good product good quality battery full day in higher use only hybrid slot is disadvantagePhone is good quality	4

22623	bad camera.....	1
22624	The best handsetcomes in  5.5 inches full vision display  and best in class 435  Snapdragon Prosesser it's amazing phone  in Best phone ever overall best performance	5
22625	Amazon service was fast got delivered in 2 days. Brand like Mi never failed to deliver such great products as well as this also a great product from Mi. But it didn't create and over hype like Mi A1 .Performance is top notch because of Snapdragon processor and stock android.Battery Backup is also great well optimised software and hardware	5
22626	After 2 day Usage writing this review:1. Stunning disaply2. Solid build quality,Premium finishing3. easy one handed operate4. no lag with 30 + apps4. good software from LG5. Camera quality is good in light, ok in low light6. Decent battery back upCons:1. Face recognition wont work in low light2. No notification LED3. No fast charging4. No NFC	5
22627	Really good phone at this price	4
22628	This phone is much better than Redmi Note 5 PRO, just because it doesn't have MIUI. I loved MIUI for most part of my life but it has turned out to be shady showing ads everywhere it can. With Android One this one has stock android.The camera is much better at this price range, portrait mode works good.Snapdragon 660 AIE is able to handle all task as well as games very smoothly.Battery life is good, lasts approx 2 days with decent usage (messages, whatsapp, music, data on while reqd) and about 8.5 hours with heavy usage (Asphalt 9, PUBG, whatsapp, music, 4G turned on all the time). Fast charging is not as great as OnePlus but you'll get a good charge in about 30 mins.Not having a 3.5 mm jack is kind of bummer but it you'll be using it as your daily driver the keep the usb c to 3.5mm dongle (included in the box) attached to your earphones.	5
22629	Appearance is good...But not lucid yo use.Would not recommend,since user friendly phones ,better than this are available at the same price.	3

22634	Poor Battery performance, phone heats too.	2

22655	1- How could LG miss out adding a feature as crucial as biometric authentication(fingerprint sensor). But then, from another point of view, the LG Q6 offers something that no other competitor is offering.To begin with, the LG Q6 does feature ‘Face Recognition’ to compensate for the missing fingerprint sensor. LG says, it’s more convenient to unlock the smartphone with your face rather than typing out passwords, drawing a pattern or using your fingerprint. Even the upcoming Apple iPhone 8 is rumored to ditch the TouchID fingerprint sensor in favor of face recognition.2-  Now, coming to the second bit – edge-to-edge displays are now gearing up the pace. For this year’s flagship smartphones, edge-to-edge displays has been the trend – and we’ve seen that with the LG G6, the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8+. Later this month, Samsung will be launching the Galaxy Note 8, whereas Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 8 next month.3- Today, people want larger displays on their smartphones, but in a compact form factor. By shaving off the capacitive Android navigation buttons, you do get a larger screen real estate to enjoy watching movies, music videos, web browsing experience and playing games. But wait, there’s more – the LG Q6 comes with metal body made from strong 7,000-series aluminum to offer military grade durability.4- Heating issues: Have you ever seen the Temperature Warning on the iPhone before, saying “iPhone needs to cool down before you can use it”, appearing seemingly out of nowhere? If you’ve ever bought & used iPhone outdoors on a hot sunny day for too long, you probably have.You are cool with your iphone heating problems but why not with LG Q6??SOLUTION: GO & BUY AIR CONDITIONER ASAP IF YOUR LG Q6 HEATS IN YOUR ROOM 😛😜	5
22656	Front camera not good, sound also very low, disappointed with the performance.Worst service by amazon as the product is not returnable, will not use amazon any more, better use flipkart as the option for return is available	1
22657	Full Display gives you amazing feel. Looks of phone is so beautiful !! EMUI is so user friendly, amazing product from HONOR !Thanks to Amazon for the excellent service!!	5
22658	Phone was very nice, so comfortable, front camera is good, and good quality, battery is ok, it has little heating issues, overall it's a good phone	5
22659	The mobile is good as per price. But  one more thing MI Protect to be introduced  for interested customer through amazon	4
22660	Overall This is Best for 15k Compare to Any Other Brand Phone Like Realme, MI, Asus, Nokia, Motorola etc.	4
22661	It is in amazing condition, package is also very good.	5
22662	Picture quality too bad	4

22668	This phone is just awesome I am not a gamer, so this phone works too awesome for me and for the same reason battery life is also good, I charge 2 times in 3 days with normal youtube, browsing and social apps...	5

22682	Awesome phone sab kuch value for money but camera can't impress me but good phone value for money I love this phone	4
22683	Product was fine	4
22684	I got this phone in first online sale for 17K, and am ready to post my views. This is one of the best phones in all aspects in below 25K category. In camera results, very few ultra costly phones might be able to beat it marginally. Looks, feel, response, speed, screen reproduction, sound all are outstanding.But best feature is its camera. I have used it in almost all modes and light conditions and results have been pure bliss. I tried zoom in video and it captured far objects with excellent clarity and enough detail.However to make it a slim phone, MI has compromised on battery size. Even on this new phone, battery is just about enough for a medium level day-long use. But despite this one limitations, I am very happy with this gadget.	5
22685	Quality Product from Huawei.This is only phone available in this price range with notch and superior class build qualityCamera is the plus point in this phone with bookeh mode and motion capture photographyAnother plus point is USB type C chargerDisplay quality is also goodI would suggest to go for this phone , worth for money	5
22686	"Its almost 2 months that I have purchased. I really like the phone @ this price. Mostly every one liked the phone. Big screen with compact size. Its even smaller that regular 5"" screen phone. I am a avg user wo gaming. But full data and GPS on. I am getting almost 1 and half days of battery, rem the battery depends on the type of network it capture. Display is very good as well i like the UI."	4
22687	Iam very happy	5
22688	Amazing. One of the best, top leadingphone with  super specifications. Primary camera gives classic, quality pictures. Super charging. Very good sound. Everything good in this price range. I feel very Happy. Great appreciation and thanks to Amazon.	5

22696	Great camera , overall best phone in this price range. The only drawback of this phone is it's Battery.	5
22697	MI A2 is the worst phone I had ever purchased. There are lots difficulties to operate this phone, and also this phone lacks some of the basic features which we can see in any middle range phone. On purchasing of MI A2 is the biggest wrong decision of life. If you are looking for purchasing this phone then I will recomend to buy any except this.	1
22698	I have option to convert apps 18:9 but I don't have for all apps it is limited apps only	4
22699	I have ordered this phone on 11th october and received it on 15th october.. today i m going to write the review after 3days of use1st of all regarding the all round performance, it is just superb and awesome.Display is superBattery life is really appreciable, it lasts 1 and half day with moderate usage and 1 day with heavy usage.Camera performance is awesome in good lighting conditionFinger print and face unlock works very fine.The only thing i m not happy is the second space does not work well.The hold and the built quality is superb. Its so handy that u ll fall in love with it.Due to its cat6 modem the network quality is awesome.Overall you can easily buy it at 10k range . You will love it.Only thing i m worried is whether it will get proper updates or not.Neways thanks amazon for the offer and MI for the beautiful phone.	5
22700	I am content with this smartphone. Good features at low price.	5
22701	Best of the best price worth it	5
22702	If u r looking for gud camera phone...plz dont go for it...Display is jst awesome....and phone is very handy...looks grt..If u r looking for unique design phone ...jst go for it..Battery can spare upto 1 day.....it takes 2 hour 15 mins to charge from 0 to 100%(if u r using the default charger)If u r playing a full hd video...it s not perfect as other phones @ this price rangeAudio....even though speaker is at back ...u dont feel it ..audio is grt and loud but sme bass s missing...overall gud speaker	4

22710	this comes withoug head phone. You need to purchase saperately. Even they are not sending the invoice for clming any gurantee in future. Do not buy	1
22711	After using one week feeling pretty good experience1 BUILD QUALITY -compared to other mobiles in this price segment this is the best choice as you got sensational metal with glass back side which makes this perfect.2 PICTURE QUALITY-clicks a little saturated Sharp images in terms of day light the camera detail is pretty clear ,if you want natural image you may select PRO mode otherwise colour will be saturated and warm ,in low light it also clicks good detail. Front camera is decent it comes out with bokeh effect and normal beauty selfie mode , in terms of video recording it unable to gives you the 4K video recording , slow motion video recording is superb.3 SOUND QUALITY- Not much louder but decent music speaker, in music player the playback option is pretty convenient  with 3D sound effect and headphone options,volume is louder in phone mic speaker , the secondary noise cancellation makes it clear.4 BATTERY LIFE - good phone for heavy users, 1 day avarage feedback with games playing Camera and video recording and phone calls but 1.5 days up to mark5 HD VIDEO CALL-this is the most important thing that honour phones Not comes up with the VIDEO CALLING feature which is the most bad experience ever with this price segment , you have to expend data for video calling.6 PERFORMANCE- The Kirin 710 chipset gives pretty good speed for game and app loading, first choice for PUBG lovers ,the GPU- MALI-G51 having a gorgeous graphics7 SCREEN PROTECTION-Not sure whether it comes up with gorilla Glass 3 or not but GSMArena specification says it has gorilla glass3 screen protectionOverall in this price segment the honour 8X will be the first choice.	5

22727	If you are searching mobile at this price range then just book this its awesome!!	5
22728	Battery backup is not good.	3

22734	Some important thing is missing	4
22735	Battery life is poor and my sub board is not working after 11 days of use and Amazon fool about return policy	2
22736	Awesome product by honor.But sound quality is not good. And no EIS or fasf charging support	5
22737	Not worthy .The Front Camera performance is of concern.Post 15 days of purchase, battery charging issue is there and due to less number of customer care centers, i'm suffering a lot.The charger- Made in ChinaThe Ear phones: not matching with the standard of the phone..	2
22738	The phone looks good and has good hardware. The biggest drawback is the front camera. It is just horrible and does not have any details. I have tested it many times and the pictures look like 1999 VGA computer camera. LG forget that people nowadays take selfie photos. A small 5mp front camera and that too out-of-focus with all smudged/blurry pictures with a lot of noise is not accepted for a 33K phone.Don't buy the phone if you want to ever take any selfie.	3
22739	Its third class cheap phone. Its first time and last time I have bought this brand. Its hardly 2 months gone and now battery charging / back up problem. Its taking more than 4 hours to complete and its drain out only in 2 hours. I suggest please don't buy it. Its nothing but only waste of money.	1
22740	Best features at this price	4
22741	Is not speed and hanging issueDisplay is super and sound also superBut it is hanging issues when data connection is on	2
22742	Awesome phone with great exchange offer by Amazon.....	5

22744	This is a good product. But battery life is not satisfactory. I think Nokia should think about it. And according to its features, it is costly. If there is possibility to give zero star then I would select that. This product is worst than imagination.I would like to give my view please don't buy this phone .	1
22745	Verry good product	4
22746	Overall a very good phone. No regrets as of yet; but the picture quality could have been better. No probs since it is a phone, not a camera. Good service by Amazon as well.	5
22747	Too much heatingLow battery lifeReceived defective piece . when playing video beeep beep distortion sound comes	1
22748	Mobile is awesome excellent built quality superb display and excellent processor camera is awesomeness and body is also full metal unibody just only one problem battery is not much nice but the phone is killer in the price segment just love xiaomi mi A2 😍😍............!!!!!!!	5

22756	Bought it 2 months before and so far it’s performance is good. No issues	4
22757	Good resolution screen. Phone is very rugged despite several falls no damage to screen. Sound quality Ok. Battery life Ok could have been better.	3
22758	Don't support dual 4G	4
22759	Camera is not that good. Artificial decorations felt in the photo means photo does not look natural. After zooming in the picture pixels appear to be blurred and picture isn't clear.Home key is placed just below the space key. We press space but back button is pressed instead and user is taken back to previous page or home screen. After changing the keypad gesture the problem doesn't go away.	3
22760	Awesome phone...battery, camera, sound best...	5
22761	Bad product heats a lot and phone hangs on normal task and if call comes during other task it commonly hangs and u can't even reboot it until it do it on its own.think before buy its better to buy other company smartphone than lg.Lg only concentrate on looks specifications and function are very bad. Lg try to improve.	1
22762	Wonderful phone from Nokia. Keep up the good work HMD!Customers beware - To opt for Servify complimentary plan, you need to open a kotak bank 811 savings account and deposit Rs.1000 in it to activate the plan. Even though depositing 1000 rs and opening a bank account is reasonable, there are two catches here - 1. You should be a new customer. If you have already a kotak bank 811 savings account, you are not eligible. 2. This account can be opened in select pin codes only. I don't have eligible list of pin codes. I am not eligible for this even though am a new customer to kotak bank because the services are not available to my pin code. So, I am not able to activate the plan. Contacted Servify, but it is of no use.I am not downgrading the rating as the rating is for mobile phone and not the mediocre marketing done by Servify.	5
22763	Idont like front cam	2
22764	Compact product...	4
22765	Don't buy this model, it's westage your money, think twice before buying. Amazon is not ready for refund amount, sound quality is poor, portrait photography is poor and performance also poor	1
22766	Average product not on the top of brand..fine not best need improvement average of about products in this price ok	4
22767	Best Phone...Speaker Is Not Good.	5
22768	Not much Worth for this price... waste of money..	2
22769	A very good phone,but overpriced.Anyways,if you are a Nokia fan wait for Nokia 6.1plus.It is going to have many features 6.1 is missing and would be a great deal if you can get it under Rs.20k.Or,Nokia 7 plus is one of the best options if you can stretch your budget to Rs.25k	4
22770	Not given back cover & Screen guard that's	4
22771	After 1week of useAfter a lot of research I buy this, instead of honor 7x.there are some reasons why I buy this1. Full vision display, fhd+, 443ppi highest2. Handy3. Branded4. 6 month screen replacement warranty5. Build quality 7000 series aluminum6. Attractive7. All the sensors8. & many more features like bothie, instant9. & it's price rs 11799/- notes, split screen and audio output is amazing.I also notice some issues.1. Battery only for moderate use2. Processor only for moderate useIf u dont mind  with these issues then it's perfect for you.	5
22772	The product is good. Delivered earlier than expected. Good quality and excellent performance.	4
22773	Its nice phone	5
22774	This is my 1st LG Phone ,I bought this phone Under 7.5k. I am using it for past 10 days & here is my final review :-1. Performance 8/10 it come with SD 435 1.4GHZ  8 Core CPU good for gaming too and lag free UI almost Stock experience2. Build Quality 8.5/10 ,just brilliant on front and its back is better than all the Redmi Products but it is a fingerprint magnet;on side it has 7000 series aluminum...feel premium.3.Battery life 7.5/10 this phone come with 3000MAH battery easliy get 5h+ ON Screen Time. I also uploaded some  screenshot see in below. No Complain about battery backup.4.Camera 7/10  rear 13MP camera not that good for this price range but it gets the work done quiet easily5. OS 8/10  it Comes with Android 7.1.1 OOB with LG  UX UI. I really like this LG UI, look like Stock Android.overol it's a very unique 18:9 full vision Display ,feel like G6  mini  under 15k :-) I think lg is also going to provide android 8 update in future. :-)  happy with the product...no other company gives you that kind of crisp display in this price range.	5
22775	I purchased this phone in 1st flash sale and after 6 days my phone is totally dead. When it was in working condition It has also lagging problem.	1
22776	Awesome phone 10 stars	5
22777	Worth the money, got a sweet deal on this device 1300 instant discount + 1000 Amazon pay cashback. As i upgraded from note 4 to redmi 6 pro i could see a improvement in the camera and processor.	5
22778	LGQ6 One of the best looking device in 15k sub price..camera is perfect but not awesome , decent batterry life, there is no fingerprint or led sensor in  q6...worst part og q6 is they have given head \ ear phone jack at bottom of the phone which i feels quite uncomfortable while watching videos we have to keep phone upside down while listening music when your q6 is in your  pocket if you are looking for a good looking. 15k range phone than definately go for this..selfie lovers & high end gamers this phone is not for you..	4

22798	After a week use!First of all the display is really nice. There is a heating issue near the volume button when I use my phone with charging.You wouldn't find a better phone in this price bracket with a premium display. Don't have a finger print sensor (don't really care though)If you are a Person who don't play games play much and uses more of social media apps and watches movies this phone is for you.	5
22799	Picture quality is good with good battery life however the sound is low as compared to Mi Note 5 Pro. Having said that the speakers r good enough and is not an issue.Delivery by Amazon Prime guy was pathetic. Had to follow up multiple times and requests to have it delivered. Very very pathetic experience for a prime subscriber.	5

22814	Smart phone is good but redmi6a is much faster.	4
22815	Phone looks good with metal sides and rounded display but that's it. It has slow chipset, plastic back(which can be scratched super easily), no notification light, no fingerprnt scanner. If you are a light user who dont care about these stuff then this is the phone for you, it is gorgeous to look at and feels like a super expensive phone. It has super thin bezels and longer screen which makes it's one hand operation easy. But it is not made for heavy gaming, it will handle light tasks easily.	3
22816	Nice and above the rating mobile	5
22817	front camera is not satisfactory .The phone gets stalled while operating.Was a big fan of MI till date but after purchasing MI 6 pro lost faith in MI.	3
22818	Phone becomes very hot even after using basic apps such as youtube, chrome. I thought recent software updates will cope up with this but phone is absolute hot box. I wish i could return this product. The phone becomes so hot you can not even touch it.My first and last LG	1

22831	On the very first day of unboxing i had to go for a replacement option since fingerprint sensor was not working properly. First it worked and i registered my fingerprint, after that the sensor started heating to such levels that i had the burning sensation on my fingers for next 40 mins. Battery drained from 67% to 23% in next 1 hour, even when the phone was in idle mode	1
22832	First of all Thanks for amazon, for delever the product before expected time. The honor 8x is the best performing and good looking device. The looks is awsome and sound quality, camera,  picture, and AI system is the best. Battery life is very very good. Overall the phone is best in this price range. No one competitors for honor 8x in this price range.	5

22861	Nice product but when using of multiple app at a time, mobile is getting heat.	4
22862	Camara quality is aswsome  n bettery super duper	4
22863	Battery is a worst part, very bad performance. Many common features are not available. Only camera is good rest waste for money	1
22864	Absolutely disastrous product guys, I'm a genuine phone reviewer, but this phone's battery and the hanging issue is unbearable. Think a thousand times before buying this	2
22865	Front camera clarity is very bad... rest all good...	4

22867	Everything is quite impressive.	5
22868	Worst product from LG. No Mimimum features. Not able to ZOOm camera, Cast Screen not available and many other basic features are missing.. Please dont buy it.	1
22869	I think in this mid-range price xiaomi done excellent Job.. battery life is very good and picture quality is also improved ..	5
22870	Good colour.	4
22871	I got the phone delivered today on time, here is the review after unboxing.( I just don't want to mention specs as they are already known)Pros:1) phone finishing is excellent and picturesque.2) face and fingerprint unlocking responding very quickly3) medium sized phone gets good grip in hand and fits in pocket4) flexible back cover provided in box.Cons:1) Earphone not given in box2) No slow motion recording or time lapse which is disappointing3) Display is small and do not occupy maximum area of front body4) UI is completely similar to old MI phones Overall the phone is worth buying keeping the specs in concideration. Hope Redmi provide more updates soon in software and do justification to the high-tech hardware.	4
22872	heating too much.	1
22873	Battery life is Worst. Worst  mobile ever	1
22874	It is a near perfect budget Phone.For those who are looking for a finger print scanner too and not finding it on this one, don't get sad or judge this because the face unlock works just fine, rather I was not expecting such good response from the face unlock option considering the price point, offcourse it won't work just as perfect in low lights but you just can't get everything in this budget. Display is decent. Loudspeaker is above average.Go for it if you want the Full View display and the face unlock( It's just freaking awesome to see your phone unlock with your face)	4
22875	Battery life - ClassicRear Camera - DecentFront Camera - Good (So so)Redmi Note 5 Pro or Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 better choice!!	5
22876	Picture, sounds & Battery too good	5
22877	Amazon delivery was good and so does the product.	5
22878	very nice phone. superb!READ MORE	5
22879	Mobile performance is great but camera is not natural colour	5
22880	earlier in their description about the phone it had dual standby feature and that's why I've purchased it ...they dooped me and now demanding a screenshot of the same from me rather they must be having that anyone here also been exploited in the same way?	1
22881	Good display quality and batter performance is awesome Good pH in this budget all over good thank u Amazon and mi	4
22882	3rd class mobile	1
22883	Good phone but battery sucks.. Sometimes heating problems are  also there.	4
22884	LG Q6 Selfie camera is very bad for click picture and rear camera is also bad	2
22885	A good handset with a great battery life.	5
22886	Look of the mobile is good. Display is better. But camera is not good. Front camera is very poor. In the dim light front camera is very very bad. Pic become blurry. Back camera is medium. Mobile is heating very much on the back side as well as on the sides. Battery is not also great. It can hold only 5-6 hrs on medium usage. Face unlock takes a lot time. Sometimes it doesn't unlock. I don't know why ?But personally i advise u all that not buy this product at this price. Many better phones are available in the market.	2
22887	No video calling option in volte	4
22888	Camera qality very bad so plz  mat lo ye mobile	1
22889	Excellent compact phone. Great build quality. However, lack of any screen protection does result in tiny scratches when we receive the product (I confirmed with 4 other people and they all face the same issue.Display is great, camera is the best I've seen. Great in low light too. Speed is great, they've tweaked the processor for multitasking.In summary, I'll recommend this phone but the lack of a screen protector is a minus.	5
22890	I have bought this exchanging old MI note 3 for 10500.Display is superb. 5 stars.Sound quality is nice. 4.5 stars.Battery Life is awesome. 5 stars.Camera in daylight is okay. 3 stars.Camera in lowlight is bad. 2 stars.Overall camera. 2.5 stars.I gave rating based on my presumption about this phone. I have been using OnePlus 5T and Camera is superb on 5T.Con:When I used Honor 8x Camera, it did not convince me its configuration. It is not good. Color saturation is on higher end. Every picture would look punchy in color and unnatural.Videos are unstable. Low light pictures are pathetic.If you're considering camera phone with under 15k budget, then you have other little better options.Pros:Except Camera, this phone is a 5 star phone. No issues at all.LCD Display is fantastic. Crisp and clear. 18.5:9 full screen display is awesome. If you don't like notch, you can hide it in settings.Battery backup is awesome. Survives more than a day when used it hard. And more than a day with normal use.I don't think not having type C is any issue.UI gives you multiple options. I loved it.Overall a good package. If they could have given best Camera in this package, it could have been a Diwali for consumers. But, I think they could have priced it higher then. 😊😃	4
22891	Sound quality is OK but if u oi wanna use your earphones you have to use the adapter, which you cna use only once for second time you have to restart your phone and on the software part once it's updated to pie 9, your phone will start hanging and lag gin and your apps will close within seconds of opening it, so overall don't buy this phone note 4 is 50% better in performance then this.	2
22892	Due to plastic body ...Samsung is not changing the OLD style	5
22893	The best thing is its camera. I really love it when i am out for photography. Also dome hidden features are really great. This phone has approximately similar camera to one plus 6. So in this price range Xiaomi had done a great job on this model. I ma happy with this device. Nothing is perfect in this world.	5
22894	0.25 points are more enough.Don't buy this product.heating like Forme and Gfive. Battery discharge very fast.	1
22895	good mobile and	5

22921	Display :- 10/10Battery :- 08/10Performance :- 08/10Design :- 10/10Back Camera :- 09/10Front Camera :- 07/10Speaker Output :- 08/10Overall :- 08/10	4
22922	For a net price of 6.3k, it's a good deal for me. However, 11k is definitely an overprice for this product. I'll share a brief review of this phone.PROs:-1. Display is bright and vivid. Sound is pretty loud. Excellent.2. Phone is lightweight. Definitely feels small for a 5.84 inch screen, thanks to 19:9 aspect ratio. Metal back is good too. Design Excellent.Tip: Go for red, looks very attractive and premium.3. Primary camera is great in the price bracket. Front camera not so. Decent.4. Battery life is long. Lag free experience. Very Good.Now, for the cons:-1. Software and apps not completely optimised for the notch. Will find bugs here. Ok.2. No dual volte support i.e., no 4G on both sims together. Gorilla Glass lacking. Poor.3. Not for selfie lovers. Front camera is nowhere near Note 5 Pro.Conclusion: It doesn't stand out, as such, in any particular aspect but does give a good combination of low and mid range fetaures. For average users- go for 3GB variant as it offers value for money. 4GB variant is absurdly priced given the camera quality and chipset (SD 625). Thumbs up will help.	4
22923	The phone is good but not great and in the current market the price point for this phone and its features doesn't match at all, the price made sense when it first got released because it was one of the first phones to have 18:9 screen and face unlock but in the current market it doesn't make sense. First things first this phone doesn't have a fingerprint reader which might not have been a problem if its face detection was a fast and accurate which it isn't so you are forced to use pin or password. The phone claims to be full hd but screen resolution seems lacking compared to other phones in market at the same or low price points and the cartoony os is not helping at all . Performance wise the phone is ok but if you game or use any heavy apps its start to lag . Battery life is ok . The build quality is good as it is from lg and the sound is ok not loud but also not very low. I would not recommend this phone unlesss you are getting a crazy good deal on its price .	3
22924	best phone in this range ! go for it !!!!	5

22965	Look is very adorableM happy with itCamera is worse	4
22966	I feel lucky to have it in cart on launch day and it was delivered on 16th August as committed by Amazon. This is BEST budgeted stock android phone with excellent CAMERA under 20K. I am sharing my experience after using it for 2 weeks.1. CAMERA: Best camera under 20K. Low-light photography is drastically improved. Front camera is also too good. Video recording is way better than other competitor.2. ANDROID: It is well known since launch that it will come with stock android. Means, the updates will available FIRST and for LONG time. It comes with ZERO bloatware. You won’t able customize interface like other UI. One need to keep this thing in mind but I believe now we don’t have much time for customization so better go for pure android experience. With next pie update mostly missing gestures will be available.3. BATTERY: Don’t go with NUMBERS in this case. 3010 mAh battery will last for full day with moderate usage. Battery will be charged full almost within 2 hours. Plus you can use Quick charge 4.0 once it’s available.Apart from above all others features are above par. Few things are missing like 3.5 mm jack (but you will get a connector for 3.5mm jack in box), no external memory support. However, all things were clarified before launch so no one can argue about that.ONE word it’s competition KILLER at AFFORDABLE price. BEST CAMERA PHONE under 20K EVER.Give me a thumbs up and ask questions in the comment section.	5
22967	I think zenfone is a better option.	3
22968	Best mobile in this range after REDMI NOTE 5 PRO.	5
22969	Phone is good in looking but one very big issue. HEATING.....	3
22970	Battery backup worst otherwise phone is good.	4
22971	Poor camara	1
22972	This is the best phone in this price segment, battery is very good, with moderate use can stay for more than a day. Picture quality is comparable to any premium phone. Sound quality is not as compare to lenovo dolby, this is not a issue as we hardly use to listen music using phone sound. If you are not a professional photographer then you will like the camera also, which is good for our daily use. Don't worry about negative reviews and go for this	5
22973	Value for money. Compact phone with Premium design and Amazing Face unlock feature.	5
22974	Camera not satisfaction	4

23006	I have been using this phone for past 9 days and overall the phone is good.You already know the spec and pros so I'll go to the cons directly.**Cons**>>The notch isn't perfect as there are software glitches for different apps in the notch area but it's nothing a new update cannot fix.>>The camera isn't fast enough in HDR mode but again this isn't something a new update cannot fix.>>The phone could've come with a screen guard preinstalled as is the case nowadays in all phones.>>Xiaomi should refrain from putting all the unwanted apps in the phone but luckily some can be unistalled and some can't be.>>The price is a bit on the high side or atleast they could have given a much more current processor.So overall go for this phone if you're not a gamer and is Looking for a decent phone with current specs(almost).*Winks ;)	4

23021	Another Midrange killer Smartphone by XiaomiMajor Highlights:• The Redmi 6 Pro sports a 5.84-inch full-HD+ display with a notch• Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 SoC• The phone is priced at Rs. 10,999 for the 3GB RAM variant (Start Point)• Battery of 4000 mAh and its Durability• The Tripple Slots• Dual AI CameraWell in Redmi 6 Series you will get 3 Different Smartphones with different specs, and from all of them, Redmi 6 pro is most powerful and advanced (as said by Redmi India in their launch event).Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro design:Being the most premium phone of the new Redmi 6 family, the Redmi 6 Pro has been given somewhat better materials, in the form of a metal backplate. However, the overall design isn’t too different from what we’ve already seen from Xiaomi at around this price point. This is a fairly thick phone, and it's a bit hefty too, but it’s manageable. The buttons have good feedback without being noisy, and on the left side, you get a single tray which can hold two SIM cards and a separate microSD card. Something worth noting is that the Redmi 6 Pro does not support dual 4G VoLTE, which means that only one SIM can connect to a 4G network at a time, The placement of ports is good. The mono speaker is on the bottom right, so chances of blocking it when using the phone in landscape mode are slim. The headphone socket is placed on the top, and you also get an infrared (IR) emitter which can be used to control IR appliances through the Mi Remote app.Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro specifications and software:The phone uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 625 SoC, which is a couple of years old now but is still a capable chip for general tasks. Gaming performance isn’t great, as some popular games like PUBG, and asphalt default to the lowest graphics settings, and even then, gameplay isn’t smooth. Our unit was running on a pre-release version of its MIUI software, which prevented us from running most benchmarks.Storage Options:Well I am impressed with the Xiaomi as they provided triple Slot in sim tray (2 for nano sim & one for SD card)Heating Issues:Well, I do not find any heating issues in this phone while playing games like PubG and Asphalt.Camera in Redmi 6 pro:The rear 12-megapixel camera has a f/2.2 aperture with PDAF. Autofocus was decently quick in good light. There’s auto-HDR, which did a good job of balancing the exposure in our experience. We observed good detail in landscape shots in daylight, and colours were pleasing too. The main sensor stumbled a bit with macros, as it simply wasn't able to resolve finer detail. The white balance was a bit of a hit or a miss in close-ups, and we often found ourselves having to tap-to-focus to get the white balance back on track. Saving HDR images takes a good couple of seconds in daylight. I would be very happy if they have provided the Flash in Portrait Mode, still, you can Tap on Torch icon to switch, on the torch, you will get the flash in Portrait Mode.Battery in Redmi 6 Pro:Battery life is one of the strong suits of the Redmi 6 Pro. The 4000mAh battery easily lasted us a full day and a bit more on one charge. Playing heavy games didn't drain the battery too much either. In a single round of PUBG (around 30 minutes), in which we survived till the very end, we recorded a drop of around seven percent, which is not bad. In our internal video loop test, we got a runtime of 16 hours and 45 minutes, which is very good. The Redmi 6 Pro doesn’t support fast charging, but the bundled 10W adapter gave us roughly a 55 percent charge in an hour, and it took us roughly 2 hours and 35 minutes to charge it completely from zeroWell before buying this phone I have heard many issues regarding inbuilt Advertisement in Xiaomi devices, and I checked that too in my previous Xiaomi phone which I am using since 2 Years. And actually, I found inbuilt ads in those phones. You will see ads in inbuilt developers apps like MI Apps, Mi Music, Mi Videos, Security, File Manager, Themes, sometimes you will see full-screen ads which are really irritating for Mi Fans, but there is a cooler way to stop those ads those who wanted to know contact me.Final Verdict:Well for the people who want a notch Display, Big Battery and Descent Camera you they can buy this phone blindly.Suggestion for Xiaomi India:  You should stop those inbuilt Ads present in your devices because we customers don’t find those ads Valuable. Because we are not Surfing any website where many ads are present. So please stop it.Note: Pics Included in this Review are captured by Redmi Note 3	4

Fingerprint and face unlock features are very fine. The video quality is very fine to watch not to shoot. The speed is incredible and the display is very fine. However the sound quality is above average and the loudness seems be above average too. Hopefully, the software update can fix camera. Overall this is very good phone and has premium look. :) Kudos!	4
23097	Speaker not too gud and low voice	4
23098	Battery is heating up like crazy just after 1 month of use	1

23108	I liked the back camera quality and picture quality and disliked front camera	4
23109	I am no happy	1
23110	Phone is really good, But it missed the options like Advance security options like secure startup and it is not good.Pros:Big screen,Battery,Dual Camera,Split screen,Dual stand by 4G-VOLTE,Super face unlock,finger print placement is really good,sleek and superb design.Cons:Lack of EIS,Front flash,Fast charging,You cant view videos in full view(It occupies only 5.5 inches while playing video we have to duple tap for zoom)You can go for it.	4
23111	Nice phone sound quality is superb	5
23112	Overall best phone with best price range. Ear phone pin is smaller hence need to buy which is suitable for MI A2	4
23113	This is beautiful phone with low performance.Hanging problem started after first update.Mobile is restarting automatically .	3
23114	Everything is as expected but theres an occasional lag every once in a while. Moreover the UI still needs some work. Minor bugs here and there overall this phone is a Showstopper which will put every other phone to shame in terms of looks.	5

23116	Display is superb, camera and battery backup looks avg to me.	5

23119	As this mobile doesn't support fast charging, all the other features at this price range are awesome. I am using this mobile from the past 2 months and till date i couldn't get a perfect Screen protector. All the others are OK. Received the package before expected date of delivery.	4
23120	Worth the cost	5
23121	Best choice of all-Battery backup is not bad as some reviewed-Single time screen replacement warranty is worth of few thousand itself-camara also good in this price range-the new aspect ratio made it stunning look... Again in this price range-unfortunately screen was broken with in week after purchase and got replaced free of cost. THANK LGLater I purchased case.	5

Exchange was also smooth.Bought in great Indian sale.Haven't obtained the 10 percent Amazon pay balance as advertised in the sale.Will update after more use.	4

23192	LG Q6 comes with latest Android nougat with 5.5 inch full HD display. Screen aspect ratio is 18:9 which you will also get in Micromax infinity (best under 10k). LG Q6 has nice touch input anf smooth display With no heating issue.Pros:1. Nice screen and display.2. 13mp rear camera and 5mp front camera (Micromax infinity has 16mp front camera).3. Comes with 3GB RAM and Snapdragon 435 processor4. Good 3000mah battery.5. Dedicated SD card slot.6. Good build and bodyCons:1. No fingerprint scanner.2. Battery drains out quickly.3. Poor front camera4. No so good for high end gaming.Overall its good phone that LG brought in Indian market under 15k budget. But better options are still available if you want.	4

23206	so nyc	5
23207	I never liked a NOKIA before - never intended to. i was a sony fan (proper rectangular phones) from the beginning. The look of this phone impressed me to go for it. It turned out to be good decision. Performance is good too. Battery not too much though (not bad either). Android one tag will make sure you get software updates pretty soon (It's upgraded to Pie from Nov 1st ). Camera - good enough. Speaker - ok. Overall - good buy	4
23208	Nice & Good  LG Q6 mobile	2
23209	Good phone in range of 13000	4
23210	Product is good, but service is pathetic. Received this product by 9pm after so much of coordination with delivery person who was very arrogant also. This rating is just for service. And 5 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 for product, so go for it and it was the best deal.	1
23211	3d class qulty	1
23212	Nice battery but camera is ok. Screen is very brittle... I don't think gorilla glass. Broke very easily.	4
23213	This mobile very nice and nice battery	5
23214	This phone has serious signal problem...battery back up is ok...camera is decent. Best part of the phone is Display. Not Fully Satisfied with the phone...for practical usage this phone doesnt suite..	3
23215	Lagging issue is appearing while opening some apps like gallery or playing a video.camera is nice, battery is nice.. inspite of 4 gb ram phone it's lagging it's quite disappointing	3
23216	Everyone in my family owns mi smartphone. I wanted something different this time.Let's talk about cons;1. Front camera is below average. Rear camera is decent but not natural colours.2. No EIS/OIS. Camera and video stability is missing.3. Soud is not loud in earphone.4. Speaker sound khul kar nahin aa rahi hai. Sound output is irritating.5. MIUI theme is better than EMUIOtherwise, this is a good phone at this price.Please hit like if this was helpful.	4
23217	Only 10 days old and my phone is dead. Called to Amazon and they are telling to contact LG service center. Now I have to look for LG service center with new phone. Pathetic.	1
23218	Adaptive brightness feature is not working perfectly. There is a problem with light sensor.When you hover a finger on the left side of the camera, the screen brightness reduced to 20% or so and never increase to the actual preset level. Attempted multiple times to slide to 70% brightness but once put a finger and shade the left side of camera, it goes down to 20%.For sure, it's a sensor related problem and not just limited to one or two handsets. Hence it seems to be a major issue !	1
23219	Nyc if ur looking a beautiful phone in a budget not a performance oriented phone	4
23220	Good picture quality and battery life	4

23233	system is not install	1
23234	Good product within this range.. reliable	5
23235	Very downgraded camera.. Honor 8x failed with the so called 20MP dual camera .  Saturation levels cannot be  compared even with a 2mp camera phone. Often the pictures taken  are very very  unrealistic . Sees like the AI function is pathetic. EIS is a definite miss. Slow motion camera is also a failure. Can’t recognize the  moving objects clearly . Video play back is also not that good. YouTube videos in fully screen  lacks clarity.  A number of time the  Camera setting were  changed to default.  But of no use.,  Hope the company may  rollout few updates to rectify these basic issues.	2
23236	Battery is poor	4
23237	The best phone in its categoryThe display ahh it's extremely crisp ...just love itIf u can afford it go for it	5

23251	Nice phone quality @reasonable price	4
23252	This mobile is very awesome. Its battery life is also very good.Picture quality and sound quality is more than its worth.	5
23253	Bought this on 7th October and now if I want to sell using exchange then it is just 1000 rs worth. Hangs a lot, screen not responsive at times. Face ID is too slow and if I remove my specs then it doesn’t recognise my face, Face ID is a farse. Spent 14k for something that is giving me 1k rs if sold, within 4 months. Please don’t buy this piece of shit even if it costs half the price as you can get better products in that price.Doesn’t have fingerprint sensor and so I have to use touchscreen to lock the screen. My moto g4 plus with burnt out screen pixels was better that this.	1
23254	Not up to expectations	1
23255	This phone is really good...i bought this for 9.5k after exchange offer...I am gettibg good battery backup..Performace is also good and no lag..I dont play games..I am not facing any heating issue...Call quality is also good...I am very much satisfied with this mobile..	4

23275	good design ,good batter life ,worth for this price range	5
23276	Had read amazing reviews online about its camera, which led me to buy it. So far am really happy with the camera. Seems to be better than phones of my friends even while taking images while partying.Other than that, display is good, sound is ok, battery lasts till evening, phone is on stock Android so is fast.Looks could have been bit better though.Hope I get updates till Android Q!	5

23314	Have been an user of Huawei phones, Honor 8x is the best one in sub 20k price bracket. Premium glass back with metal sandwich design..Resisted hard to put a back over.6GB RAM is icing on cake, 4GB is also enough for regular uses. Sound quality on 3.5 mm jack is subOptimal.Rest of it is awesome, had watched many reviews & unboxing But among poco F1, realme & android one...8x is the overall performer. No cons encountered on couple of days.	5

Android optimisation- needs a work4. Sensor- sometimes during phone call screen light doesn't turn off automatically & many apps will be opened during call.	4

23342	Really nice camera and processor. Battery life is also not bad but it's not a big issue as it supports quick charging. Xiaomi phones don't have software lagging issues which is commonly found in Sam mobiles. Xiaomi is providing phones with competitant specifications. Gaming experience on this phone is really great. This phone don't have fm, 3.5mm jack and expandable storage but I don't have issues with this as these are minor issues.	5

23379	overall the phone looks cool but camera quality is lil bit above average	4
23380	Don't purchase Huawei brand Mobile's from Amazon, you won't get quality product, definitely you will get diffectiv product.	1
23381	Good smartphone in budget range for all ppl.Grt camera with good viewing angles... Bit heavier than other mobiles. Grt screen colors and best battery.	5
23382	Back camera is fine.. But front camera is average..Only go for it if Camera is not that mandatory..Performance wise BEAST😎	4
23383	Like:-●Camera Quality is Awesome.●Sound is Superb.●Selfie Camera is also Good with Flash.●Picture quality is Awesome●Battery life is Ok●Low light camera is SuperbDislike:●Bugs in Phone like sometime your mobile won't ring even its on general mode. You have to restart it.●While talking on phone, screen light doesn't go off. I think its sensor problem. Due to this you speaker goes On or disconnect the call due to touch●No seperate head phone slot.	4
23384	Look is awesome camera also good... but battery life is not up to the mark...	4
23385	Dual sim with dedicated memory card slot.....or else only hybrid was also best	5
23386	A glitch free experienceValue for money	5
23387	The successor of MiA1 succeeded in making a first impression. Rear camera (12+20MP) give you amazing quality pictures in this price range, maybe up to 20k range smartphones. Bokhe effets are excellent. 20MP front camera made the main difference from Mi A1 which had 5 MP camera. This AI powered front camera make your selfies life into it.4GB RAM and 660 Snapdragon processor made this phone a superpower in this segment. None in this price range can compete with this, except Poco F1 which has a slight high price. Android One lover will be surely amazed by using this one in Oreo 8.1. I expect pie will make this phone a budget killer.Picture quality is excellent, user friendly interface by Google Android one makes it a cutie pie.But, this product have some drawbacks.1. Design is good, but speakers (2) at bottom is just for show. Only one is working. So that unutilized space should have been given to audio jack.2. The internal storage is abit less, ie. 64gb, actually 128 GB would be more acceptable.More review will be added after further use.	4
23388	Good product, battery is very awesome	5
23389	I am grateful to Amazon and Jeff .Thank you for delivering goods and making life better .Thank you.	4
23390	Don't worry about the bad reviews by some people. It's a premium device with great features. Don't compare it with the likes of Xiaomi,honor or any other budget brands! This is a class apart. Its a great device to use with regular monthly updates which you won't get in other devices except Pixels. Go for it if you want a quality for money device👍	5
23391	Picture quality is awesome, battery life is little bit less	5
23392	Worst mobile i have used in recent times.1) Battery life is pathetic!! The moment you remove the charger after it shows 100% charged, it starts showing as 99%... 98% within a minute!!2) Heats up like a furnace!! Have recommended this phone to the Indian army so that they can procure them in bulk using our defence budget so that our soldiers keeping a vigil in Siachen can use these phones as a quick heating device!!3)Camera quality is pathetic!! can be used for fliming UFOs, making bigfoot and lochness monster videos or anything that needs the poorest camera quality!!4)Phone processor speed is slower than even redmi note 3 which was my phone 2 years back,even my samsung galaxy note 2 performed better than this phone..5)Face recognition feature simply does not work!!Beats every other competition in the market for being the worst mobile phone of the year!	1
23393	Bought on the very first day of it's launch. I must say that m feeling heaven with the use of honor 8x... Master in style nd it's elegance ❤️❤️...!!!Honor u simply nailed it! 👏👍💯Tnq honor for such a osm launch and tnq even to amazon 😊❤️❤️	5
23394	This is very cheap quality mobile, mi says it has corning glass but it is fake because empty plastic bottle fall on mobile then mobile glass break. My suggestion is , this is 3rd class mobile if u r spending 17-20k so as compared to price it is not better mobile ,in this mobile from starting of use it had serious issue ,mobile get heated,1rst time I replaced this mobile and got new one but in mobile sound problem	1
23395	Overall super mobile	4
23396	Battery backup is very poor and backward key is not proper functional	2
23397	Good mobile at perfect range...Look sexy easy to handle	4
23398	I have loved moto for its durability, stability. When the new G6 was launch i got it the very next month due to its specs and looks.Pros (on my usage of 6 months):1. turbo charging is a blessing2. Sound is good (for a budget phone user)3. HD recording4. gestures to navigateCons (6 months usage)1. Battery size2. Battery drains easily (i play no games or watch movies on it, purely whatsapp and calls. it can drain battery overnight with no use)3. Horrible Gorilla Glass - my phone cracked from the front and the back in just one drop.4. Its a slippery phone and loves fingerprints.5. Noticeable lags in the performance while multitasking6. Replacement screen costs almost same around 12K7. Yet to receive an android updateI used to preach Moto for budget phone users, but not anymore. While moto is trying to squeeze a lot of specs and looks to justify the cost,  its durability is compromised. A Budget phone user will want to stick to a good phone for at least a year and unfortunately Moto G6 wont last (at least in a single piece). In this price range I would recommend a Nokia alternative....If you still want to buy G6, choose a screen protection plan/ mobile insurance... (just in case)	2
23399	This mobile is just a lit.the camera is a flagship camera the performance is just awesome and the most of the people are talking about its battery that it is not good but in actual condition it is good I am playing pubg for around 3 to 4 hours and it consumes around 50% battery.	5
23400	I use my phone mostly to watch videos, read articles, surf online and minor edit pictures. My only condition for a phone is - it must not start lagging anytime soon and must feel and look good. I am not a selfie freak and enjoy taking pictures on what is in front of me.And to me this phone is amazing. It feels great, looks amazing, works very smoothly, display is stunning. Enough for mw to not whine about whats not in it.	5
23401	Speaker issue	3
23402	Excellent phone for this price. Yes, the same processor is in Honor 7x, but this comes with USB-C, Wide color gamut and a way cooler design. No lags encountered yet. Good camera.	5
23403	Phone speaker is not working at all	1
23404	A decent phone with performance and features worth more than what you pay for. Camera is amazing and battery is not that good	4
23405	I have purchased this phone before 2 weeks and happy as of now.The phone looks stunning.Very compact in your hand.  Easy to use with one hand.Smooth touch screen.Good back and front camera.Bright sharp full vision display.Face recognition is working good in good light condition.Take some time in low light.No finger printBack panel is plastic and getting scratches easily.  We have to use back cover which kills phones look.Front camera could have been better.Attached sample shots.	4
23406	Best camera in this budget. Battery life is also good. But cannot use earphones and charge the phone at the same time one issue. Rest all is great.	4
23407	Excellent !	5
23408	Redmi 6 pro, a powerful chipset in a budget rangeWith a first notch display in MI, dual AI cam, big battery and a very good display.Pros: 1.big screen and clear pixels2.good battery backup as it's 4000mah3.notch on top4.new gestures5.sd625 performance6.decent primary camera7.fingerprint works good where face id is also perfectCons: 1.same old boring launcher2.front cam could be more perfect in lowlight3.price could be a bit less4.need more updates in the UI5.No notification icons in notched display	5
23409	Work for battery backup n Z4 touch guard and cover	1
23410	If you want good battery then please don't buy this phone i am using this from 4 months everything is fine but battery sucks.Looks are awesome.	3

23422	I can just say, wow. For a phone like this in 15k is worth a deal.Display is awesome😍.Camera is satisfactory.Battery life is  too good.Speakers are good too but need to be improved.Gaming experience is awesome without any lag or heating issue.And last but not the least, the Design, no smartphone can match its design, even the ones in the higher range.All in all it's the best smartphone in this segment.	5
23423	Go for MI or RealMe phones if you want a great product at very good prices.The Redmi 6 Pro is no exception, with amazing specs it delivers true to the promise.Camera and sound are exceptionally good for a sub 15k phone	5
23424	It Has excellent battery and good picture quality. But hasn't low weight and size is too big to use .	4

23486	Phone crack you y help me	2
23487	Excellent product. Processor and Ram works beyond expectation.Pros : 1. Display is marvelous. 2. One hand use. 3. Wide angle selfie with beauty mode. 4. Inbuilt Performance Optimization app works well, no need to install Ram manager. 5. Notification pannel pulldown shortcut in onscreen buttons.Cons : 1. Not all apps run in 18:9 and onscreen buttons take up a chunk of display. They should have been transperent. Need to root my phone for immersive mode. 2. No fast charging. Battery average. Need to carry powerbank if you are a heavy user. 3. Screen casting not present. 4. Plastic back pannel easily gets scratches. I recommend purchase good case as soon as possible because I had so many scratches on back within 2-3 days without case. Also add padding in case cover because it tends to lift the tempered glass protector.	5

23531	Bad experiences to by this phone bad quality hang problem no battery life	1
23532	It's really a good purchase. Product was supplies in two days by Amazon. After 3 months of usage, the mobile is working fine without any flaws. Maintain battery for 1.5 to 2 days of moderate usage without heavy gaming. I am fully satisfied. One of the drawback to mention is camera captures good images but paints with slight artificial over colour. Anyhow the performance is very good. Nice smartphone at below 15000 budget.	5
23533	Camera app is slow	5
23534	I bought this phone on 18th july and i was quite excited about it because i was buying a phone after 3 years. At first i thought that its a very good phone for such a price (i bought it for 20k). But now they dropped the price to 19k and i guess it will drop further. The reason behind it is that the company itself is making phones under their honor brand with exact same specs with price 6k less than this one. The phone is no doubt great but i think pricing is too high for such specs. So, if you are willing to buy it, please don't. You can buy the honor 9n which has exact same specs, that i would recommend. Only difference is the camera which i dont think will bother most of you. Also, this phone doesn't support dual volte standby, which is quite disappointing to me because many phones priced lower are offering the dual volte support. I would not have bought this phone if i knew this earlier. Well its my fault that i didn't do enough research before buying it. But launching a phone with exact same specs and pricing it 6k lower... Is this justified, i want to ask the company, because it is never expected from such a company which leads the phone market in china and also sits at one of the top positions in India too. Really disappointed.Phone is not worth the price, other phones with exact same specs or even better are priced quite low, for eg, you can wait for realme2 pro	3

23539	Highly dissatisfied with LG. I got a defective handset from amazon. The phone has heating issuez and there was problem in the screen display of the phone. On 14th aug the phone was delivered and on 21st aug I went to LG service center to check for the issue. After investigation the LG service center representative told me that the phone needs to be replaced. It is almost 1 month now and still there is no update when will I get my handset back. It is a very bad service from LG. Please be careful while choosing this phone.	1

23543	Awsome mobile... I've been using it for over 15 days and i can say that this phone is superb according to looks,camera and battery backup the only thing i dont like about this mobile is the speaker .... Its having a bit distortion when volume is high .... Otherwise i love this phone	4
23544	Just can't describe its beauty in words, i would pay 16k just for its looks and in hand feel..Everyone knows the specs and everything is excellent..My only concern was those negative or criticizing camera reviews.. So.. Camera is definitely one of the best, nokia just needs to improve software processing, until then use 'Google Camera(cstark27)' and see the mind blowing results yourself, [switch On ADAPTIVE SHUTTER SPEED in Advanced settings and switch to HDR+ Enhanced]...after september ...READ MORE	5

23553	perfect delivery ... working fine	5
23554	LGQ6 One of the best looking device in 13k sub price..camera is perfect but not awesome , decent battery life, there is no fingerprint or led sensor in q6...worst part of q6 is they have given head \ ear phone jack at bottom of the phone which i feels quite uncomfortable while watching videos we have to keep phone upside down while listening music when your q6 is in your pocket if you are looking for a good looking. 13k range phone than definitely go for this..selfie lovers & high end gamer this phone is not for you..	4
23555	I got the phone for my Grandad, I was misled with the reviews my bad, I should've first gone to a nearby store to experience it by hand. He was complaining the sound quality of the speakers and the camera.Cons:The fone feels like it weighs moreSlippery in the handScreen color calibration feels datedPro:The almost bezel-less displayHas expandable storageDual-SimStandby time and Screen on time	3
23556	It seems ok	3
23557	Flaws - low voice on callingRest all good...	4
23558	First Honor 4x then 6x and now using 8x... All the phones have one similarity .. they never had heating issue what's so ever...I just love Honor build quality.. picture quality and user interface...and five star for Amazon	5
23559	Front camera is not so goodBattery backup is very niceAnd back camera perform good in day and night	4
23560	Everything is okey but internal components are cheaper as well as all Chinese brands	4
23561	It's a great handset with Android one.	5
23562	I love stock android, and this has the android one experience and pixel-like updates. Camera is really insane. My needs are 2 two-minute calls and 2 five-minute video calls a day, along with an hour of MLBB gaming every day. I indulge in 3 hours of PUBG and MLBB during weekends. Interesting that 3 hours of gaming only uses 35 to 45 % of the battery.	5
23563	Best one in categoury, good battery life, full screen with notch, good quality photos, face unlock works in darkness by using screen light, looks stylis.	5
23564	Good phoneToo much fast delivery by amezonUltimate phone with this price tag. Just only 9000 rs with my old phone exchange.Its ultimate display. Full satisfactory phone.Thanks Lg for change my thought about u.	5
23565	Pros1 - Great Design with Premium Build Quality2 - Great Display3 - Great Color Variant (It doesn't really matter which phone you pick, they both look and feel premium)5 - Decent Picture Quality But Not Promising EnoughCons1 - Same processor as that in Honor 9 Lite2 - Fast charger is not included in the box which is disappointment because Fast charging was my first priority and I believe no manufactures except Asus (Zenfone Max P1) offers it under INR 20,000/- at this point of time. This is one of the main selling point of this device but sadly Indian package doesn't include one. I hope even though the charger is not included, it supports fast charging with Huawei Quick Charge.3 - Back cover is not included4 - Instead of including cheap earphone, if Huawai had included Quick Charger then it would have been much more appreciated.5 - Heats up little bit on normal usage but I think that's normal.6 - Battery drains pretty fast.Don't know about NFC.So remember, Majorly you are paying for that notch display (which also not properly implemented), withType C port,64 GB Internal,4 GB ram,premium build qualityand decent picture quality.	3
23566	Bad performance. Battery backup is too bad	1
23567	worst Amazon app please dont buy anything From amazon app Ban or stop dis product soon it's waste of money buying dis phone any of apps not working properly n costumer care response s very horrible	1
23568	All is good but battery life low. Although a good product	4
23569	All features are super cool, the battery, the sound quality and the picture quality are working awesome....	5
23570	Ooo my god superb phone I am so happy	5
23571	Worst mobile ever. Camera quality is very poor.Want to return but no option available to return in Amazon for this item, very disappointed	1
23572	All good except battery life	3
23573	I am moving from a medium segment phone to a good budget phone, previous phone Galaxy on7.Samsung is a disastrous when you buy mid range phones, they work good for 6 months and they have N number of issues.This Redmi 6 pro, looks great and feels great in hands and the unboxing experience is great. Redmi has stopped giving earphones along with the box from long. Hence expectations were ZERO.The charger and the data cable is of good quality and there is a small sim card removal pin(They've decreased the size of tool)Positives:Compact form factorDisplay quality (70% matches Iphone X)Great battery life (Played 1 Hour of PUBG) Dropped from 100%-70%Usable space of 52.69gbNegatives:Design is the same as most other Xiaomi phones(please guys we're bored now)Low-light camera performance and worst front cameraNo unique selling point, there is newer version of SD processor in 6 seriesBottom line:The Redmi 6 Pro by Xiaomi is an attempt to bring mid-range features to the budget segment and keep up with the times. While a tad boring, the Redmi 6 Pro is still a great device for anyone looking for a reliable, functional smartphone. There’s nothing new here. The Snapdragon 625 processor is much maligned by power users, but it does the job well for most budget smartphone buyers.I would rate it 3 stars just because of the camera, running a third world company there is no room for error!I hope this helps!	3
23574	I like to good performance of processor speed	5
23575	"Product is as expected and perfectly fine.Issue is  I Clicked ""with Exchange"", but order placed ""without exchange"""	4
23576	Very good as described this is android one, it's fantastic 👍	5
23577	Haip	5
23578	UPDATE (17 Aug):Battery:Following are the charging times from 10% to 100% using different chargers (WiFi was ON, mobile data OFF during charging. If mobile data is ON during charging then the times will only increase especially on 4G):- Using charger supplied in the box (1.2A, 5V) - 2h 15m (Max battery temp reached - 32.6 degrees)- Using a standard charger  (2.0A, 5V)  - 1h 45m (Max battery temp reached - 33.4 degrees)- Using a fast charger (2.0A, 5V or 1.67A, 9V) - 1h 42m (Max battery temp reached - 33.9 degrees)So to conclude, This phone does not support fast charging, however you can save half an hour using a 2A charger which is considered as a std these days and is supplied with most phones in this segment. But it is always recommended to use the charger & USB cable supplied in the box and also using a low rated charger increases the battery life in the longer run.The battery juice over a single charge has been above expectations and am pleasantly surprised. Easily getting 1.5 days usage over a single charge under normal use on WiFi (No gaming). Overnight battery drain results have been impressive with only 1-2 % drop.* For those facing battery drain on idle, switch OFF 'auti sync' for a cpl of days and monitor.Camera:Overall am quite happy with the performance of the rear camera for the price i've paid for the phone. Images are fairly sharp, shutter speed is excellent. takes a bit of time to focus though, low light performance is also decent. Attaching a few snaps using rear camera under different lighting conditions.Selfie lovers will be disappointed with the performance of the front camera. Yes it has a wide angle feature but even if it had a 180 degree angle still what's the point if the image quality is not upto the mark.Audio Output:Placement of the speaker has been the biggest disappointment in this phone. You can easily miss a call if it is kept face up on bed or sofa and you are not in the room. Audio quality through 3.5mm jack is excellent.** To emphasize it's sleek form factor am attaching a pic of side by side comparison of Moto G3 (5' screen) to LG Q6 (5.5' screen). Both are same in height and in width LG Q6 is a lot slimmer.IF YOU SEEK ANY MORE MINUYR INFO REGARDING LGQ6 THEN USE THE COMMENT SECTION BELOW. I'LL GET BACK TO YOU. THANKS---------------------------------------------------------------------------------I bought the LG Q6 (Platinum color) at an effective price of 9290/- [ Exchange offer Rs 1200 off + additional Rs 3000 off on exchange + Rs 1500 (SBI card cashback offer during independence day sale)]Honestly i was waiting for the Nokia 6 and expected the Q6 to be priced between 18-20k but ordered Q6 instead when i saw this listed here with some offers and calculating the effective price.In the box:- Handset with built in battery.- Headphones (Not the in-ear type, just the simple ones which won't be probably used ever).- Power brick.- USB to micro USB cable.- Information leaflets.Advantages of this phone over others in same price segment:- Biggest plus is the full vision full HD+ (2160 x 1080 pixels) display with a pixel density of 442 ppi. This kind of display is first in the price segment.- Made of 7000 grade aluminium making it tough and durable but note that it is only the frame & not the back.- Snapdragon 435 which is the current generation chip as compared to 430 being used in nokia 6 which is a generation old.- Dedicated dual sim slot and separate micro SD card slot.- Single hand use possible despite 5.5' screen thanks to the thin bezels- Latest android version 7.1.1 Nougat- Launch offer of one time free screen replacement within 6 months.Where it lacks:- No fingerprint scanner.- Speaker located at the back.- Many phones in this price segment come with Snapdragon 600 series SOC , so in gaming & heave duty performance it will lag in comparision to Chinese brands.Impressions after receiving the phone:-DISPLAY:The main selling point of the phone. It comes with a full vision full HD+ (2160 x 1080 pixels) display with a pixel density of 442 ppi and is just gorgeous to look at. Easily the best display in the sub 20k category. In fact if just the display is considered then this gives the flagship experience.RATING - 5/5BUILD QUALITY:Pros:-- Made of 7000 series aluminium which is resistant to scratches and toughens up the phone, has a military grade build certification but only the side frame.- Comes with dual nano sim slot along with a dedicated micro SD slot expandable upto a whooping 2tb.- Weighs at just 149 gms which is excellent for a 5.5' phone.- Screen has corning gorilla glass 3 protection (Source - GSM arena) plus the company is offering one time free screen replacement within 6 months of purchase.- Comes with all the imp sensors (Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass). Generally in this price segment reputed companies like Samsung have been known to emit some imp sensor to cut costs.Cons:-- Major area where it lacks in my opinion is the placement of speaker at the back which will muffle up the sound when it is kept on soft surfaces like bed or sofa, also the speaker opening can be easily covered by hands when watching videos or playing games. Hence the potential of a great multimedia experience thanks to the gorgeous screen will be spoiled a bit.-  No fingerprint scanner which is a std these days (Comes with a 3D face recognition though, the effectiveness of which remains to be seen).- Only the side frame is high grade alumimium but back is made of plastic which is a fingerprint magnet somehow.-  Also no IP rating, normally we see that feature on much more expensive phones but budget phones have come with this feature in the past like Moto G3RATING - 3.5/5PERFORMANCE:It has an octa core Snapdragon 435 SoC with 3GB RAM and 32 GB inbuilt storage  which is running on the latest Android version 7.1.1 to maximise it's potential and is still better than a generation old Snapdragon 430 SoC used in soon to be released Nokia 6. But in this price segment there are devices available which have Snapdragon 600 Series SoC which is better. So in terms of performance the Q6 lags and if you are a gamer who likes to play high graphic games then you will be disappointed with the lag. Otherwise for a light to moderate user not much into gaming, this Soc will take you through your daily tasks without any hiccups.RATING - 3/5BATTERY:Comes with a non removable 3000 mAh battery which on paper is average and should last an entire day under normal use. Depends how LG has maximised the potential of the SD 435 SoC which is not as battery friendly as SD 625.This phone does not support quick charge (To be verifies) and the power brick supplied has a rating of 5V, 1.2A which is very ordinary and below average even for the phones in this price segment & a micro USB cable (Not type C). Will update this section after using the phone for a few days on the battery juice and the charging time.RATING 3.5/5CAMERA:Comes with a 13mp rear shooter with f/2.2 aperture. Might not stand up to the phones having dual cameras in this price segment on paper but the initial impressions are that it fares well. Images are crisp with a good dynamic range, fast focus. Suffers a bit though when images are zoomed in but can't really complain for this price range. Low light images are decent thanks to the OIS present which is excellent to have in the price range. Capable of recording full HD videos.Front shooter is 5mp again with a  f/2.2 aperture and seems to be a bit average. Highlight here is wide angle selfie shooter (100 degrees compared to the standard 82 degrees).RATING - 4/5Will attach a  a few pictures of the unboxing in a few hours. Will update the review after using it for a few days with the usage Pros & Cons along with camera samples under different lighting conditions.VERDICT - If you aren't a hardcore gamer or heavy user then you'll enjoy this phone. Yes there are some major flaws (No fingerprint scanner, placement of speakers), but if you can overlook them for that gorgeos display at this price point from a reputed brand like LG then don't think twice. Keep in mind that in the same price there are many Chinese brands offering better specs BUT AFTER SALES MATTERS !!	4

23595	Overall an average phone.The 4G didnt work at the beginning . Had to get it fixed from a professional	3
23596	Camera quality is much better.	5
23597	Don't expect too much. During night the camera suffers well. Just assume it is Redmi note 5 pro with a notch. Nothing else. Also found the same experience as note 5 pro in gaming (PUBG-2 matches & ASPHALT9 - 2 matches). The only thing I noticed that it is not warming up fastly. Even the length of the Charging chord is reduced. Who does this? Like.. seriously?But still if you are going to follow the trend you can get it.	4
23598	I have bought this phone 5days ago camera quality is not good in low light, battery performance is too poor, I don't think I have gotten a genuine product. One more thing according to descreption of the camera performance is not satisfactory. I m not getting any kind of texts on phone about the camera and phone what is available in other phone or a1.	3
23599	Experience with Amazon delivery and support is good, Amazon is Quick and supportive. however their norms do not have flexibility.Coming to product, its from LG Brand with full vision display which is selling point these days.Unboxing nothing surprise it comes good packaging and simplePhoneTravel AdapterUSB cableSim EjectorFirst look of the phone feel wow however back is very average looks and plastic back prone scratches easily, definitely take back cover.Initial days i was disappointed with heat emission from phone near volumes buttons, later updates seemed to fix the issue.Camera is satisfactory, Selfie come very good in day light conditions and same with Back camera, indoor light camera struggles to focus and capture with proper light.Sound is good and with Headphones it provides good sound output.coming to main attraction THE DISPLAY - it wont disappoint you, definitely great display, easily you can watch movies on 18:9 displaybuild quality is great and it feels solid in hand.Cons:FPS missing - Should have provided at this price pointFace ID - works in good light condition with your original face (wearing spectacles wont recognize:)  )IR blaster missingcasting option - wireless display missingnot for heavy gamerOverall its worth buying i got 3K extra for exchange, which is one more point made me to buy this phone.I am not greatly happy not sad of buying this phone.	4
23600	Battery life.. GoodPicture quality.. Good	5
23601	Pros:1. Small and nice mobile.2. Display is awesome3. Best mobile for low budgetCons:1. No led light2. Getting heat very soon3. Battery backup problem.	4
23602	Jumped and coming to the feedback-1. No dedicated headphone jack- though i don't miss it but at times while traveling when my phone is running out of juice and i am charging it on the go, i wish the headphone jack was there so that i could listen to a Specific playlist and relax.2. aggressive RAM management - some apps are killed a bit too fast for my liking when not in use. but they open pretty fast again so its not much of an issue.3. no fast charger - now this is one thing i wish Xiaomi had done better. this phone supports Quick-charge 4.0+, while we are getting a normal 10W charger. the average charging time is 1 hours 20 minutes. I would recommend everyone to wait for 2-3 months to buy a certified 4.0+ Charger is released, instead of buying a Quick-charge 3.0 charger right now.	5
23603	Like this device but bettry life is very bad	4

Used this camera on ladakh trip & the pics were very similar to a friend's OP6.2. Bright display. Decent performance in sunlight as well.3. Great looks. Rear glass panel looks awesome.4. Super fast charging with turbo charger.5. Great selfie camera with flash for low light picsCons-1. Snapdragon 450 os not good for multi tasking. Should have been SD600 series processor.

23740	I am using this phone from last 1 monthsIt is very good mid range phone from honorI like this phone but camera quality is average, may be they fix it from software updates	5
23741	Best Android one powered mobile phone under 15k right now, dual camera setup is good, portrait effect is good. Battery is average	4
23742	Total waste of money.they will exchange the 4gb variant with 6gb variant for extra 14000 rupees that's a total of 26000 if you bought a 4gb variant and you want to go for the 6gb variant.	2
23743	Very bad software , most of mi app not working	3
23744	Guys despite its powerful processor and ram on paper this phone lags. I won't say it hangs, but is slow(lags) sometimes. Which was really not expected from such reputed brand.Pros:-It gives me a very premium feel. I mean just because of its looks I use it without back case.-Easy one hand use-Light weight-Fingerprint sensor(lock screen) is quite fast.-Charging speed is quite good. It takes around 100 minutes to get charged from 0-100Cons:-All the cameras are dissapointing. I mean the pics taken are very artificial. A small pinch of zoom will reveal its fakeness. The images are bit blurred both in front and rear case.-Speakers are not at all loud-Battery backup is not that good-Rear flash is very dim-Fingerprint sensors in applock are damn slow. It takes around 2 seconds to open. Which irritates atleast me.Overall: Don't buy this phone. U can opt for honor 8x at almost same price or go for redmi phones.	4
23745	Good product with super battery life classic looks and good sound quality	4
23746	all best	5

23749	Looks rich. Buying phone in May 2018, comes with an advantage of having a screen with a notch. The phone has a good camera & Bokeh mode specially.  The custom Android version EMUi  is helpful. Just could improve in sound loudness.	5

Compare to Real me 2 pro and MI note 5 pro, cost is little bit more but this is great device.back camera quality is excellent, front camera is also excellent but in indoor condition pictures are noisee, this is only software problem, I use beauty plus me to resolve these problem and using beauty plus me front camera is flawless superb pic quality I seen.Processor is great gives superb performance and optimisation is great specially for battery life.Also battery life is very very good of Honor 8X I have seen. I used it for 1.8 days after charging it tp 100%.2 days battery life when using it more than average.Great mobile friends.	5
23770	Phone is good but front cam is poor	3
23771	It's 2018 and Xiaomi is still giving Snapdragon 625 processer . Instead of this you should buy Asus Zenfone max pro M1 for flipkart.	4
23772	Overall very good.... Camera is over saturated so it is taking pictures of more beautiful than the real... But it's good in night... U can see more in the camera than the rest u see by ur eyes.... Sound of the loud speaker is bit low... Also no headsets r supplied... Best part is the battery... It will last long for 2 days of my normal usage & more than a day for heavy usage. I am satisfied	5
23773	Mi A2 camera best quality and sound quality.. battery life poor. Android one wow I'm so happy for this product	4
23774	Nice item	4
23775	Battery life is bit less but if you are looking for performance then it is not a issue to carry another power bank however phone is not much faster as expected pubg lags in high grafics, Android one is much good, design is good,compare to this I think I should have gone with honor play,Nokia 7.1 plus or pocof1 which is actually a beast	4

23830	"Good phone at this price range of 9988 INR during great indian festival. Also get a 1100 cashback on my amazon pay balance thats why actual cost is 8888 INR.Iam using redmi note3 since 2.5 year thats an amazing phone. Compared to that display changes from full hd to full hd+.Its handy with 5.84"" disply. Battery is same as 4000mAH. Back camera is good with depth effect bust sometimes focusing not get proper and video stabilizaton is just ok.Snapdragon 625 is a typical soc in note4 and some other xhiomi devices thats ok at this price. But front camera is not good in my personal openion same 5 MP camera used mi in my old note3. I think low light performance of from cam is not good compared to old note3 front cam lot of grains occurs in artificial light condition. For those who have selfi maniac dont go for it.I love the disply, battery, back cam, phone's design( its quite handy).Dont love the front cam, position of notification light, and lack of notifiction in the top of the on sreen and network operator.Overall its ok at this price range i alreay told you. My personal openion is go for it only when you get min 1000 offer price.Just⭐⭐⭐🌠"	4
23831	This phone is just amazing. You can consider it under 20,000 segment smartphones. You will not regret buying it. Just one thing which it lacks is electronic image stabilisation during video mode in camera	5
23832	This is powerhouse from Huawei. Best phone in this range and a tough competitor for phone till 30k. Camera is very good. Smooth operations. And it looks really good.	5
23833	I have purchased mi a2 and  nt all satisfied with product.when ever i want to make calls from Jio sim showing mobile network is not available and every time i have to restart my mobile for making calls then it works fine for 15 mnts again I can't able to make calls...kindly help in this issue...its totally annoying tired all sorts of things aim change check inother fone ..	1
23834	I have had used Mi note 5 pro for 5 months, now recently i bought mi 6 pro, after using both the phones i can say that Mi 6 looks, handling are better than Mi note 5 pro. mi 6 pro's  Display Quality Is way better than mi note 5. performance wise both were almost similar. Few advantage with mi note 5 pro is Ram,  screen size and few others  Which are really ignore-able when compare to the offered price. Mi note 5 pro Is almost 50% expensive than mi 6 pro ie. 4k - 5k .  When Compared to Mi note 5 pro with mi 6 pro, i would  vote for Mi 6 pro - reasons :- 1. quality 2. performance. 3 Pocket friendly.	5
23835	ausm	5

23843	Over the last few years, I had used some of the Smartphones like OnePlus One, Nexus 6, iPhone 7 but these phones are nowhere comparable to the Honor 8X. When I thought of buying a phone, I had waited for OnePlus 6T, somehow because of the price tag I choose not to buy that. Then my alternate option was Xiaomi or Honor or Oppo.After several reviews and analysis I thought, let me go with Honor 8X. Now I feel My choice is good.I have been using this phone from last 3 weeks and until now my experience is quite good with this device1. Ultimate Performance ( downloaded and using 100+ apps),2. Good battery life (2 days on a normal usage)3. Camera Quality is fantastic than my earlier smart phones and is on par with the latest phones.4. Handy even though the size is 6.2 Inches.5. Face unlock performance is good.6. Interesting Android features, Camera Features, Picture Editing features7. Full Screen Display8. Display Quality is quite good	5
23844	Using from past 3 days & the conclusion isIf photography is your first preference then don't think go for it because under 17000/- segment there is no competitor for its camera performance . I gt it in 13500/- during sale. Camera performance was actually superb even in low lighting condition,edge detection also good. Wrost battery life , no headphone jack & no expandable memory card slot disappoint me .	4
23845	Average product at this price range	3
23846	There's  no warranty card neither  protection  glass (tempered)Even when it cleary mentioned  on the box.	4
23847	There is nothing to say about technical specifications. It does what it says. Obviously, it's Nokia. Strength point of view, it's excellent. Battery pont of view, when used heavily with internet and GPS on, it comes down to around 30% from 100 in 16 hours. I would have been super happy with a slightly more powerful battery.	5
23848	It's very good mobile	5
23849	Mi is good for another company bt good phone	5
23850	all good in this phone but must need for camera improvement.Camera click photos in very low size.front camera is better then rear.READ MORE	4
23851	Phone camera app got frozen on very first day even without any new app installation. Further while installing new apps again play Store app got frozen in such a way that I couldn't make it to go back.	1
23852	Best full vision display Amazing phone..it's one of the best phone in LG mobile	5
23853	Must buy for low budget	5
23854	Not FM Radio, gallery, sound quality not good, not duel speakers	2
23855	Portrait mode is awesome	5
23856	Totally good.. Nice mobile	5
23857	so far so good, good looks!	5
23858	Phone is 5.15 inches camera is pretty good phone display is awesome gaming is good but phone getting heat but less compares to moto g5plus and lg ui is super with exllent features.	5
23859	One of the best product among mi versatile and wide range of verifies.Look n Fill is nice.Performance wise better.Running smoothly.Barry backup is also good.1 drawback is: Pricewise costly.Notch screen looking goodOverall good.	5
23860	primium look mobile.... Using this handset from last one week working very nice...Just go for it instead of moving for other mobiles...	5

23862	Have been using from 2 days intensively. Here are my pros and cons:Pros & cons:Display: Suberb display. Great color accuracy. Sunlight legibility is good. Black levels are excellent. Almost bezel less looks simply amazing. I think it has gorilla glass 3 protection on the front. Screen guard comes pre applied.Build Quality: Amazing build quality. Front & back glass with a aluminium frame, phone looks premium.Sound: External sound is slightly on the dimmer side. Sound from the headphones are pretty good.Camera: Don't know why people are complaining about the camera. I found it to be excellent for the price. AI works pretty well. Both rear and front cams take good pictures. Although this is a mobile phone camera so don't expect Dslr quality.Software: UI is buttery smooth. Many useful features. Loads of themes and customization options. Happy with the UI. Only concern is Honor's software updates. Its still on September 2018 security patch. Ram management is Ok.Battery: Battery endurance is good. Can do a full day marathon. 4G connectivity eats battery fast. Rest for all other functions the battery does a good job.Packing: This is where I am not happy with the seller. The phone box was simply wrapped inside a air bubble cover. They could have provided another carton box to keep the mobile box. My mobile box has taken some good beatings. Lucky that the phone was safe.I am happy with the purchase. The phone does the job well and it is a good buy at 15,000/-. I exchanged my Redmi Note 5 pro for this and I believe I made the right decision. Although no type C connector, but not a big deal for me.	5

23864	It has the WORST CAMERA EVER! The images have a lot of noise, are over saturated and exposed. Selfies are blurred and look fake. I received my phone today and I am already regretting. The software could be good and all, but a camera so pathetic that it makes you look old, A BIG NO!!! Just do not buy it!	1
23865	Totally wast of money no customer support. No volte calling no inbuilt call recorder sound quality in head phone and speaker very poor	1
23866	Only drawback is its back cover is very smooth. So extra caution required as it is easy to slip from hand	5

23877	The quality of display is very bad. The fonts and application icons are blurring. I request flilkart for return the product. They rejected the return request and tell me that there is no problem with the product. Though there is blurring on display and display quality is not good, I have been forced to use that mobile. Flipkart is not allowing me to return the bad product. That means you people are saling low quality product through online and force us to use it. There is no value of money. I...READ MORE	1

23884	No problem with the working of the phone, it works great. People are complaining about LeD, fingure print scanner which are necessary in products wih this price tag HOWEVER HOW CAN LG MISS MIRRORCAST FEATURE. Its a must have feature, even phones for 8k has this feature, i would have not bought this phone if i was aware of this LG BLUNDER. Another thing which sucks is the sound quality of the phone, absloutely flat only treable no BASS. Also if i download EXTERNAL EQUALiSER and MIRRORCAST app, it is not supported. It looks like LG have concentrated on the screen of the phone only. Highly disspointed, atleast LG should send a cloud patch to fix this issues	1
23885	Excellent look and great performance.	5

23893	Very nice phoneLog battery	5
23894	Amazing to handle , light weight , sleek design , high end camera clarity , superb display.Cons are 1) Little slow on processor2) Battery is not very long lasting.3) Headphone Socket placed on the bottom left corner is a bad design ,since we hold the phone more comfortably in this way. While doing so the headphone jack gets disturbed and music is interrupted/paused.	4

23898	No words ... Just awesome but front camera isnt that great ... But overall neutral performance , screen 2:1 ratio no words to say about that ... Looks as if like a flagship nor something not every phone has , unique screen ... Nd i suggest this for who ever is looking for style ( design ) nd brand ...	4
23899	Update: June 2018. Took the phone to the LG Service Center at Chandivali, Mumbai. They replaced the screen immediately and across the counter. Frankly, I did not expect the service experience to be this good.--------------------------------Update June 2018: Phone screen has started flickering and going off abruptly.------------Using this phone for about six months now. Quite happy with it.My usage is typically business, no gaming.Very responsive, great screen resolution, decent battery life.Only negative i can think about is the back cover scratches very easily. Should have bought a cover.	5
23900	Just fall in love with the screen... Its awesome.Very smooth UI. Good build. Feel premium in hand.Camera disappoint in terms of pixels. Even In day light pictures comes hazzy. 15k phone shud have better camera.	4

However now at this moment when i am writing this review my friend is not so lucky at all.. Same issue battery is dead and phone is getting exchange value of 1500 with in 6 months time.. This proves the product was a failure since the beginning and LG knew it all the way. While selling they offered exceptional buyback value of my old phone and was wondering why.. But now all the dots are connecting well.. Well played LG.	1

24029	Hi frnds, people are diverting with their false reviews on this product. Don't go for this product , as it is  a good only lookwise and all other aspects worst. Iave used it for 2 days and I am writing this review. Except looking this phone is absolutely not good and worthy. First, heating issue is there and also battery is getting drained like anything. And, it is taking more than 2 hours for  100% charging. And, this is how finally a made in India product looks and works.If still want to buy check with your friends and relatives, if anyone is using and try to use this phone and then decide to go for this or not.	1

24088	Very nice phone. A very good screen and light weight. Easy to use in one hand. After two days no lags whatsoever. No heating issues its there but very little even less than redmi note3. It takes time to get aquented with the camera but it is good could have been much better. Battery backup for me it lastedfor whole 1 day with 10% remaining. Sound quality is good in earphone and also on speaker. Sound level is also good on speaker. Call quality is excellent. For the price i got it is a very very good phone. No fingerprint but i rarely used it in my redmi note 3 as it was too bulky. So if any body gets it at the price of 10-11 thousand after exchange shoukd go for it. Looks different feels different.

After that i could not switch on the phone.Immediately i reported the complaint to Amazon.They requested me to contact NOKIA.finally i reported the problem to NOKIA.Till now they could not find a solution to solve the problem.Feeling completely disappointed.Trust me i was a very big fan of NOKIA.	1

24176	Camera takes time to stabilise and capture. So forget quick shots. Device has slowed down within 1 month. And had to factory reset because it stopped accepting face and finger print.	4
24177	I think i got a defective product.While using it on the first day it got hanged and restarted 4-5 times.Latest security updates didn't fix that.Battery is below average.Camera is good but not awesome.Headphone jack will be an issue later.	3

24191	Mi A2 has a good battery life even it's 3010 mAh then also. The camera quality is good. And the sound quality is better and loud. But it doesn't have a 3.5mm jack and no radio option available.	4
24192	camera picture color not good.	4
24193	Firstly, I'd like to talk about the (notch) display. It is really amazing and feels premium. Sound from the speaker is very loud but a little more bass would've been better. Camera is good and a software update for improvement was provided recently. Gaming is smooth but some games have to adapt to the notch display. Software and game developers have to solve this out. Battery backup is really good. A very heavy heavyyy user will get a full day backup. supports two sim cards and a memory card which is cool. Call receiver is good too. Over all a great value for money and very capable phone. Go for it.👌🏻	4
24194	hanging so much	4
24195	Amazing product. LG has done really excellent Job. Phone looks very premium. I was waiting for Nokia but LG steal the show by surprise launch. Guys trust me this phone is worth to buy. Thanks to Amazon for such a nice exchange value as its cost me 9.4 K in exchange of my Asus Zenfone 6.	5
24196	Good screen real estate and sound quality. Camera and battery life needs improvement... Picture quality is not as great in the dark. Battery drains very quickly compared to MI Redmi Note 3. Face recognition doesn't work always and we are really missing the touch id	4

24201	"Pros:- Looks great and lovely FHD+ display- Feels good in the hand because of its narrower and taller design- Really small notch (which can be hidden if you are not interested in seeing a notch)- Very thin ""chin"" to give an almost bezel-less experience- Very good battery life- Good crisp photosCons:- No EIS.. Videos will be shaky unless you are super stillNo fast-charging.. Comes with only 5V~2A charger"	5

24281	LG smartphone. Why not try new. Yes the look is dazzling n i luved the UI. Very impressive looks. Handy n compact even though 5.5 inch. Battery heating will depend on usage. Do not use apps while charging or it will heat. Drains little quickly than u think.smart doctor app is useful one shows n optimizes phone. Multiwindow use. Nice themes for LG. Apart frm battery drainage n little heating this is worth ur penny. I got it for 9.5k including cashback n exchange of my old one. Pls do not frgt to use jio benefits if u buy this.	5

24294	Good product, value for money. Video and Picture experience with FHD is very good. Battery life is also very good. Overall performance is satisfactory...	5

24296	Lg new innovation full vision display are awesome...latest android version naugat nd battery also good .	5
24297	Awesome product everything is well.But I have an issue with replacement  at amazon .	4
24298	The phone is awesome.The latest update in this phone is ride mode which is the best for the bike riders. Don't think too much just go for it coz in this range feature updates n everything abt mobile is mind blowing.	5
24299	Got as per expectation	5
24300	Mobile is good but the battery is very poor, be careful, if you are willing long lasting battery then it is not for you. Heating problem is also there. Don't go for it. Major manufacturing defect is that the screen is not uniformly made at the corners, tempered glass do not fit properly on the screen at corners.	3
24301	Camera quality is excellent.battery life is too good,overall nice product	5
24302	Very fast next day delivery. Item is safe and working very good.	5

24310	Camera, OS, Battery, RAM, AI are just perform more than good.Speaker is satisfying.Body is beautiful.Overall : Beast With Beauty at this price league! Fantastic 8x!!!!	5
24311	Phone gets hang every time	1
24312	Dislikes: sound quality, audio output is very low. Face unlock takes much time to recognise face unlike realme 2 pro that was very fast. Camera was not upto the mark and OK with that price tag.Likes: charging quickly no problem with that. Display is crispy can be viewed even on 90 degrees. Fingerprint sensor works good. No heating issues. Charge is OK for a full day use as a normal user. For heavy user 9hrs may be. You can go for it.	3
24313	Worst EMUI. Whenever I will get cal between using any other apps. If I pick the call. Will loss app screen and calling pop will come	3
24314	1. It should come with a bigger battery backup as the screen consumes lot of power..2. No Protection for camera.. The camera might get damaged when you place it on the table aftr a certain time3.A expandable memory slot would have been preferred	4
24315	Front camera not up to the mark	4
24316	Sond and camera quality is so good... ....but battery life is short......but product is good	5
24317	It's good and reliable.	5
24318	satisfied. but camera could be better. very attractive looking.	5
24319	Who says camera is bad in this deviceI guess it's camera is much better than c9 pro.Very smooth and basic and user-friendly interface.After few months also it runs very smoothly.Only disadvantage of this phone no fingure print scanner	5
24320	Good picture and sound quality with day lasting battery life	5
24321	Super REDMI 6 Pro	5
24322	Bought this phone on 20may 2018 for 9000Rs through a lightening deal....For that price, this phone felt an amazing choice. Now after a days usage, let me list the pros and cons.Pros:1)Standard feel of LG and the feel of using full vision display.( previously i used Redmi note 4 and was fed up with its Miui and buggy updates.So this feels a real relief).2) compact form factor: My previous phone had 5.5 inch as this one but this one feels a lot lighter and compatible for my small hand without compromising on the display size.3)Full HDplus resolution: More pixels than 1080p display.4)Durability : Feels its a lot durable than chinese manufacturers.My previous phone had dead pixels and screen ghosting (out of box)with a damaged power button when i abandoned it.(Customer care was horrible😜)This one feels more solid and is 810 US mil.certified. And I still own  an LG L70(2014) in perfect working condition .So Hope this one lasts too...5)No cliche hybrid slot: Separate slots for microsd and dual sim.6)Aesthetics : I bought platinum colour and the back isnt ugly at all.Though u must use a case as its prone to scratches.Now coming to cons, i felt1) Average battery backup: My previous Redmi note 4 had a humongous 4100mah battery and lasted for a full day with really heavy internet usage.This one lasts about 3/4 of that backup.So a little unsatisfied with that.2) Lack of fingerprint : Added face recognition as a compensation, but that one isn't useful....doesnt do the job. It opens the lock really 🐌 slow.( After a recent update, it has improved but is almost usless in daytoday life)3) Lack of notification LED.4) Was good if it was 5.7 inch display.As some space is used up for onscreen buttons.5)Very average front camera: Redmi note 4's was little better than this ones.6)Bad charger: very slow charger.And that what i feel after using it for 1 day after using Redmi note 4 for an year.	4

24422	Note 5 Pro is much better	4
24423	I will tell you the one good thing about this phone: its back ground display is completely black i.e. matching standard of iPhone. Its too good in performance and display. You cant compare its build quality with cheap chinese phones. Also one more good thing is preinstalled apps are not much so you get nearly bloatware free phone.	5

24455	This product is not comfortable.	1
24456	Good product & nice deal in Amazon	5
24457	Headphone jack gone and if i plan to use a Bluetooth headset ahhh...only 3000 mah battery drains fast and pubg lovers 1 hr game =50% battery	3
24458	Very nice look or battery life is good	4
24459	Actually 3.5 stars. I got a 3gb ram 32gb storage. I got it for around 6.5k with exchange (Mi3s) and added bonus on sale. My top priority of phone is making calls and a slight browsing and watching videos. I frequently had call drops within few minutes and also the call quality is same as Mi3s, No difference. Browsing speed is a slight greater than my old phone. The quality of the display is good and i can watch videos on youtube without headphones, speakers are loud. If you get in a well light area you need to keep the phone in full brightness and sometimes that too will not be sufficient.The notch is a bit out of class. I hate it. You won't get notified but just a LED and that to a fair white LED, no colour change for calls, messages, charging near complete... But you can hide the notch, but still you miss the notifications, you need to scroll down the notification windows everytime your phone pings.Battery is good. I can easily get a day battery  with always on Internet, medium brightness, 1-2 hrs youtube without headphones and minor minamilistic usage. No heating issues i see. Charges within 2 and half an hour.There is a bit lag in the OS on 6 pro. Hope would get fixed in miui 10. And the default keyboard is NOT good, switch to google keyboard.You get about 10-11 gb left to use with new device.If the phone is on offer l, get it. If you are skeptical to get it, chose the nokia	3
24460	very nice phone in this price..i love redmi..nd thnx to Amazon for timely delivery	5
24461	Phone is good, smooth experience, camera quality is also gud not best but there is heating issue in ph.	3
24462	Phone felt good for the first 10 days but after 10 days of usage the phone has started restarting again and again on its own.	2
24463	Xiaomi phones are most value for money products. Serves more features at low price. This 6 pro is great with low budget. It has a notch for notch lovers. Camera quality is good enough.	5
24464	Fantastic display . great picture quality .camara is too good . Good battery backup every thing is fine	5
24465	Phone Is Good But There Is So Much Heating Problem and camera quality is Awesome	4
24466	Good product in every sense	5
24467	Nice Phone. 4G net speed is little bit less than as expected.	5
24468	Nice phone Brilliant quality...	5
24469	The phone itself is good, camera is great, performance is good etc.But in my phone, internet and network in 1st SIM doesnt work after receiving calls on Sim 2. Sim 1 starts working again after restarting.I got the 1st phone exchanged from amazon, but the sealed replacement device I got also has the same problem.	2
24470	Its a good mob and worth for money, expected good headphones with the phone	4
24471	Good phone under 15k.	5
24472	Better than the best	5
24473	Battery life seems to be good... Camera quality is good. But pricing seems to be little more so I give 3 star.	3
24474	Product are excellent.	5
24475	We can't expect things made this good at this price point. It's unique and no words for it, just a happy customer!!☺	5
24476	Picture and sound quality is good but function and feature function is not good and also setting is not better compare to other mi phone. And sound jack is not available. Charging and sound jack is useing only one jack.I am not suggesting to buy this phone	3

24480	Good budget phone.smooth performance.good display.awesome two day battery life. Easy to handle by one hand . Fingure print and face unlock is very good.MIUI customisation  like application lock, security scan features are also very good.  sound quality through earphones /headphones /bluetooth headphones  is below the average, sound disortion is more.Its feeling hammering sound to ears.Front selfie camera is not upto the mark.	4
24481	Mediocre	2

24487	Good Picture QualityCellular Reception Quality Also Very GoodBattery Life Awesome	5
24488	The phone is good. Camera too good. Battery is getting drain quickly. No fingerprint sensor.  Has. Nfc. Made in India.	4
24489	One disappointment was there was no earphone not even basic one I don't know weather's it's from dealers side or companyRest everything is good	4
24490	At the same price range, you have better options available. The battery is very short and the quality camera is really not up to date.The back of the phone has a brighter look than the photos. Definitely not suitable if you travel a lot and do not want to constantly worry about charging. A fully charged battery lasts 4-5 hours depending on usage. The battery runs very fast from 8% to 15%, even with minimal use.Pros: Runs smoothly after a year, looks, cell phone,Disadvantages: Short battery life, speakers, camera	3
24491	Good phone for camera and normally uses	5
24492	Is phone very long time battery and camera almost is best value for money.	3

24503	It is good phone on this price, feature is good and camera quelity excellent.	5
24504	After 3Month Used this mobile I wrote this review.Over all ok .Camera .Rear is Good .Front is not meet expectations , because 24 MP .Processer is regular in Huawei product Kirin Family .Not bad .looks good .Very slim and candyPrice little high ,15K is ok .Touch - screen corner touch little slow response while using.	4
24505	Sound quality is very poor.. Speaker is very bad like a some wrost speaker enabled.. Headphones sound is really very very bad.. Not enjoying.. Even you can't plug to listen song on earphone.. Really very bad.. Don't buy its wrost.. Not value for money	1
24506	Really satisfied with mobile...colour contrast Display, Camera quality and gaming is superb, battery is good enough for whole day... and more important mobile looks stunning...also not heavy or big.. 6.5 inch is handy... So don't hesitate to purchase its one of the best in 15k range..But only thing i... Hate is why there are no ear phones...	5
24507	Best option to buy at this price with dual camera.	4
24508	best phone best camera best performance best battery complete value for moneryREAD MORE	5
24509	Totally worth it	5

24511	Everything including the fon's look is great...	5
24512	It's aswom	5
24513	Except battery back up everything is very good,but in this price range one can expect better battery life.Camera quality,picture quality quiet good.	5
24514	Value for many. If you are looking for a phone under 15000 then this is a must buy phone yar very very very good i am just in love with it	5
24515	Battery saver is good option n useful	5
24516	I am giving scores out of 10Design - 10Display - 9.5Build quality - 10Camera - 9Sound quality and loudness of speakers - 7Battery life - 10Performance - 9Sound quality and loudness through good headsets - 9.5The User Interface of Huawei/Honor which is EMUI 8.2 is smooth, fluid, lag free, user friendly and is loaded with a lot of useful features. Applications load fast too.If you like punchy, vibrant colours in your photos, you will love the camera.If you like natural colours in your photos, you may not like the camera.The night mode is awesome and useful.Honor 8X is the first phone ever with a certified eye comfort mode. I use blue light filter all the time and it does not strain your eyes.The phone is lighter than the Redmi Note 5 Pro and does not feel huge and bulky.It feels very premium to hold Honor 8X and you and your friends will be amazed to see the shiny reflective back.This phone has raise to wake feature. So if you pick up your phone, your phone will unlock within 1 second. You don't even need to press the power button. I bet you will use the fingerprint scanner in dark only.Also you can answer a call by raising your phone to your ear. You don't need to press or swipe the green answer call buttonPeople having small hands and small fingers may face problems using the phone with one hand.Super Slow motion at 480fps is greatOverall it is a good, innovative and futuristic phone and it is one of the best smartphone under ₹15000.If you did not find Realme 2 Pro good and interesting, you should go for Honor 8X	5
24517	Nothing to dislike. But I didn't get the headset	5
24518	Not as much	1

24532	The design is premium, picture quality is awesome, easy to carry due to its size and design. However, I had started facing some issues with it like battery was draining a lot. Sometime it took more than 5 hours to get fully charge. Also, after 1 week only apps started crashing.Tried reset but no help so I returned the phone, but yeah the design of the phone is pretty sexy.	3
24533	Build quality is superb. But lil disappointed with battery.	5
24534	First of all i love this phone as nobody can satisfy you in this world.After using i am providing this pro and consPros :1. Better than chinese phone. I purchased this by exchanging mi 3s prime.2. Display is the main attraction i.e. size, colour etc i think u can get such things in 30 k phone.3. Music speaker is very nice.4. Strong mobile can last so many years.5. Camera is very nice. I dont know why people given wrong reviews about camera.Cons. 1. Battery back up is poor.2. LG UI is not upto the mark.3. Heating sometime.4. No led notification light.5. Face sensor is like a joke.6. No fingerprint sensor.Apart from this i like the phone because i was using mi last 1 yr and i faced so many problems...if u ask me shall i buy lg next time i will say yes.Simply its a powerful phone. LG may solve some of basic problem after some updates release.	3
24535	Sound quality is to good and battery life is ameging picture quality is good but not good to samsung mobile	5

24567	The phone went defective as no calls could be heard. Pathetic customer support service.	1
24568	Even though it has a weaker processer than Poco F1, it still out perform most of the modern phone. 4 GB RAM and 64 GB storage is a sweet stop and sufficient for day to day tasks.Initial battery life is good. If you use it heavily for gaming then battery will loose capacity (30% or so) within first few months of use.Display is gorgeous but has a pale pinkish collour hue and isn't exactly white (on my device) but it doesn't bother you unless you are comparing side by side with another phone.It's a big phone but really well built and doesn't bother at all.	5
24569	All is good but camera quality in night mode its not good	4

24574	I brought this phone for 13500/- on offer. Nice look, good camera, display is ok. Camera is better than redmi note5pro in some aspects, because note5pro add some artificial colors. In on8 photos are in natural color. Samsung OS is user friendly. worth for 13500/-. Better than chines brands. classy product. Go for it.READ MORE	5

24579	Not good many falut in mobile	1
24580	I got this phone wih a price tag 7000 after a exchanging it my old moto G3 ,so if you are heavy gamer then plese dont go for it.otherwise for mild user then its a best phone in this price range.some of the user complaining about battery back up of this phone ,but believe me guys no phone give proper back up while you use internet in 4g.so battery back totally depend on your usage.Another key point to mention that its a Made in India product😀.	5
24581	Phone is awesome pictures quality is to good sound is so loud but battery life is little less overall mi A2 is so nicemobile	5
24582	Its very good, working smooth	5
24583	The phn feels awsm to hold and use. I got it for 15.5K ... Best in this range...	5
24584	Good smooth phone. No heating. Fingrr print sensor an face recognition super	4
24585	Picture quality is awful. I can't understand how different techies on you tube provided such a good feedback. The camera is hell, selfie loving guys is gonna hate it. Primary camera only good if held still. YouTube videos I compared to my 1plus 3t and I can see a huge difference in the quality and color. Battery backup is good , design is unmatchable at this price range ,display size is good but the display quality is cheap. I would recommend not buying this phone and rather go for note 5 pro which has better camera and better display and comes about 2500 cheaper than this phone. If looks and design is all you are looking for ..then honor 8x is the best phone for u	2
24586	Vry long battery life, faster net surfing, good quality screen ❤ , gt compliments on it's screen quality , overall nice experience	5
24587	Every thing is better at this price	5
24588	Battery dies by the end of the day	5

24590	Camera is excellent , amazing picture quality .Nice sound clarity .And outstanding battery performance..	5
24591	Xiaomi has been time and again belting out flagship products at par competitive market rate. The Redmi 6 pro lives upto its expectation with decent picture quality and battery life. Brought it for my spouse and she is delighted to have an upgrade from Samsung S Duos. Great offering from Mi!	4
24592	Good but battery performance is low	5
24593	The one thing in this phone in like the Dolby sound.picture are not so good	4
24594	Great Phone But, Camera Not That Much Good	4
24595	Very bad picture quality.	1
24596	Don't buy this product. MI's Proprietary MIUI is stable that what they give on android one. This phone is not upto the mark and has a lot of bugs. Usually the proximity sensor, the ambient display/ adaptive brightness don't work properly and the battery is terrible needs charge 2 times in a day with normal usage. Not at all satisfied with this deal. However the good thing is U get a decent camera with this handset. and that's probably the only decent thing.	2
24597	Picture quality is very good but sound is little bit noisy	4
24598	Very fast phone	5
24599	Very good mobile...except the sound quality is bad. Perfance wise it is very fast a day the mobile is handy.  Recommended at this price range.	4
24600	Nice phone in the given price range... better than Chinese phones	5
24601	Improve the camera and picture quality give an update regarding to camera	4
24602	By launching this, finally MI has to think on its product with similar price range..	4
24603	It's a good product.	4
24604	Value for money. Met my expectations that i had after reading the device's configuration and its reviews.	5
24605	Battry back up issue small battery other wise good	3
24606	Thats...osm phone...I like...this...phone	5
24607	It is very fast and camera quality is not very good but it is good.	5

24609	Superb phone at this price a real competitor to xiomi phones	5
24610	best for use	5
24611	Battery was not up to level . Rest everything was gud	5
24612	Battery life is based on how you are using your phone,it gives around a full day backup  in one time charging.picture quality is awesome.	5
24613	Except selfie camera, everything great..	4
24614	Everything is good only lacks finger lock sensor	4
24615	I just love dis phone tbh.... best phone ever more then I phone... 👌	5
24616	Camera is too good. Battery life is ok..could be more efficiat with 4k mah. overall a good phone to buy at this cost.	5
24617	The reviews here are false , it's a very poor phone poor front camera , lagging processor totally waste of money . If you read reviews you will find contents similar with just names changed . You have only 22 GB rom and 1.5 GB RAM available for actual use . It has got heating issues too . If you bought pray you will be able to return it and if you have not bought it don't buy .	1
24618	Nice product thanks for Amazon.	5
24619	It's does not heat at all yet I used it all day	4
24620	Awsome phone in this price and both the camera are ultimate	5

24637	Value for money redmi 6 pro under 11k price segment good thing. But I notice front camera more noise in low light condition it's too bad	4
24638	Full HD display notch under 11k was what i was searching for, so it didn't disappoint me at all.	5
24639	Good battery life. Has decent camera. Sound quality is good. Large screen looks awesome. Worth the price. Also looks stunning in hands.	4
24640	Worth for money & military standard quality	5

24642	Good phone , amazing features and solid battery	5
24643	Full Vision Display 18:9 best in class	5
24644	Its good in less price....	5
24645	Not worth the amount. Full vision bla bla is BS. Phone is narrow. Could have been wide screen. I tried to return the phone and spoke to multiple Amazon customer service staff. They were polite but that was not useful to me.My first phone on Amazon and I had a terrible experience. Staff said we should look at the product before I buy. I'm saying what is the use of buying online when I can go to a store.Surely not worth 13k.	3
24646	Amazing 😊	5
24647	Another Good product from MI	4
24648	Awesome performance...	5
24649	Picture qualify is not so good its not up to the mark. While taking selfie blur image coming.	4
24650	The best	5
24651	Picture quality is not so good but average	5
24652	It's a good Mobile for that price, decent performance, display is very nice, very handy with the size and design, looks good. Camera is good in daylight, selfies under a tube light indoor could be not that impressive. Snaps in dim light is pretty bad. Performance is good but with gaming or multiple applications and continues usage phone gets little warm but that is fine. Battery back up isn't that great.	4
24653	Out dated mob in this price camera is only 5 mp so as this Price this product is Just average	1
24654	Okay okay Budget phone	5
24655	Chutya phone	2
24656	Pic quality is good but not compare to note 5 proSounds great	4
24657	Battery is very good camera nice sound is very high but sd card slot not available body are excellent slim body and lock is very nice	5
24658	large display, camera performance and gaming experience.You must increase battery power in this segment...	4
24659	not as expected at this price....camera disappointed....over contrast & coloursScreen excellent ..performance very good ....Battery Life Good....Out of 64 gb will get 54 gb space...lots of preinstalled apps...user interface not better than MIUI....Price should be around 11k to 12k....Nothing else to say...	4
24660	Camera not working properly	1
24661	Superb mobile phone with excellent sound quality and good camera quality in taking picture in day time. Really Best deal .	4
24662	All are good. Go for it	5
24663	battery drain so fast	1
24664	Good picture quality and images	5
24665	"A device packed with glossing style and snappy UI. Though Sound output and front camera quality is a big let down. No ""Native video calling"" is another compromise. Choice is yours: if you are craving for outer looks then go for it else there are plenty of other options"	1
24666	Very Good product bt the charger is no working.......	3
24667	A good phone in this budget.	4

24678	Really loved this product.	5
24679	I bought this phone on offer price 12990 worth for this price tag, but actual 16999 is too costly for this specification. Using it for past one week i do not see any issues so far.Display is awesome.Face recognition is plus in this segment, it works very well in brighter areas.Camera is averageI recommend this phone for normal phone usersThis phone is not for gamer or who needs high performance.	4
24680	Poor battery lifeThe phone is very good at this price point fast process sufficient storage excellent camera gives quality pictures but at last not with battery performance as MI known for long lasting battery backup but this phone really shucks at this point hardly perform 4 - 5 hours at average usages. Get charged in just 1. 5 hrs from 0 to 100% but I would prefer even 3hrs of charging time, if I get 12hrs backup.	3
24681	Ok super	5
24682	Not happy don't buy this phone  mike stopped working on second day not expecting this kind of product	1
24683	Don't buyIssue in Mi A2 check below steps1) plugged in earphone with connector2) play any music3) then go to settings and change ringtone value4) music will play in speaker after notification played	2
24684	Picture quality is better,speaker is given at topof the phone sound is ok, one of the best thing about this phone is battery life it lasts for long time.Heating issue while charging.	5

24698	Really nice oneThankd	5
24699	There is no VoLTE in this mobile. You pay 19k for a mobile and you don't get even the basic features which are available for even a 10k mobile. Nokia sucks. No clear updates either	1
24700	Yeah, if you break the delicate rear glass you have to pay minimum 5.4k.	2
24701	I expected less, got just what I needed.Just make sure you turn of/reboot your phone sometimes guys! It helps performance amd connectivity a lot!	5
24702	Very good ph	5
24703	Got it for 16k with 6 GB ram and 128 GB storageI don't know why so many YouTuber complain about the battery lifeWell I think it's decent enough to last a day but alongside it's charging speed is fast enoughPlus the performance is great to handle any sort of games be it PUBG or anything I can play PUBG at HD setting with medium frame rates and it will consume only about 10% of battery for a full 30 min sessionThe camera is the greatest USP of the device photos are good enough in day or low light conditionOverall a good product at a decent price	5

24705	18:9 OMG it's awesome 5.5 inch display doesn't feel like a big phone. a friend bought S8 with same aspect ratio and this Q6 reminds me of S8. Face detection works well in medium to low light... In dark you can either use PIN or add the location to Trusted place or use KnockOn feature to unlock... Keep in mind that recently announced IPhone X worth almost 1L ₹ too doesn't have Fingertouch unlock feature Camera quality is good and Sound is decent. Customized Android Nougat looks fresh unlike stock android which I am using Nexus 6P. Totally worth it to buy	5

24722	Looks good, is light, decent battery life, turbo charging is great. Camera quality is poor, you wouldn't want to take pictures with this one.	4
24723	Phone heated so much, even faced problem  to hold the phone, while charging and video recording or screen recordingI complained it but technisian visit after 10 days, (complition of 10 days returning policy) and said it is often, no problem at allIts disgustingAfter sell service is very poor and you have to keep the product with problems	2

24731	""" Classy mobile"" awesome feel to hold this device. Catchy look. You can extraordinary features."	5
24732	Handset is ergonomically perfect but camera quality is very poor. Even headphones are of very bad quality.	2
24733	It’s an awesome phone for the price. Very few phones come with SD660 at this price and has a similar camera clarity. The only disadvantages are the lower battery capacity and the lack of expandable memory card holder. Built and display are better than the competition and the Android One promise of two year guaranteed updates makes it a safe buy.	5
24734	Handset was good in low price...must buy	5
24735	No for good only for mi fans mobbe not for special mobile others resion old design.old caimra old price. Hii	4
24736	I m not like this mobile	2

24739	Product is Gud.But didn't receive purchase bill.	4
24740	Its just simply great for the price... I still cannot find any other phone in this range which can compete woth this phone. What is best is that although many phone can giv u greay spec for this price but till nobody is able to giv such a awesome build quality at this price. Metal n glass is truely premium. Display is adequately big n immersive. EMUI has improved so much and so fluid and it just keep getting better n better. Camera is good specially the night shot. Last but not least is the impressive battery 🔋 life. Simply great combination of all usefull feature.	5
24741	Proximity sensor not working properly, over heating after share any data. If I called to Amazon he can't replacement... Don't buy A2 and any product from Amazon	1
24742	Nice phone but front camera not good	3
24743	It is good phone with awesome specifications  but sometimes the phone has bugs here and there might be software issue may be it will get solved updates and pubg mobile game works smoothly but lags often don't know why. Otherwise its a good phone at this price and is value money . The camera is the best thing of this phone and the pure Android feels good . And got the Android pie update yesterday only , I update the review soon	3

24751	It is a great looking smartphone but the processor is not that good for gaming and it is fragile and u can't play pubg in hd graphics	3

24758	Overall good phone but battery is worst	3
24759	Small display	5
24760	All you need to know before buying this phone:[Review update: I really wanted to like this phone, but had to return it due to the cons mentioned below. Now you make an informed decision.]Pros:- Great camera quality ( 20+12 at this price, just wow)- Stock Android- Perfect Screensize- Looks sleek and good- The phone works blazing fast (thanks to the great processor+stock android)- Fingerprint sensor responds very quickly, never faced an issue- The speaker sound is pretty good (music). It doesn't distort much even on high volumeCons [For which I returned the phone]- Wi-fi connectivity issues: Wi-fi kept dropping and disconnecting for me every few mins. Even after a replacement, the issue did not resolve.- Battery backup is average. It's not very bad, but in today's world, there is a certain need for improvement.- Many users report proximity issue. I didn't exactly notice that, but wi-fi issues weighed me down. So basically there are some bugs/faults which may vary phone to phone.- And then the things which you already know before buying, but are still planning to buy this phone:  - No headphone jack  - No fast charge  - No expandable storage	3
24761	Using phone since 3 months and working perfectly fine.you can watch movies, you can play games without any hassle. Phone doesn't get hang. Screen touch is also very convenient. Also face detection works perfect 👍	5
24762	Honor has nailed it this time; the honor 8X is an enviable piece of art to hold and behold. The performance is seamless and Kirin 710 is truly something worthy enough to fall in love with <3.	5
24763	Awesome allrounder mobile at this price tag is really a true value for money.	5
24764	This phone is good in every respect except that signal reception and voice drops frequently. The Phone's main purpose is to be able to talk. However, voice drop makes the whole experience bad.	3
24765	Awesome phone love it.	5
24766	☺️The front 24mp camera is not as expected! Even Samsung's 8mp camera is better😉The battery life shows complete justice to 3000mah	4
24767	Where is the notification😠😠. Honor 9n is lot better then this	1
24768	The  outdoor picture quality of honor8x was awesome....	4
24769	Worst phone ...gets hang very often font buy	1
24770	Battery life is worst. Not even working for 5-6 hours. seems to be issue with phone within 30 days itself	1
24771	Very usefull	4
24772	Battery runs 8-12hrs, awesome camera and performance phone. Only sometime while calling screen light not off but not a major issue. Not any other issue.	5
24773	Overall phone performance is good. Just a little disappointed with the display size.	4
24774	DIslike	1
24775	Good Display in the budgeted segment. Only one weak point is no finger print scanner. One of the best build quality with best price.	5
24776	It's best deal in just 15,000Camera quality is too good but when i try to shoot slow motion video it shows dark videoSound quality is awesome with loud clear voice output speakerHardware is OK no slow no hangSenser, face recognition and other options are bestOverall its good phone with lots of features	5
24777	value for money... dont care about negative review go for it	5
24778	I don't have the option to give the rating less than 1 star. Heating Problem, Camera Not upto the mark. LOOKS GOOD.	1
24779	Highly recommended	5
24780	best phone in this segment	5
24781	Three finger screenshot not available.The network catches less.Sometimes it gets very hot.Automatic network turns on when talking on mobile data turns on when light is turned on	4
24782	Touch screen not so sensitive	2
24783	Awesome deal I got from Amazon.	5
24784	Volte mobile means video call facility in sim and mobile too. But here is no video call facility in this phone.Video recording quality is not good (blurry).	1
24785	Design(+) Well built(+) The fingerprint reader on the back is in a natural position to comfortably unlock with either index finger.Display(+) Contemporary, tall 18:9 display, brings the Mi Android One series up to modern standards(-) Brightness levels for the display could have been better - it's not the easiest phone to use under sunlightSoftware(+) One of the best parts about the phone is of course the fact that it is part of the Android One series, which should mean guaranteed Android updates for at least 2 years + a stock, simple version of Android, with no unnecessary bloatPerformance(+) Butter smooth performance backed by a powerful Snapdragon 660 chipset, hardly seen at this low a price bracketCamera(+) Stellar set of dual cameras on the rear - arguably the joint best at this price point, at par with the excellent Redmi Note 5 Pro - take nice photos in good and low light alike, and the bokeh shots too come out well(+) Very good selfie camera, with good bokeh shots - overall one of the best selfie cameras in this price bracketAudio(+) Very loud loudspeaker, one of the best in this price bracket(-) No 3.5mm jack, so if you want to use your existing standard-jack headphones, you will need to use an adapter (included in the box)Battery(+) Fast charging support(-) The battery life could have been better - it will last you the day with moderate use, but it's not as good as the best of the competitionConclusionOn the whole, the Mi A2 is a good, solid phone in this price bracket and you won't go wrong with it - it will compete strongly against the likes of Redmi Note 5 Pro (a bit cheaper, but doesn't have stock Android), and Honor Play (faster, better for gaming, but loses on the software)	4

24794	1. ScreenFirst of all this notch screen,its a full HD+ display doing justice with this notch hype,and actually this is the best thing about the phone,super bright and crisp colors,I,comepared it real me 2 pro,it has only HD display so you can only run max up to 720 content.So its a really good display deal at this price point with notch and nearly edge to edge screen.2. PerformanceIt has snapdragon 625 with clockspeed of 2.0GHz and adreno 506 GPU,if you dont get it than it means you can nicely run PUBG in low.And dont buy the 3/32 option,its not worth it,4/64 is worth that extra 2k stretch,this how you can use SD 625 to its limits.Its comes andorid Oreo 8.1 and you will get an update of android P.MiUi 10 update is coming soon3. CameraThis is the only down side I found till now.Its really bad and outdated,primary camera is 12+5 mp and there is nothing in the image quality from you can say is a dual camera,there a portrait mode but its just a name with very little work.front camera is even worse,its a 5mp single lens and I think its the same xiomi is giving from redmi 4.Not at all adequate.And no portrait mode on front camera.Though I am not a camera person All I can say about this camera is Functional.That is it.4.BatteryIt is a 4000mah lithium polymer battery which is fairly adequate for 1.75 day of use over wifi and 1 day over mobile data.Takes 1.5 hr to full charge from 0.Battery life is really good.At the end it is a good experience for me because latest android good processor decent RAM ROM,and a good better life to support all this.But Camera is not good I repeat camera is really not good.(Spell check and autocorrect has done everything to ruin this review together, still somehow I managed to finish this review,so please Avoid grammatical and spelling mistakes.And appreciate the efforts by an upvote.)	4
24795	This phone picturw quality is superbb and sound alsobbut battery is normal like redmi note 4 and 5 not different . But this phone is awsm redmi give us notch with low buget and i enjoyed this notch	4

24797	Great phone....	5
24798	Good value for money. All rounder in Camera, performance and build quality. Expect honor will provide EIS for camera soon via update.	5
24799	Been using this for a 2 weeks now... And I must say the phone is awesome. No heating or lagging the only negative I see is the camera. People who prefer selfies or good rear camera this is not the phone for you... Ram management and processor is good.	5
24800	after 13 days ... touch not working properlyafter 15 days ... screen  light apne aap change  ho rhi h.. now finly  phone off ho gya... charging nhi ho rhi... phone completely off . ...  😶🤐😯😓	1
24801	New moto g6 is outstanding within this price range.Specially when we talk about a premium looks, c- type charger with fast charging, splash proof and Dolby audio supported.Sound quality is not that appropriate but it's good.	5

24803	So so good..	5

24807	P20 lite mobile battery is not good.. Mobile hang once in a everyday please not buy it.. In this budget u can buy oppo f9 pro	1
24808	After 10 days use:Looks - 5 . I have the blue version . Looks premium. Back glass does not catch finger prints easily.Build quality -5 . Feels tough. Display, back glass & camera lens scratch-proof, except finger print scanner region.Display - 5. Auto-brightness works perfectBattery - 5 . Lasts a whole day with moderate gaming, music & browsing. The phone gets warm while playing games, but not substantial. Though it cools off also very fast too. Charging is slow- takes about 2.5 hrs.Gaming - 5 . I play NFS No limits - works absolutely fineUser interface - 5. There many good shortcut options. 90% of the pre-installed apps can be uninstalled. Rest I disabled them.Face unlock - Fast & reliable. Does not work in low light conditionsSignal Quality - 5 Never had an issue with the signalCamera - 4 . Image stabilization not present.	5
24809	Just two weeks over blue screen is appearing and rebooting happening frequently.Highly disappointed.	3

24812	Battery drains faster even for normal use unless you keep it on battery save mode for forever.Camera quality is also not good compared to the even lower version of Mi Phones.The sound is ok, but not so good. Overall spend 2-3k more and get a better phone like Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 if size is not an issue.For me size was the only matter i bought this.	3
24813	Worst product..please exhange it	1
24814	Mobile has got good features.quality of photography is marvellous.has got additional feature to see preview of the photo. taken and finer crop adjustments. are there.all sides finishing iss smooth.value for money.	5

24817	V good phone	4
24818	Front camera vary nice. Display also nice. Small phone with small notch. Back camera avg. Battery avg.its has no quiz charging but charged fast compare to other phone.speaker avg. Pricing little bit high. Not worth for money. 15k  is good deal for this phone.thank you amazon for quiz returns	3
24819	Best average mobile	5

24822	Nice product in budgets.	4
24823	Battery charging not standing at more time	4
24824	I liked everything about it till now. Though I haven't used much. Lets see how it works.😋Excited and nervous too, hope everything goes well.😍 Thanks Flipkart.READ MORE	5
24825	First of all the design is awesome and feels very premium holding it my hand.Camera- Best in the segment there is no phone which compete with this phone under 30kPerformance - It's very smooth and since it's Android one the phone runs very smoothBattery - Average battery you have to charge it twice a day.	5
24826	The notch display is very good and optimized for gaming.The sound quality is very good and picture quality is very well.Battery lifeis very good.When I play PUBG the battery goes 100% to 0% in 6 to7 hours.So this is a best budget mobile.	5
24827	Mostly I liked the camera features as light painting , silky water and the notch screen is look like very awesome, FHD display quality	5
24828	Good product,  awesome featuresPerfect for a heavy use.	5
24829	I want duplicate mobile bill please	4
24830	This is my review after using from 15/08 to 25/08:Snapdragon 660 does almost everything you through at it. Runs PUBG with normal graphics recommendation. While switching between apps, doesn't reload most of the apps and is quick enough.The phone doesn't get warm during moderate use but while charging it has heating issue.A full charge takes a little more than two hours and lasts 7-8 hours in normal usage, meaning if you are playing lite games and using your social apps but if you are just making calls and browsing kind of stuff, it can go as long as 12 hours may be. Battery is a real drawback for this device, being a mi device it wasn't expected. Also seeing the price deferance between the normal mi charger and the mi quick charger I'm disappointed that mi didn't provide a quick charger.Face unlock and fingerprint scanner are fast enough but notification light doesn't change colour.Ram management you can see unlocking developer option and you'll find 1.3gb of free ram approx. Split screen is there but couldn't find one handed mode.Memory cannot be extended but 64 gb rom is okay with me, approx 49.5 gb is usable.Speaker is LOUD enough.Headphone jack is an issue but the type c to 3.5 cable works well and problem can be sorted out with bluetooth headset.On the launch event thickness was mentioned with proud, but the camera bump is itself as thick as the phone. The case provided with it protects it well though.Its my frist android one and stock android is great...Some apps like file maneger from miui can be installed.Last but not the least, camera, it's a beauty you cannot get better. I have become a fan of the camera.Conclusion: Battery backup could have been better!! 😪 I'll suggest A2 over any android one, priced ₹1k less 😜	4
24831	Perfect superb and nice	5
24832	Battery life is better. But picture quality not bad and sound quality laud.	4
24833	This is not a flagship but a very good value for money at this price. Very good size and can be used by single hand. However, mi note 5 pro is a better version cheaper by a few thousand rupees.	4

24846	facing problem for my Nokia 6.1 (TA 1089) . This problem started occurring since V2.22C update. VoLTE not working since the last update and it is a huge problem as Jio SIM works only in VoLTE mode. It used to work before the V2.22C update but now calls just won't go from the mobile. Request Nokia to fix this problem quickly.	1
24847	It's nice	5
24848	Product is build good but it has serious issue of hanging	1
24849	Good picture quality but very low sound, even with earphones. Battery life is just OK so far. Phone is of correct size, neither big NIR small. Good user interface and plenty of customisation options.	4
24850	I have been using this phone for 20 days and my review areAmazon delivery was lightning. The phone came 3 days before committed date. Evening 7.30pm, I placed order and next day 8.25am I got the delivery.Coming to the phonePros1. The display is huge and super clear. The back glass side gives some good feeling. None of my friends has so good looking phone.2. The phone is quick is unlocking, face and finger lock. However face lock I felt something has delay.3. Processing : the phone is quick in all the actions, be in gaming or normal usage. No. Complaints.4. Camera: this is the best part of this phone. The picture quality is super good. The pictures does not distorts even after zooming. Also you install Google camera and have a much better experience, as api2 is enabled in this phone. I have attached photos.4. Battery: very surprising. I have been using this phone for 15 days and it's giving 40 hrs of battery. After one day of use in evening it shows  50% battery with mobile data always on, hot-spot on for approx 4 hrs in a day and heavy usage.5. Overall its a most best phone to buy in this category, it even competes the high end phone like oneplus 6tCons1. C type USB is missing.2. Battery charging takes more than 2 hrs as fast charging is not available here.3. Face unlock - I found sometimes lagging.	5

24890	I had returned this mobile. Because mobile was hitting with very poor battery performance.	2
24891	A budget phone under 20k. The looks are killer and battery is outstanding. My first phone getting a such battery life even after rapid use.Camera is preety good but not great. Front camera is quite satisfactory. Rear camera contrast is high so pic are warm in nature.Sound is pretty good and so as headphone.Battery is 15 out of 10. Using more than a month and its beyond my expectation.Screen and looks is as Top Class. Notch is also eye catching. But face sensor is not that strong, where finger print plays its role perfectly.Over all best phone in this budget and kudos to Huawei power management system. Kirin is smart enough. None other the less becoming a Huawei fan :D	5
24892	Everything is good. Only thing is the lag in opening applications when you load the phone with apps. Speaker sound is low.	4

24911	The first ever dual camera smartphone of Samsung with infinity super amoled display. The best thing in this smartphone is the crystal clear display and its camera. It has got 16+5mp dual rear camera with f1.7. The pictures are crystal like clear with Auto focus. The front camera with adjustable led flash is also amazing. 4gb Ram leads to no lagging at all even when it's came to high end game like Asphalt 9, PUBG etc. The fingerprint sensor is blazing fast. Face unlock also works properly. And the best thing is its looks, the Sapphire blue looks very much elegant. Beautiful, sleek and bazeless design gives it a premium look. Overall this phone is beast. Value for money, go fot it. After all, Samsung is Samsung 😀👍.Special Thanks for Amazon, for it's fastest and service as usual and for the best offer.	5

24935	Awesome phone from Huawei.. Everything looks good camera quality under 15k is really good.. It also displays 4k videos.. But battery drains fast 8% per hour even in standby..	5
24936	I bought the phone thought the processor will handle games but quite dissappointed with it and at this price range I don't think u should buy display camera and stylish phone is good but when it comes to the performance its not goodGames like Pes pubg can't even run at medium graphics I think huawei has gone too harsh at pricing and priced allotSo I got wrong so I don't want to have any other my friend go wrong better go for Xiomi as its performance is completely better then it and is quite discounted price.And if performance doesn't matter and u need a stylish and phone which challenge IPhone Samsung on built quality then its just great the Mirror Finish Is just Eyespopping So camera performance is Quite good compared to other mobiles in this price range especially the front camera is brilliant.So overall I don't refer to buy coz 9nly built quality and style is not to be considered performance also matters so I don't think buying at such high price will be good idea.Hence this I my honest rewiew for Huawei P20 Lite	3
24937	Excellent Product, as I am using this for almost 3 months. Fully satisfied with the performance especially Battery Backup. Worth buying this product at such low price. Recommended for everyone. Go for it guys....	4

24958	As for now its good When you use continuouslyNear the speaker buttonsIts heating moreHow to resolve this issue	3
24959	Purchased this in the second week of October. Have been using it for two weeks now. Got the October security patch in the first week of use itself. The build quality is very nice given the price. A nicely built and good looking metal unibody. Good quality lcd screen. Clear flat sound from the speaker. The OS runs smoothly almost all the time. But there are some software glitches now and then. Sometimes the notification drawer comes down spontaneously, etc. But still it's now and then. The software is butter smooth otherwise. The power button double tap gesture for camera doesn't work well. It just gives a blank white screen most of the times. Talking about the camera, it gives you the best possible pictures you can expect within this prize range.The only thing unimpressive about this thing is the battery life. It will give you one day of usage, flat. The battery drains a lot while idle. It's a software issue it seems. Might get fixed with the Pie update.So to summarize, it's a nice pure android experience with a good camera with a caveit of poor battery life.Points to note:1. The phone is smooth and stutter free all the time.2. There's no headphone jack. But a type-c to 3.5 mm adapter is included in the box3. The notification light is single coloured. Only white4. There's no heating at all for regular use5. The sound output from the single bottom speaker is decent, but flat.Overall it's a really nice package given the price of 15k or below.	4

Only good thing is phone has notch display which is very good in this price range	4
24986	Hello i purchased this phone in Oct17 and realised i did a unknown mistake by selecting this phone. Firstly batterybackup seems to less than 2000mh. It drain out very quickly less than a day even without internet. Secondly network bar fluctuate and not good as we all expect.Heating is another issur. Screen resolution camera is ok but not good to solve the purpose of a phone.Now again in 2018 i saw another problem..this phone fails to do multitasking...Trust me i hv purchased MI MAX 2 for my wife ..though it is big but excellent in performance, multitasking, graphics and battery backup..  By the way i am not an MI employee and not doing sales promotion. Just to make u aware about dismal performance of lg q6	1
24987	First of all thanks to Amazon for 1 day delivery. I bought this phone for 13499/- which is super value for money. The phone is great and looks very premium with the glass body. The display is awesome. Back camera is great but the front camera could have been better. Battery will easily last for a day with moderate usage. No heating or lag during playing games like PUBG and Asphalt 9.The 2 things which I didn't like about this device is that it doesn't have a USB-C type port and the next being the speaker output. I won't say it's bad, but it's just average and not soo good and loud.So I'll say guys that go for this phone. It's awesome in this price range.	4
24988	return my phone	5
24989	Device heating problem,C pin charger required can't use regular one,C pin to 3.5mm jack connector required for the use of headphone,memory card slot not available to this device, not worthful	3

25000	I received MI A2 today morning -Aug 17 (Mentioned that it will reach from Aug 14 to Aug 17 but reached on Aug 17 upper limit. ) and I ordered this on Aug 9.  So in terms of delivery - it's poor but if we talking about phone then it's awesome.What I like :1) Battery power / Management  - I started using this very heavily since morning like installation of apps / updates/ camera testing etc and still have 15 % batter left after continuous using of around 7 hour. So battery is 5/5.  I didn't tested on GAME - So it may vary but normal uses it's good.2) Camera : Front / Rear : Both are best : 5 out of 53) Build quality : 5/54) Screen size and quality : 5/55) Processor : 5/56) Stock android : Yes I deleted all the MI Apps including File Manager and Remote so it's now around stock android. : score : 4 out 57) Type C / fast Charge: 5/58) Voice quality over phone calls : 5/59) Brightness of screen : Generally many news / blogs / videos shared that brightness is very low. So this is a rumour. This phone have a mode under display called : Adaptive brightness is disabled by default. But when you enabled that then it's showing very dimmed. In this case we need to adjust the brightness from main control.What I Don't like:1) sound quality : Sound quality seems very cheap and not enjoyable if we are listening music2) Double tap screen awake option : This option is not available (or unable to find). Let me know if anyone find thisPS: MI A2 launch already said that no headphone 3.5 mm jack but connector via typ c to 3.5 mm jack is there. So don't complain after buying it.	5
25001	Good look . Good performance. Hanging a bit. Can't connect to pc	3
25002	Not a great phone or not a worst phone , but it is not a value for money phone .Pros:Display is good.User interface is just OK.Cons:Camera is not that great.Takes longer time to charge. No quick charge.Wide selfie images are not at all good.software must be improved ...You can make omlets when data is on.Dificult to get Temper glass outside and very costly online.Cost should be around 9000-10000.	3

25015	Don't expect much xaomi doesn't done justice in it's dual camera. I bought for 9k so it's good at this price range.	3
25016	I just wanted to mention cons abt the phone which I experienced. MI forgot to include these minor but most important applications. Like-Voice recorder-Inbuilt doc scanner-Many more to miss when exploredNo separate audio jack (WHERE I CAN'T USE THE HEADPHONES IF MOBILE CHARGE IS LOW, BIGGEST FLAW)MI oly concentrated on increasing camera features n display, and forgot to include fingerprint option to take pictures.I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED BUYING THIS PHONE, WHERE I CAN GO for low configuration mobiles with less prices.	1

25096	I just got it 3hours back.. And guess what the look of the mobile is extremely premium. And the build quality is awesome. Camera is quite good. This is my first review for this mobile. I will give more reviews after 3days	5
25097	i like to this phone rear camera best Qwality but front camera is not better its ok battery backup is very good	5
25098	I never review any products but this product in particular has compelled me to do so.This device in my opinion is the best smartphone in the 15k segment.One of the best performers while gaming, super smooth UI, and even get an option to enable app drawer. With all of that said, this phone has the best front camera and one of the best rear facing cameras in this segment. The only con this camera has is that it doesn't have EIS, there is a possibility that we may get that in future updates. So not that big of an issue for me at least.And reviewers on YT have said that this phone's speaker isn't upto the mark. Whereas in my opinion it's great, yes it has a single speaker but it's quite loud. If I compare the speaker with Redmi Note 5 pro's dual speakers then it obviously has lower volume. That is expected when you are comparing two speakers with one, but it still is loud and if anyone says that you might have problems in hearing the ringtone then that person or reviewer must be lying. Ringtone is loud enough to be heard clearly even on Delhi's roads.And last but not the least, the biggest plus point of this device is its display and its looks. This device doesn't just look premium but it feels premium too and the massive 6.5 inch fhd+ display is beautiful, again the best in the segment. Nokia 6.1+ might come close in the display & looks department though.The colours are well saturated and by default they are quite vibrant, if you don't like vibrant colours then you change that in display settings by simply selecting the normal settings.And idk why people complain about notch displays, I loved the notch display. If you prefer a notchless display then you can simply disable it from the settings. It's quite neat imo. And a few other things I forgot to talk about are the bezels on this device are almost negligible, it has triple sim slot with dual 4G VOLTE. Great signal reception and ohh one thing I really wanted, which is the multicolor notification light, in the notch. So having a notch is not really an acceptable excuse to exclude the notification led.Overall I am in love with this device and everything about it, if anyone is looking for a great smartphone in the 15k price bracket then go for this you won't regret. And use the case provided in the box as this phone has a glass back!	5
25099	DONT BUY THIS MOBILE.I had bought this in aug'17.1. Poor network connectivity. I live in bangalore. Network issue like no connectivity or mobile not reachable and call not getting connected are all major issue faced2. Wifi. And net connectivity is poor . my network provider (airtel and Vodafone) did all the check and finally its because of the phone so nothing can be doneSo if you want a phone that looks good then go for it. Only issue is to make call, recieve call and low speed data and WiFi. This gets hanged every now and then. Amazon please do not endorse such lowsy product.	1
25100	Definitely the best android phone. Don't need to think second time. just go for it. Ull be more than satisfied	5
25101	The picture quality, camera, looks are all fantastic. Its a good phone if you are not concerned about your privacy.The application like MI video, music, file manager  have lot of recommendations and adds. Although you disable it in preference, it comes back after every update. There is no option to uninstall the update and force stop the app from preventing to run in the background.	3

25125	Bullock cart delivery by Amazon. Took almost 7 days to deliver the item. Reduced 1 star for that.What can I say about Q6. Though the specs are not great but look and feel is way better than China maal. The phone is very sturdy and smooth in handling. No heating issue observed. Dont know how other are using the phone and observing heat issue. The calls quality is great and no problem in reception. Call gets connected even with a single signal bar. Rear and front Camera is great. No hickups while using video calls. The only con is no equalizer setting in the phone and LG must provide a pathch for that. Then would be a great buy. Still I recommend the phone to other who are not gamers. For day to day usage its a great package.After 3 days use:Phone gets warm while browsing on mobile data.	4

25142	"Amazing phone, Amazing battery rest of all its a superb product, ""Mid Range Camera King""😊😍😘😎"	4
25143	Got it for 17 K in an offer. It's got really good camera for the price range. Battery is good so far, it lasts for the day. It's pretty slick. I got blue color and it looks good as well. All other specs are great in the price range. Go for it if you're looking for something worthwhile between 15-20 K	5
25144	A small scratch on screen I am totally disappointed with product	1
25145	It's very difficult to find what I liked.Do not buy this. It will frustrate you. Keeps on hanging , battery below average. Only good thing is the charger. Rest all is nonsense.  Even the earphones are below the quality what we get on local train. Slow phone with horrible camera quality.. negative rating should be enabled	1
25146	Good for the price	5
25147	The rear camera and the front camera are the factors which is a huge plus point for photography.In terms of battery, 3010 mAh is ok but not great if you're a gaming freak.C-type is a great introduction and may be the way forward but I badly miss the headphone jack. bettery & headphone jack are same. so if u charging a phone unfortunately u can not use headphone.if you're bored with custom UI and modified Android . If you're interested in using stoke Android with best camera and performance in this price range this is the best choice.	4
25148	Very good battery🔋 backup	4
25149	awesome phone...READ MORE	5
25150	Its not a phone, its a power bank. Writing this after using for a week.Battery: The 5000 mah battery lasts two days on normal usage and may even go beyond that for light users. The Fast charging is the best thing one can get for such a huge battery. Takes approx 2 hrs for 100% charging.Software: Android Oreo 8.1 (Jul-August software update patch). Pie not yet available.Physical overview: The device looks good with metal body. The finger print scanner is situated under the Motorola logo at ...READ MORE	4

25163	LG Q6 has tremendous heating  problem. I hv unsealed the box  and started the phone. Within 5 minutes of operation the upper frame is generating abnormal heat which anybody can feel once taken on the plam. This is not acceptable from such reputed brand like LG.The look and feel of the ph is excellent. But I hv rated 1 since the heating issue is  a major negative feature of the phone.	1
25164	Camera quality is best.But card slot is missing.	4
25165	I liked the look and the performance hasn't let me down yet.	5

25182	LG Q6 the best budget smartphone? Let’s find out.For starters it has a gorgeous 18:9 aspect display. The visibility out in sunlight is pretty decent even the colours are nice and punchy. So overall it has a wonderful display. Inside the phone you get SD 435 chipset coupled with 3 gigs of ram and 32 gb inbuilt Storage. Performance is pretty good, games run smoothly and you will face no problem while multitasking (the device gets a bit warm while extensive gaming). LG has done a great job in optimising this device. Speaking of the camera you get 13MP rear and 5MP front camera. Rear camera does a good job in well light conditions, but struggles a bit in low light, whereas the front facing camera is great (it’s one of the best in the segment). Other good features include dual sim support and a micro SD card slot (you can use 2 sims and a micro SD card simultaneously). One of the major cons of this device is lack of fingerprint scanner.Below are some quick pros and cons.::::::::::::::::::::::::::PROS:- Good performance.- Great display.- Decent build quality.- Great selfie camera.- Dual Sim and micro SD card support.:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::CONS:- Lack of fingerprint scanner.- A bit overpriced.- Battery life could have been better.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::FINAL VERDICT:In my opinion it’s a great offering from LG. I would say that it’s the best budget smartphone from a tier 1 company (it’s better than Samsung).It’s a great alternative for those who don’t trust the Chinese companies. It would have been great if it was priced a bit less (Chinese brands offer same features and performance for less than 10k). So overall it’s a decent offering from LG.[...]Thank you.	3

25221	Overall phone is good. Satisfy with phone......	4
25222	Battery drains too fast have to charge every 14 hours	4
25223	Phone is good but battery sucks. Even on general use it cant even sustain half day. Will certainly Not recommend this & reason is Poor Battery.	2
25224	nice one.	5
25225	Really light, really pretty. Its a powerpacked shiny piece in your hand, and feel free to flaunt every bit of it.Screen, processor, battery - all good at its price point. Disappointed by its camera though. Too much AI at work. In its aggressive attempt to beautify every photo, it takes away what was naturally beautiful in the first place. Use the pro-mode and take control in your hands.Ps: The charger pumps the juice back really fast... I like that.	5
25226	Just recieved now by Amazon one day delivery. Mobile is very slim and beautiful look wise.	5
25227	This product not very well	2

25234	Good phone with notch	4
25235	Hands down best camera and software experience in the price	5
25236	Worst camera.Sound not goodTakes 3 hours to charge batteryPicture clarity is goodBattery backup is good, lasts for 24-36hrs	3

25242	Great phone under Rs20000	5
25243	it has been just 1 month or so, and this device is giving me issue of speaker sound. speaker is not working, when i try to play audio of any platform either youtube or downloaded audio clips, it starts with normal speaker sound for only 0.5 seconds and then speaker stops working and I cannot hear anything from the speaker. I took it to service center and they were saying to take the backup as it will take 2-3 days to rectify this issue.  Honestly I did not expect this type of issue with motorola. Instead of repairing this device, motorola should provide a new handset to me. Right now device is with me as I have no other mobile to use as backup for 2-3 days. I am also going to write this issue to motorola. This is disgusting.	1
25244	My sister could use the face unlock, im surprised! The face unlock can be used with or without wearing my specs though i took my picture without my specs on...more and more surprises !!!!!	5
25245	Al portrait and al beauty not coming in selfiesAs advertised. Bill invoice not provided	3
25246	No no no..I have it in my hand but still a big NO..the basic feature its lacking is the battery life..am writing this review after using it for a month and trust me one vl be annoyed with it's battery drain..it doesn't stand for half day long..so it's kept for secondary purpose like camera only..in my experience it's a bad bad phone..I have to charge it till 100% thrice a day..not gud at all..my mistake is after seeing that feature I was blind for the cam..	1
25247	It's ok, worth of money	4
25248	I like only notch and phone look good and dislike in 13 k you have better option	4

25284	I have been using this for an yearHere are the basic Pros and Cons:-Pros:1.Processor is fast teeming with its 3Gb ram.2.Phone is sleek.3.Small games work smoothly but heavy games lag but very rarely.4.Display is very good as compared to other mid ranged phones.Cons:1.Camera quality is not upto the mark.2.Speakers are not good.3.No fingerprint sensor.4.Has only a Snapdragon 425 processor.Its a good phone for 12k but you should consider buying Moto, Redmi or Nokia	4

25306	The review is written after using for 2 weeks.Till date, I am very happy with all its features.- Very premium build quality and gives a nice feel to hold also very light in weight.- Camera quality is great, the front camera captures the best.- The rear camera seems to be good as well.- Battery charges at the rate of 1% per minute thus take almost 100 minutes to full charge. Also, battery lasts a full day with normal use.- The package comes with cheap quality headphones but that can be neglected when you have such a great phone in hand.	5
25307	This is a good mobile at this price.Pros : Good display, fast processing and large battery.Cons : Camera is good but nothing special having dual camera setup.	4

25355	Firstly i watched many reviews and videos and confused about pros and cons but believe me i am just a point less than a heavy user. I think this is best and undefeated in its price segment with new best kirin 710 CHIPSET and EMUI which provides a stock experience. And from my usage it provides heat free PUBG AND ASPHALT experience. Never think about lagging and heating. And once you use it you were amazed by its battery backup, looks, camera, UI,. believe me i didn't know any prons but till now i didn't find any cons in it except EIS which I think should be done with update	5
25356	I like it's so much	5
25357	Positives1. Design and Full vision display look good.2. Compact size and light weightNegatives1. No metal unibody, Plastic back cover.2. Cheap quality ear phones.3. No fast charging.4. Concern about heating issue.5. Bad front camera.	1

25462	Well thanks Amazon wanted to gift a mobile phone to wife had an old Asus phone which I sold for 6000 with excess cashback of 2000/- . So basically I got Moto g6 for 9500/- only . Now let's talk about phone well looks are gorgeous, sound superb , screen resolution awesome only drawback is camera it's just average as in current term it is lacking in camera battery is good not great, fast charger is good well overall better if you get mi phone but overall it is a good phone except camera.	4
25463	Picture quality is nice but the battery life is not good i bought this phn before a week but its not like a new phone battery is drained soon	2
25464	My wife has been using this phone ever since it was launched. She had complaints with every other phone she used but this is the best of the lot. The picture quality is good and the best thing is face unlock	5
25465	Phone is awesome. No worries. Take it	5
25466	Heated problems, headphone is not supporting via connector.	4
25467	Excellent product as described. Worth a buy. Dirt cheap comparing same product within the range	5

25470	not satisfactory as description	2
25471	This redmi 6 pro chargeing time over heating and performance average another one network problem	2
25472	I got this phone yeaterday and now i think after spending almost 24hours with this device here are my rewiews :1.Good phone is this budget.Features like face detections and location based 2.phone lock unlock are great.3.performance is good as far as price is concerned.4.Very handy and comfortable.5.Design js good and compact.6.Touch is also good.So far i could see only one think and honestly saying i am not happy about that. It is all about heating issue.Device heats from the left top side mostly. I wanted to give all five stars yo this device but giving three only becuase device heats.Vikas	3
25473	Pros: Android one. Pure stock android. No bloatware sh!t. More than awesome camera for this price. As soon as you switch to the low light camera..you get full control of focus and can drag lighting focus to your desired intensity. Loudspeaker is really loud and crisp. Camera bump can be ignored if you use a case or dont have a habit if keeping phone on table.Cons: Should have included Quick charger.People who say battery life is rubbish should understand for 15k thats the best you can get also if you run it on 4G dual standby the battery drain will be more as our indian service providers have a ton of lag in thier data ping.Ps: for amazon prime i got 1 year free screen replacement insurance.	5
25474	Front camera sucks. The only good thing about this phone is its display.	2
25475	Don't give us fast charger	3
25476	Good product picture quality superb...	4
25477	Satisfied in all most all the aspects ...	5
25478	All features are up to the mark	5
25479	Mobile hanging , screen not working more time	1
25480	Though I like it's stock android factor, not really satisfied with few features that it lacks like, no option to change font style, camera quality isn't thT good compared with other phones in general. Also no option of changing themes.Otherwise I like it for its productivity.	4
25481	Display quality is amazing(TRUE HD) as compared to previous models, both battery and sound quality is up to the mark ,BUT BUT BUTthe touch of this phone is too much sensitive , without even tapping the screen sometimes it respond, its frustrating sometimes to type a msg on this phone,	3
25482	Pitcher quality good & battery quality very well so very well priced	5
25483	Don't buy this phone, go for any phone in this budget Motorola and Nokia but never mi A2 (worst product)	1
25484	The camera is good and the performance is excellent and does not lag even a bit. I bought it for 15k, so a good deal at that price. But the main cons of the phone is poor battery life, it hardly runs half a day and the other is the camera bump, if not handled carefully and properly it may get scratches and damage the picture quality.	4
25485	I have expected more with this but overall i m happy with it	5
25486	Best picture quality, sound quality and best battery life.	5
25487	Best phone at this orange,its been almost 6 months still no hanging nd any other defects.	4

25507	Phone is overall good but there are some major cons.1. No native video calling which is a basic feature.2. Loud speaker is below average, cant hear in noisy area.3. Both camera are average. Not worth in 15k. No EIS, no 4K recording.4. Vibration is very weak.5. Ram management is also not so good in this phone.	3
25508	The sound optimisation is not good.	5
25509	Awesome..... Love everything about it..mmm	5
25510	Though I'm in process of getting accustom to it's large screen with single hand control. Not only is this phone fabulous and stylish but also it is fast and reactive. Loving it. :)	4
25511	If you have not enough money to buy a Galaxy S8, then this phone is for you (in terms of design & attractive display)Built quality is excellent. 10/10Processor is good (snapdragon435) bcoz if u r comparing it with VIVO ,oppo, lenovo phones then they are using mediatek 6737 processor which is wrost.Previouly i am using Asus Zenfone Laser and Lenovo K6 note. I have been using asus phone since last 2 year which is a snapdragon 616 processor phone and the performance is excellent.So snapdragon >> mediatek (oppo vivo, lenovo, gionee etc)If u want a value for money phone then always choose XIAOMI MI phones.  They r always better than other Chinese brand.Heating issue : a little bit ( my Lenovo K6 note is a heater and LG Q6 is nothing infront of Lenovo)Sound : above averageCall clarity : not tested yetCamera : good (rear)  average (front)But there r some customization options which u can modify photos . So don't worry about camera.Battery is good : 9/10 (look at screenshots)Display : 10/10UI :8/10Design : 10/10Camera: 6/10 (some software update may improve camera clarity)sound: 7/10The main demerit is lack of fingerprint scanner.Face unlock is a bit slow.Finally go for the mobile if u want a premium phone in 15k. And LG brand bcoz it's after sale service is excellent as compared to chinese brand phones.	5

25547	This Amazon great Indian festival I took the opportunity to swap my Mi A1 with a Mi A2, and I am not too disappointed. While battery seemed to last more on the Mi A1, Mi A2 is far more superior as an overall package. Here is a breakdown of what I liked and what I didn't like.What I like1. The lack of notch and nearly symmetric screen - I don't like notch and that's the main reason why I didn't go for Poco F12. Android One System - While I don't hate Miui, I fell that Android one has a cleaner feel to it3. Sleek slim design (despite the obnoxious camera bump - which more or less disappears when you put on the included cover)4. SDM660 AIE Processor which is a major improvement over SDM625 - powers through most of the normal stuff you throw at it.5. Almost unbeatable price to performance ratio for a product made in India.6. Awesome camera - I can stress this enough, but the low light performance and the bokeh effect is really good, and I say this coming from an iPhone 7 (You can check the sample shots taken on Mi A2). The sensor speed is way better than Mi A1 and can capture a good amount of details.  Even the front-facing camera performs well in low light.7. Great LTE and Wifi performance - Streaming videos on youtube were stutter-free and smooth thanks to the updated modems. This is in comparison to Mi A1 and not in comparison to any other devices.8. Good audio quality, but the DAC is not really the best.What I don't like1. Battery, I get 8 hours max of my normal use and 10 hours of judicious use (no gaming and not much youtube). A 10000 mAh battery pack is highly recommended if you are a gamer and want to get through the day.2. Lack of expandable storage - I am already at ~40G usage and that's without my essential movies - if there is a 128G version, better go for that3. Some of the apps crashes, not sure if this is an app issue or a phone issue.4. No fullscreen gestures, but that's not a deal breaker.5. no 3.5 mm jack, this is downright a crime IMO, they should have kept the headphone jack, even if it meant the phone would have been a bit thicker.	4

25561	HiI have brought this phone on THE GREAT INDIAN SALES Oct 11. Order got delivered on 15th October..This is the honest review after one month of usage.I know lot of people are too lazy to read such a long para review and thus for those People I give a three line review..This phone is definitely a best phone only to got it for a price of 10k. Don't go for the 4GB ram varient which is 13k, instead go for redmi note 6 pro which is about 14k to 15k..And the Detailed Review is as follows as*Design*:Design is simply superb.. Phone is cute and this black color is even Sexy*MIUI*:  I am stock android lover and am new to this miui.. At 1st i struggled, later i loved this UI. XIAOMI promised me MIUI 10 but i haven't received yet..*Battery* : Battery ahh nothing to say am astonished this is the 1st time i am charging once a day.. Thnx to the huge 4000mah battery..Charging time : 2 hrs 10 min from 15% to 100%And it last minimum 1 day and maximum 1.5 days ( even 2days depends upon usage)But the charger wire is short, needs special place and arrangements for charging..*Camera* : This is a place where I get disappointed.. Yes camera is average.. Rear camera has good hardware but the portrait shots are below average.. Front camera uses software to create portraits and it is more better than the rear camera.. The camera is the only place where this phone fails to meet expectations..May be XIAOMI can fix it by a update..*Performance* :Yeah XIAOMI uses SD 625 here little disappointed but ok for this price segment.. Using for a month i didn't face any lag, heating issue etc..*Security* :This phone has face unlock and it works well even in slight dark atmosphere and the finger print sensor is Lightning Fast...*Conclusion* :This phone comes with all sensors and IR BLASTER is rocking.. I control everything with this phone... MIUI gives more custom options..I exchanged old phone and got this phone.. I got lot of offers for this phone.Thus 11k phone i got for ₹5000 appoxAlso I got free screen replacement for one yearBut for othersU can get it for 10k using any bank offer..It's worth every penny even for 10k..But i wont suggest the 4Gb varient which is sold for 13k.. Instead u can go for other optionsThank you ❤	4
25562	Let's get the main point of this review out that is:-Should I buy this phone yes or no:- NO except one condition mentioned in the end.Let's start with the price:-13,999, at that price a phone has to have a set of minimum requirements that are:-1.fngerprint reader-which is not there.2.Good camera- A 10,000 phone will have a better camera.3.Battery to get you through the day- Average at best.4.micro SD card:- only thing that is there and done well.So it is clear that this phone has nothing going for it I would say add 1000 and get milk a1 or save 3000 and get a minute phone or any of Moto phones which have exceptional battery and camera and a stock Android experience.Let's take a minute to talk about the face recognition- I will tell you that 7/10 times it won't work so if trust your luck then it will work wonders for ypu.The only reason to buy this phone :-The full view display okay we can all agree that the display is absolutely gorgeous no doubts so if the only reason you are buying this phone is watch movies or consume content , with a really good headphone output and that amazing 18:9 display and a dedicated micro SD card slot(not hybrid) you won't be disappointed.But to that the battery life will not support your desire to look at it all day.I sold mine within 2 monthsAnd the front camera is alright and the speakers are alrightThank you.	2

25567	Super camera quality good mobile	5
25568	Cheap phone	3
25569	It has to be switch off and switch on every-time I have to switch between different sim. I had really high hope from this phone considering other-flagships making such great features. I wish I could return this.	2

25573	Its the best phone that i am using. I had used various brand phones but for me its the best.	5
25574	All is well👌👌👌👌👌	5
25575	Camera is awesome..battery life is not good	5
25576	I have done big mistake.. mi A2 is only perfect in camera. It's battery discharged so early. And brightness is not good if you compare with redmi note 4. Mi A2 don't have mi security and app lock application.. while redmi note 4 have these apps.	2
25577	A2 is first one from MI  family that I have purchased. And I must say they have given me a reason not to go for other brands.Finger sensor are smoothly working.Only thing I noticed is it's audio jack which is a C type. Need to carry it's connector everywhere.Rest all r up to mark.	4
25578	Not bad.... impressive display and night mode	4
25579	V nizz product fm Moto ...satisfied with the priz 14 thous	5
25580	10k is perfect price ,People who bought for 15 k should regret.  In 10 k is perfect phone .screen quality is awsome ,handling is easy.we can use double sim and memory card also which is lacking in redmi note 5. Camera quality is good.bttry prblm is not a big issu do not use knock on  optn .Update software  performance will improves ,heating  and btry backup will also improve.	4
25581	One look is enough	5
25582	Battery and camera are not as expected	5
25583	Good product on this range	4
25584	Everything much batter ..but hanging problems issues	2
25585	I have been a fan of honour, used 8 lite, 8 Pro now 8x.quickcharging,trouble free os, optimizer kirin processor for their phones, 4gb ram, 64 GB with gpu optimizer for performance, 4g dual use with volte(both you can use volte), extra memory slot, clear daylight shots(might time shots are hit or miss), long battery, latest android updates, affordable price.... What not to like. Well done honour. Mi (redmi), honour are becoming heavyweights in mobile markets. Good for 2 Years use(5g is coming.. Ya)	5
25586	Camera Quality is damn good 10 on 10 but battery life is average.	5
25587	Great product love it	5
25588	there is no memory card dedicated slot and battery is draining very fast	4
25589	I bought this phone in September and using for 3 months. I would like to tell the screen of the phone is awesome no doubt about that and also performance is quite good but camera is very bad, you can’t take moving object pictures with it. Also no screen mirroring.Gaming is fine , Battey life is good and overall nice. But if you buying for camera i won’t recommend this phone.	4
25590	Awesome product but battery life is not good.	5
25591	I switched to this from old galaxy j7 1.5gb phone. Phone is a bit slow compare to redmi note 5 pro. Battery is good enough and easily lasts more than a full working day. Camera is good. Screen quality is at its best as it is an smoaled phone. Colours really pop up and far better than other ips lcd full hd screen phones. Multi tasking is a shame because at a time you cant open more than 4 or 5 apps. Overall a value phone as I got it at Rs.11500 including old phone exchange of Rs.5150. Definitely a worth buy at Rs.11500 but if one can spend Rs.17990 which is its original price then he may go for honor play or poco f1.Thanks for reading..After October 2018, they have added autobrightness button. Also dual 4G standby support is added. Nice to see these features now...	4
25592	Sound quality and volume both are very bad. Battery life is pathetic and charging time is very long. I literally have to carry power bank all the time.	1
25593	I love this product very good battery life... Fast charging, amazing clicks with with with selfi and rear camera	5
25594	Battery is good approximate 2days with normal use	4
25595	Lower price and quality best	1
25596	I bought honor 8x , its amazing mobile,  battery pickup is also very good& fast charging.  Option is given in this mobile its best features & camera also cool.	5
25597	All in all. It's worth purchasable smartphone	5
25598	Nice but I am by in price 11,000 waste my 💰 money Rs.1000	4
25599	Very good brand	4

25626	Average phone from mi	3
25627	Basically I'm oneplus3t phone user from past 2 years and so this honor 8x actually is downgrade for me :). Yes, i just used this phone for 4 days and sold in olx for 12500/-.got it for 14034/- post cash back .  Overall the phone is excellent. but the photographer in me who got used to capture stunning pics in oneplus 3t, its not all satisfactory.  the portrait mode is worst.  although the display is good, there is slight lag when you are switching between apps. For people who used low end phones with slow processors, this honor 8x will feel great.If your budget is 14000/- . there is only one phone in this segment which you should go for. Mi A2 .Mi A2 captures wonderful pictures.Pros:Not listing as you will only see pros everywhere abt this phone. go on to Cons section.Cons:Camera is big let down. there are many options in camera,but picture quality is not good.Speaker sound is not loudThere is slight lag when switching between appsWifi connectivity has issues when switching between 4G/WiFi	2
25628	Good Android one phone, Picture quality is very good and sound quality is also good ,fast processor but little disappointed with battery, Amazon exchange and cash back offers are very good for customer.	5
25629	Over all the phone Was good at this price Camera was also good as mentioned in the description the only drawback is While calling it's suddenly Press mute and switch on flash light and with out knowing to Us the sensor was very poor that too the call sensor very bad apart from this no issues with the phone	4
25630	Good quality products	4
25631	Extremely poor product from Samsung..Best part is that their Custcare doesn't respond..One Gaurav of that Custcare, literally made me feel as I if i made a mistake by buying a Samsung product..I swear, I m not gonna buy any Samsung product in future..Samsung with the support of likes of Gaurav show us that we are choiceless..Pathetic, disgusting & unpardonable product & service from Samsung..	1
25632	Awesome phone at this price.	5
25633	In many review talking about camera but camera was good nothing any problem	5
25634	Very niy	1
25635	Overall semma!! Vera level!! Worth for this cost! 6.5 screen it's superb!!	5

25637	gud features...affrodable rate...	5
25638	Awesome product...fast delivery from amazon in just 4 days	4
25639	Good n nice product	4
25640	Android one rockss	5
25641	Heavy weight, its not slim, performance good, sound is not good, the unvanted Adds are irritating.	2
25642	Its look and feel is very premium, Android one's stock Android adds to its premium feel when you operate it. Some easyness that was made available in MIUI is definitely missing. Battery is good for a day but bit disappointing if you compare with other similar phones. I am very happy with my decision to buy MI A2.	5
25643	Everything is nice but touch screen could have been made better	4
25644	Picture quality is awesome but the sound quality should be better the speakers are very slow nd battery life is average	5
25645	I'm using this phone from last 5 months, this is my experience with this phone.Pro's:SleekEye catching designNot having hybrid sim trayFull view display is amazingly goodCons:Very worst battery backup, have to charge min twice in a day.If battery goes below 10%then you can't predict when it goes completely off.It does lag, with 3Gb RAM.Captured images are of low quality.Facial recognition works, but it just takes 2,3 tries. There you feel lack of finger print sensor.Poor quality earphones.Sleek design is villain for this phone, back cover is very much smooth and sure it does slip away from hands few times in a day.Back cover is not scratch resistant. (Got 2-3 scratches in 4 days of usage) Bcs of slipping and scratches you're forced to have back cover which may make your phone look as ordinary non full view display phone.Don't buy this phone if you're a heavy user and cannot access charging whole day (can have power bank though). This phone is for those people who are moderate to less users and accessible to charging whole day.	2
25646	Very good decent phone in this budget.. Excellent features in this mid range.. Fast face lock...	5
25647	Does not showing face unlock	5
25648	It does what it says.. happy with this phone	5
25649	Not happy with camera 😭😭😭😭	4
25650	On time delivered but not classy look.	4
25651	Amazing phone. Beats any other in price features and looks.	5
25652	Good qalite	4
25653	Only buy this mobile if you like the display more than anything else.Yes, this phone has 5.5inch screen with a physical size less than the available phones with 5inch screen.But, rest are mediocre.1. IT IS NOT  QUALCOM 435 PROCESSOR, it is 430.2. The software is heavily customerised and most of the cases it is pathetic. E.g. camera UI.System memory is 9.2GB for this phone for 7.1.1 nougat where as with same version of android nokia 5 comsumes just 7.2GB and moto g5s 7.4gb.3. Camera quality is pathetic. So as the camera app. Such blunt software with this pricy phone is not accepted. No manual control. No means none, not even WB, ISO etc.In short it is not the younger version of G6	3
25654	Best mobile in LG Q6Good price and good performance , battery back up and camera quality	5

25661	Phone not worth for the price .Display is awesome but phone gets heated too quickly when using camera or what's app.Not capable of handling high level games and the camera both front and rear is average.Battey drains fast and headphones are waste . Better buy other phones ,waste of money .Face unlock doesn't work properly in low light .This phone is worth only for people who like to showoff .	2
25662	Don't buy, battery is hopeless, you can't enjoy Evan half day, if you using social media sites than consider battery life for four hours	1
25663	Stunning look and design. 5 star for design and looks. But it has heating problem. Lg should work onto heating issue. Side metal strip gets heat quikly. Dont know why its happen! Camera is not upto the mark. Don't focus things easily. Under 15 k we can get good camera phone. Im also using lenovo mobile under 13k, but its camera is better then lg Q6. 2 star only for look and UI function .	2
25664	One most fine	3
25665	Pic qulty is not soo good ,battery and sound is fine	5
25666	Awesome cell phone	5
25667	More features are possible to add but not added	2
25668	Camera quality is good.Great processor with stock android give lag free experience.Battery life is fine for normal users but users who want to play games may face hard time.Deficient of 3.5mm jack can make you pass from tough time if you don't have adaptor.Sound is loud but quality isn't good.	3

25672	"Redmi 6 Pro is a very nice android device. With 4000 mAH lasts for two days as is claimed and is recharged fast with its charger . It has its own system of checking security including payment securities. Display of 5.84"" is good enough. Display resolution of 2280 x 1080 is nice. However, the width should have been more broad for ease of viewing, writing and navigating. It has its good number of useful apps pre-installed that average users may not have to install third party apps like photo editing, notes, cloud storage, scanner, cleaner, compass, torch, etc. Cleaning app regularly checks and suggests cleaning of junk files, memory. Fingerprint lock and AI system is added security. System and security updates are available at regular intervals. The body is strong and solid. With dual rear camera the picture quality is very good even in low light conditions. Networking is good enough depending on the strength of available network providers. Sound quality is nice. The file manager is not convenient. The message management system is also cumbersome. Safety locking from accidental deletion of important messages is lacking. On the whole a nice buy."	5
25673	Nice phone overallIn budget mobiles	4
25674	Good phone from honor nice face unlock good sound best is the Notch screen truly awesome... Great built quality but no fast charging no 4k recording colours are oversaturated in camera mi note 5 pro have better camera. the camera quality is poor compare with Samsung s7which is 2016 model and honor 8x is 2018 .  I brought is for myself but am giving this phone to my mom coz phone is not for me buy this phone only if you like notch screen in budget phone	2

25692	Guys let me give you honest reviews about this phone based on my personal experience.I am using this phone since last 7 working daysI know there are a lot of mixed reviews about this phone here & so I also know it makes us confused if we are about to buy this phone.So do not worry & go for it because as per me this is the best looking+performance phone in this 15k budget from a branded company like LG.Enjoy !!	5
25693	Bad battery	3
25694	Superb phone I liked it awesome display touch no heating problem full waitless and good handy I can prefer	5
25695	unsatisfactory product, face recognition and unlocking of home/lock screen does not work at trusted places, software buggy. 18:9 vision is gimmick not of much use, Speaker volume very low, battery low capacity and handset gets warm, lastly does not last even  full day with moderate use.The product is much inferior to redmi note 4, bought only as I do not touch chinese phones. the correct price of this set should be below 9K	3
25696	Average camera, average sound quality. But good processor for the price & decent overall performance. Worth the money you spend.	4
25697	Good phone built with good working perfomace.Camera performance is not up to the mark. I mean, it is not as op6 or iphone. Low light photographs require major attention for developers.Light sensors is very poor. Adaptive brighness is not at all working as it should.However, sound quality and battery performance is fine.Camera is usp of this phone and require major focus. I feel its a software issue.	4
25698	Very good product performance is awesome	5
25699	Picture quality very accurate	5
25700	Very good quality of the mobile ..fast charging comparing other in this segment. Camera quality is ok. Look and build up is great. But no back cover and tempered glass as like oppo f7 ..other wise it's nice to have a great cell in this price.	5
25701	Best mobile in this range ..	5
25702	Loved the product, just go for it	5
25703	Phone with Amazing look and feel. Its pretty light in weight just the way i wanted. Performance, Camera, battery life are all decent. Have been using this phone for around 3 months now.	4
25704	Please dont Buy this device, battery is bad and hanging and heating problem, camera is also bad	2
25705	The phone works fine even with snapdragon 435. Not much satisfied with the battery backup. Lag-free gaming experience. Sound quality is okay. Rear camera is good. Not satisfied with the front camera. Build quality is awesome with premium look. Pretty impressed with 5 home touch buttons feature. Always have to reset the face id if you remove and reset the pin lock.Pros:Awesome screen qualityOne-hand compatibilityPremium lookGood rear cameraProcessor works fineSmooth Multi-taskingMonthly Android Security Patch updatesCons:Front cameraExtreme heating issues (top left part of the phone)No Knock-Code	4
25706	Totally disappointed.. when I brought ..on Amazon in feature.. showing that time dual 4g standby. But now they are modified.. one sim 4g support at a time.. please read the details	3
25707	Awesome look and good working but need to improve camera clarity. Dont expect too much about camera....	3
25708	Boss.. the batter is a killer.. it will reduce like a video game score as u watch it and not sure.. if the screen is meant like that.. everything is blurred.. Looks quality phone though	2
25709	Awesome stylish.	5
25710	Good product .Worth the money.CON:Definitely needs a phone Case, as phone body is very smooth and slippery.	5
25711	Awesome features in budget phone bt front flash would reqired	5
25712	overall  performance is good. battery should be above 4000 mah.	5
25713	Picture quality is awesome.	5
25714	Didn't expected this product to be so down level.I am not rating amazon service here.Amazon is and will be best for its service.but I am still a big fan of LG smartphone but this LG Q6 comes more with the software problem.better to go got honour 9i	3
25715	Compared with Note 5 Pro, this phone has a bit smaller size and thereby, feels more comfortable in hand.	5
25716	Returned nokia 5.1plus and then orderd this this one is much better than nokia	5
25717	Size of the Smartphone is handy and a good smartphone overall.	4
25718	Not happy about this phone.	4
25719	Very Good product but battery backup is little poor	5
25720	For an average user like me who is not interested in big displays or heavy gaming, this one is okay. It sits comfortably in hand but had the mobile a bit lighter it would've been awesome..the fact that only either of the SIM slot support 4g is also a bit disappointing...camera does its work nicely and the battery backup too is good😊	3
25721	Its amazing phone is very smooth and stock Android is awesome. The only issue right now is the official face unlock is not present in this phone, and the bettery life it's ok for normal users but not ok for advanced users like me.	5
25722	Cheap n best.....	4
25723	Awesome in lookGood cameraAvg batteryI brought it for my father and he is fully satisfied with it	4
25724	Premium look n fell. very handy. Clean UI. Good phone for this price. Happy about the product.	5
25725	Phone is good. Display is the USP. Camera is also good. But in this value there are much more options available if some one not required 18:9 ratio screen.	3
25726	The phone is avg..You can get a better one in this range..Check Honour..Don't waste money on Mi 6 Pro..Camera is also avg or below avg...Only notch is the point of attraction otherwise phone is similar as their old one......don't waste ur money in buying this phone..	3
25727	This is a good product	5
25728	Why buy this old chip 630 snapdragon.Snapdragon 636 is much faster.	3
25729	Amazon Good Customer Care support and nice and cool mobile	5
25730	Not a valu for Money !!!!😥😥😥😥😥	4
25731	I bought it 2 Months back. Really a nice phone with good camera and nice stock Android experience. Love u Mi A2 :)	5
25732	I'm ok	4
25733	NICE product	5
25734	budget phones	5
25735	The phone is perfect for daily use. It is supporting smoothly to run multiple applications in-parallel. Bye the way, I am not playing games in the mobile. It is having great battery back-up, but the battery is a in-built one.	5
25736	Picture and sound quality is good	4
25737	If u r a moderate user I will surely recommend this phone. Simply awesome. Battery backup is extraordinary. 2 days battery standby for a normal user. Camera is  best at this price segment. Though glass back seems to add beauty to the phone,it is a fingerprint magnet. Suggested to be used with cases.ram management is good. No issues with the os. Best deal at 15k	5
25738	everthing is good	5
25739	It hangs sometimes when i use bluetooth or something else don't know why...Battery life is good but in 17000 i could gdt better.Camera quality is awesome	3
25740	Don't buy this crap	3
25741	I was waiting for the release of this phone in India. Personally after using this phone for more than one week, there is no short of excitement. There are few other phone in the market with slight specification varience but this is excellent. Something I found amazing are1. Look and feel like flagship phones.2. I love the notch3. Selfies are excellent4. Smooth functioning5. Sound clarity on callSomething could have done better1. Earphones2. Processor- There is no problem with it but it is exactly the same what we get for 12k or 13k phones with honour brand.3. Could added a back cover in box because the glass touch is slippery it takes time to find a good one in the market.	5
25742	1) Battery draining fastly compare to other mobile same 3000mbh battery mobile,2) Display poor visibility in sunlight condition3) 3.5 Audio Jack not available4) No External Memory card5) Price to high.Not worth for this mobile Rs.14999	1
25743	Awesome phone good clarity full display view	5
25744	Full vision display is great.	5
25745	Its nice phone and look is very pretty	5

25751	I mentioned the picture above.. Very gud quality camera.. Portrait mode very gud all over gud budget phone..	4
25752	MI A2 capture perfect picture& portrait mode Its really awesome,camera and sound  is also soo good	5
25753	If your are more towards stylish mobile then go for this mobile. It's display is awesome. One of the major drawback is back plastic panel , ofcourse it can be covered using cases .  Camera wise and performance wise it is above average product.	4
25754	The phone is not worthy. The hardware features are only for showcase. Phone gets hanging. Mostly the file manager is not working properly. You can not slide the photos in the file manager.	3
25755	All features that I expected are available for best price like performance, picture quality etc	5
25756	Overall it's a good smart phone	3
25757	Don't buy this mobile,if you want heater go wiht this. Camera quality is as like China made.LG and Amazon support also very bad.They were refusing to return device. Heating temperature is more than42 degree.I am rating 5 star to read everyone.	5
25758	Camera quality is too good.. but battery life is not good...  And sometimes phone is getting hanging or vibrating without any reason	3
25759	Battery is poor.....Camera is very good	5

25778	Great phone for the price nice design looks premium	5
25779	betari life is so schov	5
25780	The phone design is brilliant. It looks like a top-tier flagship phone. Stock Android is always a plus. The camera takes pretty decent pictures in lowlight. The HDR is a bit off. Sometimes it makes your photos look good. Sometimes it doesn't. So far, the phone works really fast. No lags whatsoever.You'd think the lack of a headphone jack would be off putting. It really isn't. After a while you just get used to using the convertor.The only downside to the phone is it's battery life. It drains in about 4-5 hours of continuous usage.At this price, you get all the features of your flagship phones with decent hardware specs. Add in a good battery life and this phone would have killed every other phone in the market at this price range.	4
25781	Been just 10 days i bought moto g6 and already phone hangs, gets stuck, slow it is ... and i still haven’t loaded the phone up with songs and games and videos..not what i expected from a moto device. Disappointed . May be it is bcoz moto opted fo sd 450 and not sd625 or 636...not that i am comparing it wit iphone or one plus,  dis fone is slower compared to other phones in the same price bracket.	1

25836	Mobile looks great. But performance, battery backup not good👎..	3
25837	I became a honor fan after using its very popular honor 6x, it's still a rocking gadget and I gave it to my wife, since she was in need of a new one.Honor 8x will not disappoint anyone and it perform like a superman in the sub 15k category. It's outperform redmi note 5 pro in every department. Huawei 's low cost technological advancements will make them India' s market leader very soon.	5
25838	Very nice osm phone	5
25839	This is my first LG smartphone and I love this. What impressed me apart from regular features are small and minor software features which is very useful in our day to day life. Its actually and intelligent kind of phone software wise. Camera is good but not excellent. Sound is good but not excellent. Its not a powerful processor so performance is just average.	4
25840	Battery very bad ,no call recording,dual app not working,	4
25841	I am using this set no heating problem and smoothly key and cemara best	5
25842	Overall goodheating issue is there but every smart has simillar problem so we can ignore it.Performance and look wise it's awesome.	4
25843	No too good. I think that phn should be under 9k without any offer or discount like realme 2Good1. Battery life good2. Back camera awesome3. Notch & too handyBad.1. Less thik2. Sound not louder comparison redmi 4 & 5 which I'm using3. High price	4
25844	Battery back is worst	1
25845	Battery drains in 3 hours....do not buy	1
25846	First of all.. its realy stunnig, premium and uniq glass desgn, its realy cool , did nt feel like holding a 6.5 inch phone, almost ful disply on front, disply qualty is very good ,the new kirin 710 giving lag free performnce,Picture quality is very good , sound qualty is abve avrage , but using a good headphne give u more better experince, battery life is unbelvble ,for a 6.5 inch phne evn in heavy use it will last for 1 day, honor is optmised batry brilliantly, overal its very good upgrade for me from honor 6x , some cool featrs also added on new emui version , more than value for money	5
25847	Best phone in the mid range category... True value for money... Battery, camera, picture quality, interface, display, user friendly,... The best part is the design... It looks premium and awesome in ur hands... I am very happy with this phone	5
25848	Mind blowing..smartphone from lg...just go for it...blindly	5
25849	Battery back up is good	5
25850	it should be fingerprint sensor, but build quality is very good i love it	4
25851	Battery life is not  good , but if your purpose is photography then go for it	5
25852	Lg always rocks , everything is good and the camera exceeded the expectation, but the battery could have been better	5
25853	After going through all reviews and videos, i decided to buy Honor 8X finally! And this moment, I am writing a review here and i am extremely happy with my decision. So, here we go with the real review:1. Amazing display, details are good and crystal clear2. New unique UI feel (EMUI 8.2)3. One word for design, beauty. Slim n sexy (black i took) with glassback.4. AI camera is too good, auto adjust the color and focus along with depth sensers even in low light.5. Battery is undoubtedly long lasting, thanks to huawei for 3500+ mah battery 😃6. Sound is better, not the best honestly but not low as well, i can say I compared with iPhone 7 and easily did beat it.7. Better Ram management, fast processing by Kirin 710 huawei processor and GPU turbo for gaming.8. Type C fast charging is missing but that's not a big deal coz you need to carry type C cable always! Very less people use Type C.9. 4K VIDEO recording and OIS are missed but that's for motion videos, else totally fine.10. Under 15k,it's giving you more than what it could have given! Especially with huawei mfd. Brand name, its a prefect phone.Don't get confuse, go and buy!	5
25854	Front camera at night is not good	5
25855	Thank you Amazon for the quick two day delivery.I got the A2 in exchange for the MI Note5 which I had bought in April but was not happy with its picture quality. A2 has taken care of my photography needs.Sound wise it's louder than MI Note5 but more treble than bass.The A2 feels lighter and Android One makes things easier to access compared to Note5.This phone would be used for calls and photography only so I am satisfied for now 😀	5
25856	Super phone..Strongly recommend..	5
25857	Looking nice&slim, back camera clarity is good and phone weight is also less.	4
25858	With in 15 days Lins on display people who are looking for this don't buy this phone quality is very poor from mi	1
25859	I have purchased this phone last week ,here is the review of this phone1.vedio quality is very good2.battery backup is not good3.camera quality is not good of this price4.phone too much heat while using .5.while using the phone some times  automatically stopped after that we have to re start the phone .	2
25860	It's color is not properly red as here designed. So I am not satisfied.Battery life is too poor. Picture quality is moderate, not as expected.Very handy and rapidly charged.	3
25861	Never buy stock Android it is of no good.It's been 2-3 months phone has started slowing down	1
25862	Very happy with the overall package that q6 offers in this price range.	5
25863	Like good performance	4
25864	Phone is good but should have added a better battery of around 4000mAh. Other than that camera quality is good but it goes bad when it comes to click a moving picture.	4
25865	Beware Amazon and Buyers!! Screen size of Q6 is 5.15 inch NOT 5.5 as claimed. Otherwise beautifull & goodlooking phone. Some Apps somtimes take time to load.	4
25866	Nice phone.....	5
25867	I will start review with most amazing part of this phone - Display!Display occupies maximum of front and has 18:9 aspect ratio. It increases usability by good amount as actual device is very small compared to display size and phone is very easy to hold and operate by single hand.Display by qualitywise is very sharp and produces vivid colors. Sunlight readability is better than AMOLED phones at this price.Camera- Camera is average for the price range. Rear camera is very good in daylight but suffers in low or artificial light. Front camera is ok ok and gets work done in sufficient light.Sound- Output is very shallow from speakers but equally good from audio jack. I found it better than Oneplus 3T. Maybe audio processor is really good but its the speaker which spoils the show.Processing - They have used low range snapdragon processor so don't expect any miracle. But despiteb this and LGs heavy customizations, phone doesn't feel laggy. Day to day operations are smooth. I have not played any heavy games on Q6 so won't comment on that.Connectivity - 4G VoLTE works flawlessly, dual SIM operations are smooth and call clarity is very good, as expected from LG phone.Value for money? Well certainly not at 15k but its a deal if you get same for anything less than 13k. Amazon has deals running on for Q6 and exchange offers are also irresistible. I exchanged my old and idle Nexus 5 against Q6 for 4.5K.	4
25868	Best in class performance. if you wish to buy clean and pure android experience this is the thing.	5
25869	The best thing about this phone is it is sooper compact containing 5.8 inch screen, and is light weight.Performance is great for a moderate user like me. No lag, no heating and fast finger print.Amazing battery backup.Average camera.Notch is something i didn't like because it is not allocated for notifications wisely. May be next software update will fix it.	5
25870	Money value and nice.. performance	5
25871	All good features foe the price	5
25872	Want more improvements in camera section, Day time rear pictures better, but particularly in lights( in evening and night)  time picture quality very poor. And one more thing apps not smooth performance, light struck.	3
25873	1no	5
25874	This price range its is owsm	5
25875	Overall it's a good product at this price	5
25876	Best Product I ever purchased on Amazon	5

25879	I Like It Mi	5
25880	Good product !!	5
25881	Size of this phone is awsome. Very good in hand. But sometimes doing small tasks takes ages to complete.	3
25882	Not good phone.Because storage capacity only 22 gb.And battery capacity low.Some setting and futures noe good .	5
25883	Mobile is ok but battery is draing very fast when using data and playing gamesDisplay is 10/10Battery is 5/10Performance is 7/10Camera is 6/10Built quality is 8/10Note:  1) if you are heavy user don't go for it, because when you are heavy user charge the mobile at least 3 times in a day.2) When you are normal user go for it, this mobile suits for normal user only.	1
25884	Good phone.. worth every penny	5
25885	The fone is a value for money..Pro1. Good build quality.2. Display output is good3. Smooth operating system4. Camera quality is reasonably good for the price bracket.5. Day light photos are very impressiveCon1. Camera suffers in low light condition.2. Charging port Micro USB is a bit dated should have been type C.Frankly worth buy....	5
25886	Ultimate Phone and Amazon services	5
25887	Worst ever, lags after one month. Battery bavkup is aweful. The Gorilla glass breaks even for a minor fall fown the floor. Dont buy this phone. I had worst experience	1
25888	No one can beat	5
25889	Battery is poor than A1 , it hangs daily. I have to restart again	3
25890	I am using this handset as a primary handset and bought this handset on recomendation of friends who are using redmi note 5 pro.I have found so many software glitches in this device .Seems like Mi has bought the Android one program by doing so many negotiations and reducing the feature .Some glitches are as below-1. This phone is unable to adjust brightness in direct sunlight.2. The touch of the phone works even after making calls.  Some time cancel the call.3. Display is not crisp.4. There is no dedicated photo viewer in this using the google photos as a app.5. Phone supports fast charging but they are providing standard charger.6.heats too much .6. Type c to 3.5mm jack sound output is horrible .7. This phone goes automatically to do not disturb mode/silent mode.This phone is like half cooked chicken neigher you can through it neighter you can keep it.Not happy with the product or i am expecting so much from them.	2
25891	I buy it for effective price of 12500 and everything is jzt amazing about this phone...works smoothly..camera is really awsm	5
25892	Worest mobile	1
25893	Really good phone. Value for money.	5
25894	Today i am Doing a pros and cons review of this LG Q6Let's start -Pros of LG Q6Dual SIM Slot with Dedicated micro SD Slot.Crystal clear 5.5 1080p full HD + Full Vision Display.The frame is Made of 7000-grade Aluminium.Face recognition/ KnockCode for Unlocking the phone.OTG Cable is supported.NFC is supported by the device.Built on Military standard 810G certification.Cons of LG Q6:-The under-powered processor for multitasking or heavy Gaming.No Type-C USB Slot.The battery is non-removable.The Camera especially Secondary is not up to the mark.Speaker located at the back with mediocre sound.It is disappointing to see the mid-range phone without fingerprint scanner.So I hope You liked this review and it helped youIf it helped you then help me too By Hitting The helpful button belowThanks for reading ! have a good day !	4
25895	Camera puar	2
25896	Awesome Service & Product	5
25897	Battery life good..	4
25898	Phone is very compact.Front camera is not great. Battery life is average or so. But the main con is the heating. The metal rim on the left side, on the side of volume buttons, gets heated up quite a bit when on internet.The worst I have noticed when I was using twitter and installing apps from play store. If internet is not enabled then its still workable.	3
25899	What a phone just Awesome phone friends 😍😍😍	5
25900	Not the fastest phone for the price. It lags playing heavy games	4
25901	Overall good productI liked it.I am giving 4* because the package doesnt have earphone(Huawie doesnt give with phone)I still wonder how people will use a phone without headset at public and not sure what is the strategy of huawie by not giving earphone.Since I have a spare earphone of same model,I accepted the phone	4
25902	Very nice and premium look and awesome phone. Aankh band karke le lo trust me guys is price range ka best phone hai.	5
25903	Review after a month use..a little bit issue of heating ,sometime hangs for few sec,slow charging,face unlock is not up to the mark otherwise good in other aspects.	4
25904	Very nice and good phone from Xeomi	5
25905	Battery lool	1

25907	i gifted to my sister. She is feeling good to use thatREAD MORE	4
25908	I was previously using Lenovo Z2 plus and it was one of the best phones in 2017 offering snapdragon 820 at just RS. 10,000. So after a year it started lagging cuz I was playing very heavy games. So then the new Mid Range phones were Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X. These were under by budget. I wanted to buy Realme 2 Pro as it had 8gb ram and good camera. But then after watching a lot of youtube videos, I thought I should go for honor 8x. And so I bought this. When I opened the package and took honor 8x on my hand, it felt premium. But then when I started downloading apps from playstore, it wasn't using my data to download it, just wifi. I had to cancel all installs and download it at my office Wifi. 2)The next thing is that, the phone is really really HEAVY. I was using it with my left hand while I was sleeping, and literally after 5 minutes my wrist started to pain. But what if it falls on my head or mouth, like all the phones do? While using it lying on the bed? I am going to get a serious injury. In the Tech pages too, they have mentioned this as a Con.3)Front Camera:  The Camera really SUCKs. The back camera is okay, but it's saturation is very high especially for Red, Green and Blue. The camera has depth, but it's of no use as the Camera Saturation is high. Don't talk about the front camera, I use my sister's Realme 1 for taking selfies...4) PUBG: So when I open the game, it has loading error, says 'Could not connect to server' seems to be network issue, but the Realme 1 loads properly without any issues, even when both the phones are in the SAME room. Also the map in Realme 1 loads faster, maybe because it has 6 GB ram and the one I am using has 4 GB. I should have gone for Realme 2 pro which had 6 Gb for lesser Price.I wished I had ordered Realme 2 pro. Too lazy to return then get refund and all. But if you need a light phone, go for Realme 2 pro. it's light, games don't lag and also has a good battery. I'm just somewhat sad.  And the Customer Service of HONOR is so pathetic, they don't know what I am asking and COPY PASTE wrong info in the chat, I once had to talk with a Supervisor to get the correct information.	1
25909	Its a very good phone....value for money.	5
25910	I brought this smartphone at 9k and it's average smartphone at this price.1- it has some heating issue when charging and multitasking.2- Display is excellent.3- back camera 📷 is worst	2

25925	Amazing yrLooks complete package	5
25926	The absence of IR blaster forbids it from using as a universal remote. Mirroring on TV screen lacks. Casting you tube on TV most often fails. Overall performance is good except slight heating while playing video.	4
25927	Picture & sounds pretty good but battery life is wrost	3
25928	Superrrrrrrr	5
25929	Honor 8x what a great quality phone having 6.5 inch crystal clear display with hd+ and fhd+ settings, The screen to body ratio is very well mentained and the finishing gives a premium reach feel to user..Sound quality is very good with huawei histen audio on headphones and on speaker very well loud enough.Battery is very good performed even it has 6.5 inch display, Huawei CPU Turbo works awesome.Performance of software and hardware is like Flagship phone., I am Redmi and samsung user previously and i can say this phone is a better performing in terms of Cpu and battery.Pub g and you tube video experience is really awesome and i like the screen body ratio because of full scren tab setting given in phone.I am very happy choosing this phone under 20k this phone is must buy and i dont thik the uniquness of this phone any other phone will provide in this android market.	5

25933	Awesome one.. As a android developer I strongly recommend to buy this coz Hardware quality for a reason	5
25934	Redmi Note 6 Pro is an amazing phone with salient features available in Middle range Smartphones. The camera quality is definitely an improvement over the previous series. Pictures quality is commendable and the phone is very handy.	5
25935	I am facing problem with this phone hang and not smooth touch	1

25945	Good phone. Pure Android.Very good camera. Also get the Android Pie on 20th Nov.Battery life is ok. Drains very little in idle condition.No lag observed in heavy games like PUBG etc.Recommended to buy if you need dual camera,  6+ inch screen, latest Android version. And your budget is around 15000.	5
25946	Great camera as well as better life and NFC not present	4
25947	Really frustrated with this mobile. It's been 6 months now and the phone getting hot all the time, the contacts and message apps were getting freeze all the time. Can't make any call in less than 10 seconds. Don't buy this device. Stay away !	1
25948	Nice phn but, battery life is too short	4
25949	Never bought wast of mony only the name of brand not any good quality .. Everything is average not better or good	1
25950	earlier i was using Moto X play. it was quite good. i have replaced my Moto X play with Latest Moto g6. After 3months usage battery life came down and Head Phones provided with mobile are not working. totally disappointed.not expected this from Moto.	1
25951	At first point display and design very good.Full hd+ at this prince range very good.Processor 2years old SD 625,ok type not very good at present.Battery life fantastic.Front camera totally disappointed,Rear camera good.Its totally for normal user,not for hvy user.Display:-4.5*/5*BATTERY:-5*/5*CAMERA FRONT:-2*/5CAMERA REAR:-3.5*/5*PERFORMANCE:-4*/5*HVY GAMING:-3.5*/5*DESIGN:-4*/5PUBG:-3*/5*N:B:-(IF U THOGHT,U WANT TO PLAY PUBG WITH THIS PHONE,SO I RQEST TO YOU,THERE ARE MANY OPTION TO PLAY PUBG PLAY TYPE PHONE.BAD EXPERINCE PUBG WITH REDMI 6PRO,MINIMUM GRAPHICS LEVEL,GRAPHICS DROP)ITS TOTALY FOR NORMAL USER AND NORMAL TYPE GAME.THEN AS YOUR WISH).	4
25952	Very nice productPicture quality is very goodAnd I used 6 months mobile works very well	5
25953	Nice product in this range once the new update comes it gone become much more smooth...in UI	4
25954	Sound make noise and front selfie camera portrait mode not working...Bad experience from Amazon...	1
25955	Received prepaid order  in 11days after non stop follow up. Most Pathetic Experience.Rest Mobile is good in this price. Camera & Speaker needs some serious improvement.	4
25956	If you are looking for a selfie phone...Don't buy it..Rest is good...	3
25957	At this price range this is the finest phone you can get	5
25958	The price tag is huge,in this range you can get notch display with better battery specs. Now xiaomi is neither special nor unique in launching new features. Realme 2 pro is better than mi A2,if you are not a fan of ir blaster,metal back,and stock android.	2
25959	Best sound quality beat every mobileGood displey positive camera	5
25960	Its all up to you how you use nd after all its a human nature never satisfied	5
25961	No problem no issues i have faced yet osm product	5
25962	Mind-blowing product	5
25963	Picture quality is very good	5
25964	Awesome budget phoneCamera goodI like the screen size and design luks luxuries	5
25965	awesome cameraREAD MORE	5
25966	Best phone in this segment	5
25967	At this price range you get the mixture of all the best features of Redmi note 5 Pro, Redmi note 5 + notch	5
25968	Overall this is a good phone.Good performanceGood build qualityGood CameraStock Android(Fast Security update and Android Update)Everyone is telling 3000mah battery is very less but according to my experience, You can easily get one day of battery life.Four negative points everyone is talking about this phone and my thought on that according to my experience.1. Battery - I easily get one day of battery life(Approx 24hr)2. No 3.5mm - Yes, this is a problem you have to carry Adapter always.3. No SD Card Slot - 64GB is more than sufficient for most of the user, and even if they give Hybrid slot then most of the user use 2-SIM.4. Price - Price is not high(17000 - Discount most of the time).You can't compare pricing with the phone which comes with MiUi because they get extra money, in that case, by showing your advertisement.	4
25969	It's a very good product by Mi. I like its sound quality. Its picture quality is nice but not excellent as samsung phones have. Overall battery gives me 1 day & 10 hrs discharge. Overall I would like to give 4 stars out of 5.The budget phone for everyone who likes to prefer best.The product quality is excellent.	4
25970	This is great product with truely value for money.. and the processor is extremly brilliant...and the camera quality is very good and very long battery life..truely one of the best phone in this range.	5
25971	Battery life is not good..	5
25972	Audio suddenly dropping and increasing	3
25973	Heating problem in this phone	4
25974	Amazing model in a unbilevable price. Really loved it.	5
25975	been using it for 3 weeks nowgreat phone recommend it.PROSdisplay,built,camera is decent,CONSno fingerprint censor,	5
25976	This is a great phone for the price the, build quality of the phone is amazing, this is a smooth running phone even though it has Snapdragon 450 processor, if you want to play pubg this is a phone for you because  , it's screen produces some vibrant colours better than the competition and all the extra price you are paying for this is for that super amoled display which no one offer in this price segment and Samsung's reliability and build quality.	5
25977	Nating	4
25978	Who ever is looking for this product they might have already know the pros and cons of this product, if you are not habitutated to fingerprint this phone is for you, camera quality is not up to the mark when you compare with same segment mobiles like honor 6x etc.. in terms of stability while capturing the picture. to be honest mobile gives you the massive look but back panel is bit disappointing but you can beautify it with some metal/plastic case,3000mah is again lack in the race but if you are not a game lover that wont be a problem for you.	5
25979	nice looks,good display but seems smaller than other 5.5 inch phones	3
25980	Compact size. Good for easy handling .	4
25981	i dropped my phone. the back camera glass was broken. i couldn't find a service center	1
25982	Picture not bad, sounds are not clear ,battery not bad	4
25983	Alrernate to costly one's.	5
25984	I like the phone very much.it has amazing quality.	5
25985	Really a good phone in sound, camera, battery life.Just one concern that it did not come with headset.	4
25986	Soon as you turn on the screen the reaction is 'wow',Awesome screen, it's so big, covers most of the front body,the chin is so small.FHD+ screen makes it a treat for the eyes.Turn the device over and u are greeted with a shining sparkling glass back which although is a fingerprint magnet but looks so cool that u would never complain. This device is so beautiful and look better than most phones in this price rangeVery good battery life almost lasts more than one day on moderate to high usage.Performance wise the Kirin 710 is so good. Almost comparable to SD636 or SD660.Games like PUBG,Asphalt 9 runs smoothly without any lags whatsoeverOne interesting thing to note is that, There is a dedicated SD card slot along with 2 SIM card slots, which would allow u to insert 2 SIM Cards and an SD card at the same time which is usually absent in many present devices.The speakers are not that loud but they are totally decent and fits the profile also the headphone jack though present could have been a bit louder.Camera is the only incompetent thing in this device.The picture quality is avarage on both front and back and there is a bit more preprocessing that gets done on the photo on both front and back cameras.AI feature is great but the photos lack a natural look and sometimes look edites. There is no 4k video support,60Fps video or OIS and EIS.I will recommend this device to anyone who wants to buy a mid range phone under 20k.The device come pre applied with a screen protector and also has a clear case in the box	5
25987	I usually buy from Amazon but don't post any review. But this time I am posting a review because of highly disappointment.1. Most of apps are not optimised for notch.2. Phone does not support WiFi 5G band(even honor 8 Pro supports the same and come at price tag of 22900 with 128 gb storage & better processor).3. Fast charger not provided in box.4. So basic earphones are provided.5. Processor is not as good.The only main point to buy this device is premium look with Notch. Nothing else!!I have shared my true experience.Still If you want purchase then please go for it.	1
25988	Nice product comfortable in hands	4
25989	Mi A2 phone is so so and face unlock is very bad and charger is not good. I am not satishfied with this.	2
25990	Camera clearity is not good as expected, and mobile performance is good,	3
25991	Screen quality, camera quality, everything par	5
25992	Great look. Nice work.Little heating issue.Little disappointed with battery life and camera otherwise the phone is great...camera quality can be betrer.........	4
25993	Honor 8X is really an awesome product. Except the camera, Camera is also good enough but images look little artificial... Display, Battery life, Sound quality, and its design is great... Happy with Honor 8X	4
25994	Battery backup no,and heating	1
25995	good phone at a reasonable price	4
25996	◘ Built with 7000 Series Aluminum ◘The phone built quality is unique and premium from its counterpart device, The metallic frame is made up of strong 7000 series aluminum although the back panel is made up of plastic instead of metal.◘ Full HD + FullVision Display ◘FullVision Screen is the most talked feature of this handset just like LG G6 it comes up with 5.5 inches IPS Full HD+ FullVision 18:9 Wide screen having very narrow bezels.◘ A Decent Primary Camera ◘The phone has 13 MP primary Camera having f/2.2 Aperture, although on the Pixel count both the camera are same although when it comes to the quality you can see the difference. The photos taken from the Rear 13 MP camera are quite decent with good details but this is not the same case with the 5 MP secondary camera.◘ Entry Level Chipset ◘This is a mid-range smartphone with entry-level CPU, It is powered by Qualcomm MSM8940 Snapdragon 435 octa-core processor clocked at 1.4 GHz. This chipset is coupled with 3 GB RAM offering a decent day to day performance However it is incapable of handling heavy games and multitasking as well.◘ Battery Backup ◘Company offering 3000 mAh battery inside the phone which is providing Talk Time of 14 Hours and 136 Hours Standby Time. So in mixed use, you will get nearly about one full day battery backup.+ PROS OF LG Q6• Dual SIM Slot with Dedicated micro SD Slot.• Crystal clear 5.5 1080p full HD + Full Vision Display.• The frame is Made of 7000-grade Aluminium.• Face recognition/ KnockCode for Unlocking the phone.• OTG Cable is supported.• NFC is supported by the device.• Built on Military standard 810G certification.-CONS OF LG Q6• The under-powered processor for multitasking or heavy Gaming.• No Type-C USB Slot.• The battery is non-removable.• The Camera especially Secondary is not up to the mark.• Speaker located at the back with mediocre sound.• It is disappointing to see the mid-range phone without fingerprint scanner.	4

26030	This Product proves value for money	4
26031	Honor 8x is awesome handset.. For watching HD videos and for gaming experience.. In this range..	5
26032	Superb phone to buy under 15k.With exchange offer and other festival offers got it very cheap.Arguably the most beautiful phone barring S8 and Honor 8 pro.Looks so beautiful that you will hesitate to put a case on it.You won't believe the quality of screen on such a cheap phone.Initially shows some heating issues that goes away with 5 days use.Not meant for heavy gamers or pro photographers. Great for all others.Screen PPI is great for VR applications and videos.Great software interface from LG with not much bloatware and great customisation.Negatives: No finger print scanner (face unlocking is wonderful even though not as effective as finger print). No NFC. Cameras just great for average user.	5
26033	Weight	3
26034	Good picture quality nd i love it	5
26035	Low quality mobile waste of money sounds & display is very poor looks are very low budget but price is more	1
26036	Battery life and quality of camera is very good thank you Amazon and Redmi. Thanks Amazon phone good and on time delivery	4
26037	I am using this phone from last 1 month, i change phone every year . I have used mobile of brands like moto, redmi, htc, lenovo etc. But this is my worst choice , ordered on very first day on launch, I realise my mistake within one day of delivery. following are my observations which will help the prospective buyer.Only phone screen is good, rest of the things are average. Both cameras are not up to mark, rear camera photo are blurred when taking photos of moving object. Not so good processor, average interface {LG should learn from Redmi}, battery drains faster & taking longer time to charge, face recognition is not good comparing to fingerprint, cannot recognise your face when light is low.Overall very bad choice for 15k.Also return policy of Amazon is not user friendly very hopeless service I will not buy any mobile from Amazon in future.	1
26038	Hanging problem, When calling, usb cable is very small, sound is not good, battery quality is also very low compare to redmi note4, Quality is very bad,	1
26039	Good experience for 1st time Android one users. 👍	4
26040	Ignore all the people who are complaining. For the prize, tgis mobile gives you literally everything you need. No dual cameras but that single camera itself takes really really good quality pictures and the selfie camera is awesome too. The display? It's just gorgeous. Way gorgeous than it looks in the pictures put up. There are really no heat issues. People who are complain might really be driving the mobile crazy like a laptop. You don't need MI or Meizu or Oppo or the over prized sony mobiles. This is the catch. Go for it.	5
26041	Super quality product honour 8x, honour be brave	5
26042	Face lock is not properly supportedVery poor quality of face lock	4
26043	Over all good performance, last month onwards I am using this phone. good one	4
26044	Very good phone .Quality is awesome. Though finger print sensor is missing but other features are awesome.face detection method need to be improved.	4
26045	Phone is good for regular use.no lagging and does the work good.the front camera is not so good and rear camera clicks good pic in good light conditions.the sound is low.the phone works best in normal usage like you tube viewing , downloading movies ,gace book wats app etc.	4
26046	Happy for buying the product, really worth at this price bracket.	5
26047	Good quality mobile in this price range.	5
26048	Very poor mobile 📱ullu banaya one 🌟 jyada hai company wale logo ko chutiya bana rahe hain koi es mobile ko mat lena please i requist galti se bhi mat lena	1
26049	It's my 8th day of the usage it's was amazing performance. Battery backup super camera quality super display super. Sound is little bit worry.. Not provided headset with box. Using other devices headset. Maybe the reason.. Otherwise paka for the value for the money..	5
26050	Sound Quality could've been slightly better.	5
26051	front camera is not  gud and click picture  then picture have dots screen is lagre so problem in the handel soo..this product is not refund  so order cairfully  ......	3
26052	There's no TP protective film pre applied or sent in the box.Coming to phone its a very good one at this price range	4

26056	Camera :)Battery :(	4
26057	Only MI........	5
26058	Blasting product	5
26059	Firstly I would like to state that, its par below iPhone XS max 😜. Yes many of the consumers need iPhone like quality in 15k, but thats not a case. Phone is worth the price.Screen quality - 10/10Battery - 10/10UI - 9/10Camera - 8/10Sound - 9/10	5
26060	6 pro fron camera is poor performance.	3
26061	I bought this for my dad. Dad is happy with this phone.	5
26062	Nice mobile with awesome picture quality, looks premium in hand but with average sound quality battery life is also good lasts for 1 day	4
26063	Nice product and value for money	4
26064	Xellent phone i m kissing it again and again..hey lg brand u r absolutely awsmm😘	5
26065	Need a better stock camera application close to Google camera to get a good quality pictures	4
26066	No FM, No audio jack, No Expandable memory.The only good part is Camera of the phone.Don’t buy because you won’t be able to replace it with other Xiaomi phone.	1
26067	Good overall, just its speaker sounds weird while incoming call ringing, seems problem with speaker.	4
26068	Awesome product. With latest features front and back LED flash. Camera quality is better than many high end phones. Added is Samsung software which is trust worthy. Battery backup is awesome. One thing is missing is notification Led.	5
26069	Good mi ,,, thanks Amazon	5
26070	Excellent camera quality, average battery life	5
26071	Good. lil disappointed with the camera. health to your pocket and value for money if you manage to get it under 15k by availing discounts...Its been 2 months since i bought it. I can give you the most genuine review.If you really want a good budget phone, go for redmi note 5 pro. I have used all 3 phones, note 5 pro, redmi note 5 and g6. I am a pubg player and it runs worst in g6. Even camera quality of note 5 is much better than g6, sound quality is better in note 5( mind it i am talking about note 5 and not note 5 pro which is even better phone than note5). Note 5 gives you a larger screen than g6. But if still someone interested in buying g6 as it has got better lifetime than redmi phones( i agree upon that) with oreo android, you can contact me (8699992622). The phone is two months old with back cover and screen guard but in totally new condition, no scratch, all parts are genuine ( nothing changed) i will sell it for 13000 (fixed price ofcourse)😃	4
26072	MOBILE NOT GOOD SORRY TAKLU	1
26073	The product is good ,worth of money , good gameplay,good battery life,picture quality is very good with more than 6 inches display	5
26074	Awesome phone.. Camera to good, Battery life very good, any heavy game support and performance too good, overall good product at this price. No doubts	5
26075	My Mi 6pro mobile is always struck the touch i think ur sent to refurbished mobile what i vl do	2
26076	Hi,  I got this phone @12,999 from amazon on Diwali discount after exchanging my old phone and it costs me around 8500, So as per price this phone is all good for me5 Points for its look and UI5 Points for its touch behaviour3.5 For its cameraThe main issue is its battery drainage problem and heating issue. I have updated the latest OS but still the problem exists. Overall the phone is good if LG can solve the heating and battery drainage issue.	4
26077	no there is still problem in phone and its price also went down last time I buyed it for 15990 now its price is 13990 so I dont want any replacement I just want my money backREAD MORE	1
26078	missed so many features like u not able to delete messages all once u need to do manual..message tone we can,t set what we want no option at all..and no auto brightness sensor..no remote sensor..no fast charging..no natch display...processor using old version...not support HD videos...after few days its started hanging the mobile...i simply wasted my 19k money..	2
26079	I wish we could give negative ratings here. This phone is literally waste of money. LG has actually lost its standards and came up with a worst phone like this one. My trust over LG is over now. The phone started showing issues right after 1 month of usage. Processor is super slow, lot of software related issues and prime issue is the battery which drains like water. Has issues with the normal network and data speed of or above 4G. I would suggest you buy the cheapest phone of any other brand but LG Q6. No resale value and you don't even get cover case in the market. Device sound is too low. Basically all cons but only one pro that is the front camera is good.	1
26080	This phone is ok but cemara qyality is not gud. I think MI wants to work on this.	3
26081	bad network, WiFi connection bad, screen cast bad, no call recording, hotspot bad, usb tethering useless needs immediate software update for everythingREAD MORE	1
26082	Picture quality is okSound quality is goodBettery life is awesome	5
26083	Overall very bad phone never buy this seriously hopeless waste of money	1
26084	Best smart phone under 15000	5
26085	Its a very nice mobile	4
26086	I have used it for 1 months. As per my opinion this phone is very very good and his performance beyond my expectation. The battery is very very good & the sound quality awesome, picture quality also great. The main things which is attract me is the stock Android this is awesome just awesome.	5
26087	Best phone at its price range and better then  other branded phones .3gb ram with 32 gb fastest storage technology it feels really awesome in hands....	5
26088	Worst Camera Quality, it is much worsted than the Red mi 5, very disappointing, please suggest any settings to improve the quality or Workarounds, Thanks.	1
26089	Good phone with in the price range.	5
26090	First of all if you are buying this mobile under 10000 than you will not regreat. Here are some points which I noted after 1 week usePros:-1-Display- USP of this phone.Very bright.means its perfect.love that. 18:9 ratio is cool2-Overall look- awesome very stylist gives rich look.3-Battery- Easily last for a day with moderate uses.4-Dedicated micro sd slot5-face recognition.Cons:-1- Proccesser- gets slow down laggimg while playing games using multiple apps.2- camera ok not so good3- backcover made of plastic.4- does not have fingerprint sensor but has face recogitions feature which works very good.5- heating like hell while plyaing games.I bought this phone in sale with a very old phone exhangeTotal cost 8300. In this cost I am happy with produt. Cost should below 10000.	4
26091	Camera quality too good hai, battery backup bhi bahut accha hai... totally phone bahut accha hai...	4
26092	only camera is Good, phone doesn't have as much options as lower modal has. I updated phone 3 times, still not functionality, like limited shortcuts, no gesture, no inbuilt ringtones, no auto call recording. I am regrading after purchasing this mobile.	1
26093	Mi a2 best for camera loverBettry backup is not good	5
26094	Very good deal	5
26095	Pros:1. Design is really good - 5.5 inch screen device made so small. It's almost the size of an iPhone62. The screen layout is amazing. Curved edges adds the cherry on cream.3. Built quality is definitely good.4. Good battery life if not using mobile data, once charged completely.Cons:1. The back metal case is very vulnerable to scratches and it's a finger print magnet2. Charging the battery is DAMN slow! At times, I've felt like trashing the device. It took 270 mins from 17% to 74%.3. Camera screen looks good, but the picture quality is not to the expectation.4. Pic capture speed is slow.5. The worst part is, the volume rockers stopped working just after 45 days of it purchase and only 4 service centres across Bangalore.6. Lastly, there are less normally used apps in 18:9 aspect ratio. All videos pay in 16:9 only. May be we'd just need to wait for more time.Overall experience hasn't been good at all. I paid 12,999/- and feel that I paid the amount only for it's display.Planned for an exchange, but this model is not option either :(	2
26096	Decent design from MI team...Thanks for this wonderful Product.Thanks Amazon for your services...	5
26097	awesome phone.....READ MORE	5
26098	Screen is small without that everything okay	5
26099	VERY BAD BATTERY. PEOPLE PLANNING TO BUY THINK TWICE. REALLY DISPPOINTING	1
26100	Very poor, don't buy	1
26101	Product is very nice.	4
26102	Great phone and features. Absolutely amazing and I love it. But the phone feels heavy on hand. Phone build is excellent for the price and feels very premium	5
26103	worth buy	5
26104	Batteryperformance is incredibly well ( it does kill apps to do so unless excluded)Camerapics seem artificial sometimes (with AI mode enabled)No lag what so ever in UIGamingis good (but PUBG doesn't runs on high settingsOverall a good package for heavy media consumer	4
26105	Mobile is good but clour is not perfect red. it is like a pink colour.	4
26106	Very worst mobile in photos.,totally waste honor 8x,even one picture also clarity. Look like 5mega pixel picture, after taken picture if you zoom slightly image will break full, zero percentage in clarity, if you 10 pic, at least one or two only good, if you flash light it will blink but not reflect in picture,	1
26107	Just amazing..!! Go for it.	5
26108	There is some hanging issues..	4
26109	It was good option of exchange offer.	3
26110	Everything is top notch. Except battery backup. My suggestion is turn off battery percentage indicator. If not it will make you sad. And Sometimes camera not focusing on the subject what we want shoot in portrait mode. But it is a great camera.	5
26111	"Purchased the phone on 13th October and I already wish I had returned the phone when I still could. I was hopelessly waiting for the promised ""updates"" to fix the issues. Here are just some of them-The proximity sensor is as good as not having it. You would rather want to use earphones then go through the trouble of checking if mistakenly the flashlight has been switched on with the ear taps on the screen.Oh, but that will only last so long. Because sooner than all other phones I have used, this needs to be put to charge.Like it's not bad enough, my display starts flickering occasionally and sometimes the GPS sensor just won't work. Until you reboot ofcourse, because why not."	1
26112	Feels like a average phone in this price segment. Using Mi from 4 years. So I was expecting more quality in camera. Though, display is fine with FHD+.	3
26113	Good phone with wonderful camera..there is no gallery,no ringtones n what app tones uploaded.. overall a good buy in sale .	5
26114	Its mi remote does not work	4
26115	Mobile is best but your is worst make delivery fast as possible	5
26116	I liked the price	5
26117	Overall is good.but camera bakwas Hai..	3
26118	Device is cool and neat . Picture quality is great . Battery is average but not bad .	5
26119	Buy only if you want  hold a phone having a 18:9 display ratio and else do not waste your money.Pros: Display and Curve design looks good.  voice clarity is good.Cons:It a just below average phone and not worth for the price of 15K.Both Front and rear camera are below average(Coolpad 2.5D cameras are way better than this )Battery drains quickly.It 's so called advanced security feature Face reorganization does not work properly even in  Good lighting condition , forget about this feature in low light conditions. They would have gone with Finger print scanner apart from It 's so called advanced security feature Face reorganization.Back panel is made up of plastic and It's prone to slippery.SIM1 Slot supports VoLTE and SIM 2 supports only 2G network.Speaker is located on back and Speaker volume is not upto the mark.I want return this phone as it is not worth but Amazon claiming to return and refund applicable for this phone	1
26120	Features are good as expected. Dual camera is fine when taken in day light though the front camera is awesome.	4
26121	6000₹ Redmi 6A have miui 10. but No miui 10 available in this phone very bad	1

26126	It's a Snapdragon 425 after all. Lags  a bit. It's pretty obvious after gaming for a short time. It's an okay deal. Not money's worth for sure.	2

26133	All n all a good phoneat prize but although I purchased 4gb 64 gb variant the speed of the phone is just below expectations otherwise in other aspects this is good gadget..	3
26134	It's quite foolish to buy this phone. If it weren't for that Samsung logo on it, the device should cost nothing more than 12k₹	1

26144	love this phone...worth every penny....it's a looker and decent specs..dnt forget to use a back cover..back is scratch prone and cover makes it luk more good looking also..display is b'ful....yes it does heat a bit below volume button..i guess due to processor fixed there....but u wn't feel a thing with cover on...go for it..LG has finally hit it out of park	5
26145	Nice budget phone with good quality camera and sound and picture too	5
26146	Top notch phone. All my friends suggested me to buy moto G5s or redmi but i went with LG Q6, guess what tjey are all jealous now. Phone feels like a premium device in hands. Slightly heating but thats OK. Camera is also fine not disappointing. Just go for it and see for yourself...this phone rocks!!	5

26198	Good for photos and performance. Battery hangs on a day if you use heavily else 1. 5 day or even more. Speed charging is not that fast it takes around 1 and half hour for full charge. Very premium look so slim at this price everything is good except battery which is not expected at this price. It is expected around 3500mah battery and that would have laced the phone Over top models. Camera is one of the best feature of the phone. Sound quality is too good when compared to honor 6x and 7x and other phones. Loud speaker also good enough.	4

26245	It is a best smartphone in this price	4
26246	I bought this week from a local shop. Absolutely stunning design. The aspect ratio and the rounded screen corners align so beautifully with the phone countours - it is really a very elegant looking phone. The LG UI is also very nice and friendly. After buying I now feel that all phones should use this 18:9 format as it makes the phone narrow enough to hold very comfortably in one hand.  The response is smooth and have not seen any stuttering (I don't play games or videos) - browsing, photos, documents.The default Home screen does not have the app drawer. But on clicking 'Update Softwares' it can download 'Home UI 4.0' from LG's own portal. Selecting this in the settings brings back the app drawer.I also very happy with the 'Comfort View' option that filters out blue light and makes viewing the screen much more comfortable - there are 3 levels of filtering to choose from.Initial 4 days, battery would drain out in 2 days time. But now after 3 complete full empty +charge cycles, the battery is now dropping only 3% in 12 hrs, so can last 5 days of standy time (without Data/Wifi/Bluetooth/Location).I updated the OS to the 14Feb2018 release through LG Bridge PC software. Now the animation is faster and speaker volume appears to be higher now. No other change could be seen. The battery is now holding on better - only 2-3% discarge over 12 hours overnight.	5
26247	Look very nice...red color ... sound & night time cam quality poor	4
26248	Since beginning, play store not responding and Whatsapp, shareit and other apps are not getting download. Have talked to motorola support as well but couldn't resolve	1

26292	All function is very good qaulity on this handset	5
26293	Battery draining fastly	5
26294	Slowly working, bulky, heavy weight	3
26295	I would say go for other mobile than this , after one of buying this I could see that price got reduced to 2k lesss and ... I would say that not that much okay .	5
26296	The only reason for me to buy this phone is its Display.The 18:9 aspect ratio makes its so comfortable for one hand use that despite being at 5.5 inches, it feels sleeker than a 5.1 inch phone.Full Marks to the Display for its IPS panel and excellent sunlight legibility.There is barely any body above and below the screen.This is not a 2.5D glass, but the corners of the screen are rounded.The sound is average for speaker phone, but somehow loud enough for the audio while playing songs or viewing videos.The rear camera belongs to 2014, while the front is from 2015. I will give those a pass.Only consolation is that there is EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) for video and front camera has 100 degrees for groupfies.The battery lasted 1.5 days with single sim and almost 4-6 hrs of screen on time.Supports VOLTE natively, without need to install any apps either for HD audio calls for video calls.Can play some casual games on it, but not too graphic intensive ones.Finally, being MIL-STD-810G compliant, it can withstand some abuse.Also, got a great deal on exchanging my old phone and also got zero percent EMI option, so that's a sweetener.	5
26297	Battery life excilent. Sound also very good.picture quality not good.	4
26298	Smartphone has n number of features and quality along with great unibody design. Somewhere it loses Notch which is in trend.	4

26302	Beautiful phone at this budget. Thanks to LG. Only onr drawback is finger print sensor. If not serious about sensor, this is thr best phone at this price level	5
26303	Best phone in the market under range 12000 and no comparison with other phone. I love this Redmi 6 pro	5
26304	i loved this phone thank u amazon	5
26305	Not as good as expected, except that it has 2 dedicated sim slots that i was in need of.. Battery heats up, smaller life and discharges quickly, guess processing speed is slow as well, notch is a waste as it doesn't show battery percentage/connection speed or any other info that could have been utilised in that small strip. Only thing postive compared to Mi note 4 and Mi note 5 is that keyboard is super smooth.	3
26306	Good and nice peace	4

26334	Last week I got this phone. It is a good phone camera are average but still good enough. Battery is very good charging once a day. Speakers are also good nice sound. Notch is not working in few apps. Its a money worthy phone you can go for this phone.	4
26335	😥😥😥	1
26336	Its huge display makes it look like a very premium phone(Navy Blue). Overall phone is decent for the price but still should have given fast charging though battery life is just truly awesome, cameras both front n back could have been better n I hope Honor, atleast gives a EIS update very soon. Plz honor provide double tap to lock n wake up device through update.	4
26337	I have been using this product for quite a long time. I've used it for gaming, photography, music and video extensively. Here's my experience with this phone.Picture QualityIt won't be wrong if I say that this phone has the best camera in the 20k segment phones. The camera is highly reliable and takes some amazing images. The portrait mode provided works very good though you need to be in a range of 2meters to take a good portrait shot.Sound QualityThe audio output of the phone is considerably good. I never faced any difficulty with the output during audio or video playback. The speakers are mounted on the bottom of the phone which makes it even better.Battery LifeIf you have seen the reviews of this phone before it received Pie then you'll find the battery life to be very bad. But after it received 9.0 the battery life is really improved. It easily lasts upto 8 hrs when fully charged.SoftwareThe phone comes with Android One so, you can be assured that it will receive the latest updates on time.	5

26345	Finally! I received my replacement new handset from LG. Thank you LG  for your superb customer service!	4
26346	No fingerprint sensor	4
26347	Worst phone ever by MI. Viewing angle, Sensor and display are poorest i have ever seen.Light sensor didn't work properly. Many times display on during call.Having 3030mah battery , it last for 3-4 hr on time display. Company didn't provided the fast charger but it still showing fast charging by the normal charger..LOLthats a joke..Camera is decent not the best.Most disappointing was the football ground size bezel on top and bottom.One and Only positive is having a Stock android phone. Sanpdragon 660 SOC didn't stand good in this phone..Now consider this, it doesn't have dedicated sd card slot and Ear phone jack.Totally garbage if you invest your 17k or 20k in this.	2
26348	If you want a decent mobile which works smartly then just go for it.... Its really awesome ...... The display are too good. And its look like you handle an iphone .....:))))))) thank you amazon and LG....;)	5
26349	Mobile is a nice	5
26350	Been waiting for this device for months and booked as soon as it was live on Amazon. Here is my experience after using for 10 days.Look & Feel - By far the best in the mid range smartphone market. The blue variant is mind blowing amd it will catch everyones attention.Performance - The performance of this phone is beyond expectations. Kirin 710 is truly outstanding.Camera - Rear camera is best in class but the front camera needs few improvements, the low light shots aren't that good. Still I would say it has one of the best camera in the segment.Sound - I feel this is where this phone looses out a bit. The audio output through 3.5mm jack is big let down but I hope it can be improved via software update. The speaker output is average.Signal & call quality - excellent signal reception and call quality is clear. I used to have network issue on my redmi 4 previously with Jio but on 8x no such issues.Looking at the price I would say this is the best phone in the proce segment that you can get. Just go for it.	5
26351	Great absoulately	5
26352	Excellent mobile...excellent performance...looks premium...	5
26353	Phone is good for it's price but right from the day 1, one speaker is not working..Amazon has not send any soft copy of bill on my mail due to which I m not able to get it repaired at service center.	3
26354	good product in this price range .....	5
26355	Nice but their is some problems like video is not full screen that I means video is not playing with notch,notch is for looking, nothing in working, product is not pack properly,back cover not provided, sounds quality not like Vivo v7, front camera not clear but back is good.	1
26356	The phone heats up easily even on moderate use. I bought this for my mother and she use the phone for regular calls only and even then it is getting warm very soon	1
26357	Battery would not last more than 4 to 5 hours on 4G and Wifi.Worst product ever bought online....Speaker gets on automatically, loses bluetooth connection, does not latch to 4G data till reboot... and many more to come.	2
26358	1) Preliminary apps also not included with this software like dual SIM ringtone etc.(2) Battery life is very poor, b cause it is not for 6 hours on network usage (3) c typpe charger is good, but lack of 3.5 jack is a 100 percent dissatisfaction.	4
26359	brought a product as a diwali gift and had a embrasing situation as it is not starting and now i am at long away from service centre. never thought of such a quality of mobile	1
26360	Smart buy in budget	4
26361	another proudact better than	1
26362	I've purchased this phone for 13500, which is a great deal in my opinion. One thing where this phone excels is camera.This camera is awesome and performs very good in low light too.I've never expected these camera results from a phone of this price category.Battery is average in my opinion, if you are just a casual user, it can last a working day.You definitely have to charge at night.I still miss headphone jack.Turning off mi sound enhancer gives better and clear sound output via earphones.	5

26376	"It is good but not Fantastic considering the price and the hardware you get.!Premium feel and awesome display.Never feel that you are holding a 5.5"" phone.Camera should have been better, while using maps, Video recording I can feel that it warms near camera.Not suitable for gaming and price would have been 10k to gain the market.Overall it is okay."	3

26383	Battery & sd card not supported, and low photo quality and amazon is frod for me	1
26384	Huawei has treated the P20 Lite quite well - the phone comes bundled with an 18W fast charger, a USB Type-C cable, and a headset.A case isn't included as it was with many other Huawei and Honor phones, but we appreciate the provided fast charger.I am not a tech reviewer, but this cell phone is the best looking phone the money can buy in the segment. Using it from the last 1 month never faced any problem. Do not try to put on bulky cover to ruin its look, just install a front and back transperent Tempered and turn the heads.	5
26385	Split screen is a plus. Prices crashed within a month.	3
26386	Purchased 32gb verient on 1st sale. It is a very good budget phone. No problem till now. Running smoothly. No heating problem. I am not a gamer, so i didn't test heavy games on it. Notch design is little bigger. Overall a value for money phone.	5

26405	Battery is getting discharged quickly.only that one is drawback for this phone.	2
26406	It's very nice. U can purchase it. It's full paise wasule	5
26407	Pros:1.  Build quality is looking to be premium (feels premium)2.  EMUI is good, has got lot of features (minimizing the screen size, good themes, battery manager, etc)3.  Battery life is good and last for about 1 day (for about 4-6 hours video streaming intermittently) - not tested fully, but seems to be good for 6.5 inch screen.4.  Camera performance is very good under good lighting conditions (outdoor and indoor with good light settings).5. Back transparent cover coming in the box.cons:1.  takes about 2.30 - 2.45 hours to charge fully. (no fast charging)2.  Slow motion is just for 10 seconds and that too not pretty good with normal light settings (has lots of noises)3.  Indoor picture with normal lighting is enhanced unnecessarily, (not sure if it can be turned off of something), looks artificial at times.4.  Would be great if the Tempered glass is also provided in the box.My take: This is a very good phone for 17k (i have 6 GB ram phone), which you can buy.	4
26408	Battery and sound and touch not good	1
26409	The speaker sound is low when compared to other devices.	4
26410	Very nice phone. All features well. Camera color saturation is little problem.But overall nice phone.	5
26411	It's very smooth to handleGud for price money!!	4
26412	Pros:• Amazing looks and build with full aluminium casing although that makes it slippery at times• Display is good• You will get all latest updates for AndroidCons:• Battery had to better as it lasts hardly a full day with average 4G usage• Gets heated at times either with certain apps running and during charging• Camera output not really what is claimed	3
26413	Display not proper in 1St week itself.	1
26414	Good phone from xiaomi. Best phone under 10k.Picture quality was goodBattery life-lastlong for 18 hoursLooks good n premium	5
26415	I have brought LGQ6 + it is good in few aspectsGood-------------------------------------------------------screen size,clarity,internal memory andresponse.Size of the phone (very handy)Bad-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------quick drain of Battery,heating problem,back side metal gets scratchy and yuk if don't get a back cover immediately (disgusting design though.... on back),Calls gets cut intermittently since phone will be unable to receive signals consistently (though I don't exactly claim the fault with mobile but this is regular with this phone with all kind of net works at all places-experienced personally)P.S. The idea of bezelless screen in totally cool, it would have been awesome if they could have released all plastic body like nexus 5 and 5x type single piece rather than getting two variants half ly done.	2
26416	Its good in this range	4
26417	Better Camera and Performance	5
26418	Waste of time and money dont go for Flipkart ,they are only for selling not for the customer satisfaction.This time i bought 2 things both are very poor quality and most of all the services provided by Flipkart  was  not upto that mark as i say worst.READ MORE	1

26472	The product is beautiful to look at, specially the display unit and sleek handful design.

26506	I am writing this review after nearly 3 weeks of usage after buying.  Got it at a great deal during the Great Indian Festival in Oct, including discounts, cash back and exchange.  The phone is a very good budget / mid level phone as expected from Moto.  Actually I would like to give it 3.5 star rating, but since the provision is not there, I am giving a 4 star rating.The screen has very good resolution, the phone is much lighter and the finger print scanner works very fine.  The call quality and speaker/mic is also good.I use the phone extensively to access mails, various apps and calls. I am not a gamer and in fact i have not installed any gaming app in my phone.  So my review may be viewed in that context.I had a Moto X Play earlier which I exchanged and bought this phone.  Apart from the good Moto quality which is always there, I was essentially looking at the RAM (for better speed) & Camera quality when I was buying this phone.  I was happy to see dual camera etc in the specifications, and expected a lot from the Camera, and hence bought the phone.However, the camera quality is above average (compared to Moto standards though it will be much better than the other cheap / Chinese phones), but not all that great.  In fact, Moto X Play camera was much better.  I am told that Moto X Force Camera is also good.  The present camera though is good, but not great !  Particularly, it does not have wide angle for selfie clicking, and hence selfie photos without selfie stick does not give good wide angle coverage.  Also, pics in low light are not good, but those in better lighting conditions are very good.Another disadvantage is that the phone does not have 'Gallery'.  Therefore, every time you want to view or delete a pic, or any other file, you either need to go to Google Photos or go to file manager and select individual folders of various apps to access the file that you want to view / delete.  This is quite cumbersome, and I hope that in the forthcoming upgrades, this issue will be addressed.Also, the phone seems to lag a bit while accessing the SD memory card.  I am not sure whether the problem is with the SD card (bought a new Class 4 Scandisk SDHC) or with the phone itself.  I have not faced this problem with any phone that I had used earlier.  Though it does not interfere with the normal functioning, when you try to access the various files stored in the Memory card for viewing / deleting, it is annoyingly slow.The battery life is just about OK for a day's medium usage.  I need to charge it every day whereas in the Moto X Play even after 2 yrs of usage, the battery used to last longer.  If you use the Internet extensively for browsing / apps, the battery needs to be charged even more often.  It is my apprehension that as the phone gets older, the battery may not last as much as it does today!!  The Turbo charger provided is good and the battery gets charged rapidly within about one and half hours.So in my opinion, go for this phone if the budget is a constraint.  The phone per se is a good budget phone. However, if you can afford a bit more, may be you can look at better models.	3
26507	Overall the phone is good in this range	4
26508	Excellent phone for normal usage users.For me mobile phones must have three thing1) build quality2) camera3) good processor	4
26509	Not good one also heating problem while internet. Ringing volume issue and back cover is very low quality.	2
26510	Just compare Samaung J8 and Samsung On8. No difference. except price.I ordered for On8.but during deliver i got J8 with cover as On8. Samsung has rebranded with price only	5

26519	Phone is worth for the price.	4
26520	Very poor camera quality. Not at all worth according to cost.	1
26521	I'm writing this review after using the phone more than a week.Though the phone comes with the older chipset snapdragon 625 the phone manages to give you smooth & fast experience.In the day light the rear camera works very fine and takes crystal clear photos.But in the low light condition the camera struggles a bit.And though the front camera is 5mp still it will you give you decent photos for social sharing.And the battery performance is really impressive.It will give you almost 2day battery backup with average Uses.There is no heating issues.The display comes with full HD plus resolution with the ppi of 441The best display one will get in this price range.The phone look very stylish with the notch and so handy to use.HenceThis phone will provide you almost 2day battery backup, smooth performance, good shots.So, The redmi 6 pro is a good choice and worth the money.	5
26522	Good phone. Camera pictures are more than real I feel!	4

26530	Pros:1.Rear Camera doesn't just blindly blur the background like the effect we see in most of the phones, its like genuine defocusing the background and focusing the required object2. Low light pictures are great3. Battery despite being 3000mah, gives a decent battery performance.4. Primary speaker sound is very good and has a depth to the sound5. Comes with a 5V Charger and charges pretty fastCons:For me it wasn't a problem as I mostly use Bluetooth headsets but definitely the absense of 3.5mm jack is quite a downside.No external SD support	5
26531	Picture quality is super wowBattery is also good . Good charging speed ..Sound is fabulous......	5

26539	My dislike about product is1. Battery backup is not good up to mark.2. Phone is heating when charging3. My previous phone is mi note 4 I will compare to mi a2 . Note 4 have dual app options but mi a2 we need to install parallel space. And one please improve battery backup.	4
26540	Its an awesome mobile.. i have been using it from last 3 months it is so fabulous. One thing is it takes 2hours to charge from 0 to 100, it is not a drawback for me atleast as it gives full day backup even after continuous usage.. Jio works perfectly well when compared to other mobiles signal carrier service is good.	5
26541	I like this LG phone	5

26544	Nice mobile  battery life is very good	5
26545	This is the first Motorola phone for which I have given only 3 stars. The colour detailing is not up the mark which leads user to use the mobile for least.There is no natural sound in the handset and bass is just for the sake of bass ( I used beats headphones and still sound was not good).Battery life is not more than its predecessor phones which leads user to charge the mobile in every 7-8HRS.	3

26548	My new mobile  having scrathes	1
26549	LG Q6 REVIEWSPECS:• 5.5inch IPS in cell touch capacitive touchscreen with 1080 x 2160 pixels resolution, 442 ppi pixel density and 16M color support with Corning Gorilla Glass 3• 13MP primary camera and 5MP front facing camera with wide angle selfie• Android v7.1 Nougat operating system with 1.4GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 octa core processor, 3GB RAM, 32GB internal memory expandable up to 2TB• 3000mAH lithium-ion batteryDESIGN:• I have been using the phone for a few days now and it does feel quite sturdy in hand. The edges are metallic and rounded, which makes the phone easier to grip. While Gorilla Glass 3 protects the display from scratches, the plastic back gets scratched quite easily. The Gorilla Glass 3 display is also flat and not curved. The frame itself is made out of 7000 series aluminium, which is very durable.DISPLAY:• As for the display quality, it is a top notch panel and can easily be regarded as one of the best in the category. Viewing angles are very good and the colour saturation, though a bit warm, is favourable for viewing all kinds of content. It is easily viewable outdoors and under direct sunlight, and with luminance readings of 605 lux, offers ample brightness as well. The display has Gorilla Glass 3 protection on top for scratch protection and the touch response is quite good.PERFORMANCE:• Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 SoC and 3GB of RAM, the LG Q6 can barely keep up with the competition on synthetic benchmarks. That being said, if you are not into heavy gaming or don’t use processor intensive tasks, such as video editing apps, then you would find the overall experience of the phone good enough. You can have multiple (more than 20) apps in the task manager, download videos on Amazon Prime in the background and watch or stream YouTube videos at the same time, without the phone stuttering. It is a very capable processor but not for heavy usage.CAMERA:• The rear 13MP camera on the LG Q6 is also just about good enough. Images taken in all lighting conditions look rather subdued, but have ample details and sharpness. Images do tend to be grainy, as you move to low light settings, but most images do look usable. I believe the camera could have achieved more with a manual mode, but LG has kept the camera app very lackluster. Apart from panorama and food mode, the phone doesn't really let you tweak settings further.• The front facing 5MP camera also has the wide angle and normal selfie camera modes, taken from the G6. The image quality here is again just good enough, with softer focus, cleaning blemishes and dark spots. There is a skin tone slider as well, but unless you are outside in ample light conditions, the camera won’t do justice to your face or skin tone in selfies.BATTERY:• The LG Q6 brings a 3000mAh battery to the table, which is good enough for normal users. Using the phone as a daily driver I found that its battery is highly efficient and maintains its battery life quite well, even if you indulge in watching YouTube videos a lot.SIDE NOTES:• The Q6 comes with a “face unlock” feature, that works, but is a little slow.• Android 7.1 runs the show.VERDICT:• LG has put something different for the mid-ranger with it's 2160 x 1080p resolution display, which takes the aspect ratio from the standard 16:9 to 18:9. The top and bottom bezels have been drastically minimised, which adds to the phone’s unique look. And giving us a very capable cameras and battery. I say it is an all rounder phone for your daily needs.THANK You PEACE	5

26552	I am amazed to see how perfectly crafted and compact this phone is and how quickly Nokia stepping into the competition.Display is superb, better than Xiaomi phones in the segment. Camera is good. Unmatchable processor. Though speaker is not upto the par, which is the only problem that bothered me. Overall Nokia nailed it. Gaming experience is superb with no lags in Asphalt 9 or PUBG.READ MORE	4

Battery backup is quite good as compared to other devices. You can easily run Youtube online for 4hr 50min.6. Display quality is good7.face unlocking feature doing well.8. Battery backup on 2G network is quite impressive.9.Though you have 1.4Gz processor speed with 3GB ram there is such  lagging issues.10. Last one is , i can give 10/10 marks for looks...its having very good aesthetic look. N slim one.Cons.1. Heating issues when data connection is on. Phone left side from back get heated while playing video online or browsing2. No fast charging3. You can't switch fm channels using headphone button.4.face unlocking not works under low light/night5.Camera quality not impressive.ConclusionIf someone wants to experience a full vision display n face unlocking feature then this one is the best option at low budget cost.Otherwise 14.9k price is quite expensive if you compare with moto g5 plus n lenovo moto K8 note.	3
26603	I bought this for my wife and she loved it.Size ans shape : It's very different from other phone and seems like small but actually the screen to body ratio is pretty high.The setting are just good enough. Not so much for any android developer.Cons:Indian version doesn't have the fingerprint sensor.The charger is of only 1A which is not good for a 3000mAh battery. Should have been at least 2A	5

26613	The LG Q6 is good to go over almost all the smartphone present in Indian market including Samsung and other chinase at 10K price tag.  There are many reasons which supports my answer as follow except one thing as follow:-* Built Quility and Precision - Campare to any other it  has great display, aluminium frame with many more.  that Samsung can't provide at this price range.* Many other China's Smartphone companies does.  provide at cheaper price range, but when it come to it's.  Quility and Life of cellphone it does not stand at all.* People always think twice before buying any LG phone,  The reason, LG hasn't established much effort as.  Samsung did, like huge option & varites of phone for.  everyone,  But LG Q6 does good job which can lead  any Samsung J series phones.* One Bad experience with LG q6 is the heating and.  battery  concern.  To reduce it price lg q6 uses 3GB  RAM DDR3  (Dual Data Rate 3rd Generation) which  need slightly higher volt 1.5 then DDR4 which only got.  1.05V,  To provide data faster to CPU it gets  more heated due to higher current and volt which.  reduces battery faster. To overcome it LG has RAM.  optimizes software inbuilt# Finally, If you thinking to buy a phone which not made.  in.China, A good looking something different, Nice.  display  Camera, then deffenetly Buy it!Buy it.  https://amzn.to/2yDjLIi	4
26614	I bought my Mi A2 on 11th oct 2018 so its been close to 2 weeks since I have been using this device.I have the red color under direct white light it looks slightly pinkish and the camera hump is quite annoying but other than that the build quality and design is really nice. The phone is quite sleek and feels solid.For most of this review I will be using the Redmi note 4 as a point of reference as that was my previous phone.When buying a new phone my major requirements were Stock Android, Usb type- c and fast charging and good battery life.This phone was delivering on 2 fronts but according to reviews online it didn’t have a good battery life.I have been using this phone for 2 weeks now and the battery life has been average my usage is light to moderate so I get a Sot of about 5 hours which lasts me for 1 complete day as you can see in the pics. I have noted that playing 1 complete match of PUBG on WIFI I lose 13% of the battery on mobile data this rises to 15%. So if you use your phone to play a lot of games the battery will die much quicker and you can expect a SOT of 4 hours. The most important thing is that if you use your phone moderately you can get through a day and that’s what matters.I don’t play games but for the sake of this review I tried to play PUBG for at least 30 mins each day. I played on High and HD, by default it was set on a setting lower. The gameplay was smooth for most parts and more than playable but there are frame drops mostly when the area starts shrinking and when too many people drop at one location but while in combat I did not notice any frame drops.In updates department there are no complains I am on the October patch. So good work in the updates department but hope it remains same in the long run.Calls are quite clear and the speaker quality and loudness are good, not as good as stereo but better than many single speakers.Now lets talk of the elephant in the room that’s the lack of Headphone jack and no micro-sd card slot, they are definitely features I miss from my Redmi Note 4 and I hate Xiaomi for doing this. The slim design is great and now after using this phone all phones feel thicc but I would have preferred at least a headphone jack. The output from the usb c port is not bad but having to use a dongle every time is annoying.One more feature I think is great for me especially cause I don’t use my phone that carefully is having a Gorilla Glass 5 protection which prevents scratches better than glass 3 found on most phones in this segment.Not going to talk of the camera cause I don’t use camera a lot but for the brief moments I have used it I am more than satisfied.I was preferring the Honor play but during the sale this phone was for 15000 and honor was for 19000 so the price difference was huge so I bought this phone. So for 14000 (15000-1000(amazon pay cashback))  I am more than  satisfied with my purchase and I would recommend this phone if you want stock android and loss of a micro sd card is not a big issue. And I don’t think any phone at 14000 is as good as this one.	4
26615	Front camera not up to the mark. Battery laging.	3
26616	Picture quality is not so good. Rest all the things are really nice. The battery life is more than 1 and 1/2 days.	5
26617	Phone is good but earphones are missing in the box me and my friend buy this phone together earphone is available in my friend's phone box but not in my box	5
26618	SUPERB phoneKush Kar diya	5
26619	Picture quality is quite amazing and the battery life as well. Only part which I don't like a bit is the speakers, because the sound feels like it's only coming from one side and I'm more used to surround sound. But quite good for the price.	5
